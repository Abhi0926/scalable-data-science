All course content is currently being pushed by Raazesh Sainudiin after it has been tested in
Databricks cloud (mostly under Spark 1.6 and some involving Magellan under Spark 1.5.1).

The markdown version for `gitbook` is generated from the Databricks `.scala` and other source codes.
The gitbook version will lag behind the Databricks version available in the Databricks cloud.

Please feel free to fork the github repository: 

* [https://github.com/raazesh-sainudiin/scalable-data-science](https://github.com/raazesh-sainudiin/scalable-data-science).

Unfortunately, pull requests cannot be accepted until the end of June 2016 when the course completes
along with the course projects.

Furthermore, due to the anticipation of Spark 2.0 this mostly Spark 1.6 version could be enhanced with a 2.0 version-specific upgrade. 

Please send any typos or suggestions to raazesh.sainudiin@gmail.com
