All course content is currently being pushed by Raazesh Sainudiin after it has been tested in
Databricks cloud.

The markdown version for `gitbook` is generated from the Databricks `.scala` and other source codes.
The gitbook version will lag behind the Databricks version available in the Databricks cloud.

Please feel free to fork this github repository.

Unfortunately, pull requests cannot be accepted until the end of June 2016 when the course completes
along with the course projects.

All course participants (enrolled and observing students) may be able to do a course project if
their project proposal gets approved by Raazesh Sainudiin, the course coordinator.

Please send any typos or suggestions to raazesh.sainudiin@gmail.com
