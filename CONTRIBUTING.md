All course content is currently being pushed by Raazesh Sainudiin after it has been tested in databricks cloud. 

The mark-down`d version for gitbook is generated from the databricks .scala and other source codes.
The gitbook version will lag behind the databricks version available in the databricks cloud.

Please feel free to fork this github repository. 

Unfortunately, pull requests cannot be accepted until the end of June 2016 when the course completes.  

Please send any typos or suggestions to raazesh.sainudiin@gmail.com
