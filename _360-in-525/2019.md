# Overview of a 360-in-525 Minutes Course Set in Data Sciences, Spring 2019

**For PhD Students at Uppsala University and Researchers who want to upskill for Data Industry**


There will be one full-day workshop-style course worth 1hp.

This is partly supported by the Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics jointly with the Department of Mathematics in Spring 2019 and taught by domain experts in Privacy and Geospatial Analytics. 

Master students at Uppsala University must contact their study councellor in order to see if it is possible to take the course as a "Selected Topics Course" in their Department.

If you are working in industry and want to upskill in data science then you can take the courses (free of cost) and receive a certificate from the Department of Mathematics upon successful completion.

This course set is coordinated by [Raazesh Sainudiin](http://math.uu.se/research/raazesh-sainudiin/) at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University and a Data Science Consultant at [Combient AB](https://combient.com/) in Stockholm. 
If you are a PhD or MSc student at Uppsala University or a researcher who wants to upskill for the data industry and interested in registering for appropriate subsets of the course set then please email details/questions/etc to the course set coordinator with subject line `360-in-525-2019`. 

Physical presence is mandatory for the credits in all of these modules.


#### What is expected in a 1hp Course at Uppsala University?
Learning concepts in depth and familiarizing one self with new syntax requires completion of watching/reading assignments and completion of homework exercises. At Uppsala University, 1hp is about 25 hours of work and there is plenty of time, outside the 6-8 hours of face-to-face lab/lecture meetings, for deepening one's understanding.  

# [360-in-525-2019-1: Introduction to Privacy-Aware Decisions](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/360-in-525/2019/)
