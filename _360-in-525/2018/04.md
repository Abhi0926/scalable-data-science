This course was given in another form at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France for PhD students in mathematics there. Students in Geometry and Combinatorial probability as well as analysis may find this course insightful for their own research, as one of the basic theorems involves the combined use of several unique inequalities in a specific partial order of implications. The emphasis will involve constructive mathematics and perhaps delve into tree arithmetics towards such decision with universal performance guarantees along with their combinatorial, algebraic and analytic properties if time permits. Unfortunately such guarantees are not available for big data sets and may be necessary for being able to impose legal requirements and standards on automated decision-making systems.']

# [360-in-525-4: Mathematical, Statistical and Computational Foundations for Data Scientists](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/360-in-525/2018/04/)
 
Three-full-day workshops (3 hp) on **May 11, 18 and 25 2018**. Prerequisites: current proficiency in high-school level mathematics (pre-calculus, geometry and algebra with some programming experience beyond Excel). Target Audience: any MSc or PhD student at UU who wants to understand the mathematical statistical foundations in the data scientist's computational toolbox. The approach will use formal mathematical communication of concepts starting from sets and logic, but with concomitant development of computer programming skills to algorithmically construct and implement the concepts. Topics will include: Sets, Maps, Functions, Modular Arithmetic, Axiomatic Probability, Conditional probability, Pseudo-random constructive understanding of random variables and structures including graphs, Statistics, Likelihood Principle, Bayes Rule, Decisions (parametric and non-parametric) including tests and estimators, Markov chains and their pseudorandom constructions, etc. We will use [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) locally and collaborate in [COCALC](https://cocalc.com/) during the lab/lectures.

**Overview:**

This is a mathematically more careful (at an advanced undergraduate level) version of UC Berkeley's most popular freshman course:
 - [http://data8.org/](http://data8.org/) with the formula:
   - **computational thinking + inferential thinking  = data science** 
   - as talked about at the end [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggq7HiDO0OU).


**Prepare your laptop:** 

**SOFTWARE**: We will be using SageMath/Python ecosystem for the next three Fridays. 
Follow the download and installation instructions for your Operating System from the following URL:

- [http://www.sagemath.org/download.html](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html)

To test that you have installed correctly do the following:

- On a Mac OS X or Unix/Linux syatem, say you installed sage in a directory inside your home directory called `~/all/software/sage/`, then you can see if the following command launches a Jupyter notebook server successfully:

> $ ~/all/software/sage/SageMath/sage -n jupyter


- Those with Windows should follow the instructions in the following URL and test that the jupyter notebook server launches successfully:
  - [https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows](https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows)

# Course Content


**Download** the zip file of SageMath ipynb notebooks from:

 - [https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/_360-in-525/2018/04/jp/sageMathIpynbArchive](https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/_360-in-525/2018/04/jp/sageMathIpynbArchive)

After downloading the zip file, unzip it inside the directory you launched the sage jupyter notebook server from. You should be able to see all the jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks by navigating from your jupyter notebook server.
