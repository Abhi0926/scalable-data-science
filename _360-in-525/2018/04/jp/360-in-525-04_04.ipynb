    "When we introduced the subject of probability, we said that many famous people had become interested in it from the point of view of gambling.   Games of dice are one of the earliest forms of gambling (probably deriving from an even earlier game which involved throwing animal 'ankle' bones or astragali).   Galileo was one of those who wrote about dice, including an important piece which explained what many experienced gamblers had sensed but had not been able to formalise - the difference between the probability of throwing a 9 and the probability of throwing a 10 with two dice.  You should be able to see why this is from our map above.  If you are interested you can read a translation (Galileo wrote in Latin) of Galileo's Sorpa le Scoperte Dei Dadi.   This is also printed in a nice book, Games, Gods and Gambling by F.N. David (originally published 1962, newer editions now available).\n",
