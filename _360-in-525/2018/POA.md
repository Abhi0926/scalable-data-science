{: .notice--danger}


## 000 - LOGISTICS

- You can only physically be present at the course set if you have registered with Raazesh Sainudiin via email (registration deadline has passed for Spring 2018). You can join us online on HangOutsOnAir at [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJ5ALbDtuCA4DJmN3GvanA) channel or later on YouTube at [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_I1mOIPmfpZ6kq86w5ordoB7FY1Uj2ac) playlist.
- Join [https://www.meetup.com/Uppsala-Big-Data-Meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/Uppsala-Big-Data-Meetup/) (you may need to sign-up at [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) first and then join) for receiveing course logistics (for eg. each meeting is in a different room).
- Please RSVP via [Uppsala Big Data Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Uppsala-Big-Data-Meetup/) at least 3 days before the registered course event you will actually be able to attend. This is to order fika and ensure other infrastructures exist for you.
- Bring you wireless-enabled laptop with power chord for the lab-lectures.
- Sign-up for databricks community edition at [https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html).
 
<!---
	- set up Meetup (only allow people registers access to information)
	- get datbricks account and upload content for 360-in-525-01
	- check out how to give wireless access to people without UC wireless

<!---
This is a two-full-days workshop (2 hp) on May 3-4 2018. Prerequisites: 360-in-525-1 or Introduction to data Science. The first day will be done by domain experts from Uppsala University’s Department of Social and Economic Geography in order to introduce the basic problems and datasets of the field with hands-on lab tutorials in non-distributed geospatial analytics. The second day will be on distributed geospatial analytics over real datasets that can be scaled to petabytes (syllabus is jointly designed with experts in London’s big data industry). Topics include efficient distributed spatial joins, ingestion and representations of Open Street Maps that are conducive to pregel-style distributed vertex programs, SparkSQL and Spark Machine Learning pipelines with spatiotemporal GPS trajectories of multiple individuals.

## 360-in-525-4: Mathematical, Statistical and Computational Foundations for Data Scientists on **May 11 2018**

This is a mathematically more careful (at an advanced undergraduate level) version of UC Berkeley's most popular freshman course:
 - [http://data8.org/](http://data8.org/) with the formula:
   - **computatioal thinking + inferential thinking  = data science** 
   - as talked about at the end [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggq7HiDO0OU).

## 360-in-525-5: Population Genetics and Big Data (1 hp)  on **May 31 2018** 

**hp change:** *due to complicated scheduling issues 360-in-525-5 is now only 1hp for one full day. If you want to do it as a 2hp course then there may be possibilities for supervised projects on genome scale population demographic inference. Please talk to Raaz if you want to do a 2hp version.*
<!---
Two-full-day workshops (2 hp) on May 31 and June 1 2018. The first day will be on the basic theories in current population genetics and genomics. The second day will use ADAM and possibly Hail over Apache Spark. Prerequisite for May 31 is 360-in-525-4 or equivalent and for June 1 is 360-in-525-1 or Introduction to data Science. We will focus on Extract-Load-Transform operations and subsequent analysis for the 1000 genomes project.

## 360-in-525-0: Mathematical Statistical Learning Theory Series; An L1 View (1 hp) **June 1 2018**
<!---
  - Lecture Plan
    - Do a full day of X-lectures (and some explicit tree arithmetics if time permits) to understand the Theorems in [YatracosThis](http://lamastex.org/preprints/20180405_MDEYatracosThis.pdf) 
    - (Optionally, depending on audience C++ skills) dive from within docker into: [https://github.com/lamastex/mrs2/tree/master/companions/mrs-1.0-YatracosThis](https://github.com/lamastex/mrs2/tree/master/companions/mrs-1.0-YatracosThis) **Pre-Action:** Gloria needs to write a README on how to run the example on Table I in [YatracosThis](http://lamastex.org/preprints/20180405_MDEYatracosThis.pdf).
