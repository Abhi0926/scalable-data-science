- Join [https://www.meetup.com/Uppsala-Big-Data-Meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/Uppsala-Big-Data-Meetup/) (you may need to sign-up at [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) first and then join) for receiveing course logistics (for eg. each meeting is in a different room).
- Please RSVP via [Uppsala Big Data Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Uppsala-Big-Data-Meetup/) at least 3 days before the registered course event you will actually be able to attend. This is to order fika and ensure other infrastructures exist for you.
- Bring you wireless-enabled laptop with power chord for the lab-lectures.
- Sign-up for databricks community edition at [https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html).
