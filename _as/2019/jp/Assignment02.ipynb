    "### A Simple Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use the samplers we have made to do a very simple simulation.  Suppose the inter-arrival times, in minutes, of Orbiter buses at an Orbiter stop in Christchurch follows an $Exponential(\\lambda = 0.1)$ distribution.  Also suppose that this is quite a popular bus stop, and the arrival of people is very predictable:  one new person will arrive in each whole minute.  This means that the longer another bus takes in coming, the more people arrive to join the queue.  Also suppose that the number of free seats available on any bus follows a $de\\, Moivre(k=40)$ distribution, i.e, there are equally like to to be 1, or 2, or 3 ... or 40 spare seats.   If there are more spare seats than people in the queue, everyone can get onto the bus and  nobody is left waiting, but if there are not enough spare seats some people will be left waiting for the next bus.  As they wait, more people arrive to join the queue....\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not very realistic - we would want a better model for how many people arrive at the stop at least, and for the number of spare seats there will be on the bus.  However, we are just using this as a simple example that you can do using the random variables you already know how to simulate samples from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to code this example yourself, using our suggested steps.  We have put our version the code into a cell below, but you will get more out of this example by trying to do it yourself first.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggested steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get a list of 100 $Exponential(\\lambda = 0.1)$ samples using the `exponentialSamples` function.  Assign the list to a variable named something like `busTime`s.  These are your 100 simulated bus inter-arrival times.  \n",
    "- Choose a value for the number of people who will be waiting at the busstop when you start the simulation.  Call this something like `waiting`.  \n",
    "- Make a list called something like `leftWaiting`, which to begin with contains just the value assigned to `waiting`. \n",
    "- Make an empty list called something like `boardBus`.   \n",
    "- Start a for loop which takes each element in `busTimes` in turn, i.e. each bus inter-arrival time, and within the for loop:\n",
    "  - Calculate the number of people arriving at the stop as the floor of the time taken for that bus to arrive (i.e., one person for each whole minute until the bus arrives)\n",
    "  - Add this to the number of people waiting (e.g., if the number of arrivals is assigned to a variable arrivals, then waiting = waiting + arrivals will increment the value assigned to the waiting variable by the value of arrivals).\n",
    "  - Simulate a value for the number of seats available on the bus as one simulation from a $de \\, Moirve(k=40)$ RV (it may be easier to use `deMoivreFInverse` rather than `deMoivreSample` because you only need one value - remember that you will have to pass a simulated $u \\thicksim Uniform(0,1)$ to `deMoivreFInverse` as well as the value of the parameter $k$).\n",
    "  - The number of people who can get on the bus is the minimum of the number of people waiting in the queue and the number of seats on the bus.  Calculate this value and assign it to a variable called something like `getOnBus`.\n",
    "  - Append `getOnBus` to the list `boardBus`.\n",
    "  - Subtract `getOnBus` from the number of people waiting, waiting (e.g.,  `waiting = waiting - getOnBus` will decrement waiting by the number of people who get on the bus).\n",
    "  - Append the new value of `waiting` to the list `leftWaiting`. \n",
    "- That is the end of the for loop: you now have two lists, one for the number of people waiting at the stop and one for the number of people who can board each bus as it arrives."
