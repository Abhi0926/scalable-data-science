This course is designed by [Raazesh Sainudiin](http://math.uu.se/research/raazesh-sainudiin/), an Associate Professor in Mathematics with Specialisation in Data Science at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University and a Data Science Consultant at [Combient AB](https://combient.com/) in Stockholm. 

# COURSE

See [1MS926: Applied Statistics](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1MS926) for official details.
 
# OFFICIAL CONTENT

Statistical hypothesis testing (interpretation with confidence intervals, p-values), estimation methodology (ML and LS estimation), non-parametric methods, correlation analysis, multiple regression (estimation, prediction, diagnostics).

# ASSESSMENT
Written examination at the end of the course (4 credits) combined with assignments given during the course (1 hp).

**NOTE:** Written exam will be in the Computer Laboratory (you will write using keyboard and may also use pencil/paper) and assignments will prepare you for the exam. Attendance will be taken in the Computer Laboratory. See instructions below on how to submit assignments.

# Style

The approach will use formal mathematical communication of concepts with concomitant development of computer programs to cover the syllabus for [1MS926: Applied Statistics](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1MS926).
 
Lectures will build on: Sets, Maps, Functions, Modular Arithmetic, Axiomatic Probability, Conditional probability, constructive understanding of random variables and structures including graphs, Statistics, Likelihood Principle, Decisions (parametric and non-parametric) including hypothesis testing and estimation. Since the course is taught in English we will spend a bit more time revisiting Probability and Random Variables before covering hypothesis tests and estimations.

# Course Materials

**The first computer lab will show you how to do this!**

<!--

1. **Download** the SageMath `.ipynb` notebooks as well as `images` and `data` directories in the following `.zip` file:
  - <a href="https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/_as/2019/jp/sageMathIpynbArchive/as-2019.zip">https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/_as/2019/jp/sageMathIpynbArchive/as-2019.zip</a>
2. **Unzip** it into the directory you launched the sage jupyter notebook server from. 
3. You should be able to see all the jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks by navigating from your jupyter notebook server.
-->

**Individual SageMath Jupyter `.ipynb` Notebooks** *- add or replace with new or updated notebooks, as they become available* to cover target topics including correlation, linear regression and non/parametric hypothesis testing, etc.

# Assignments

Assignments will be graded.

## How to Submit Assignments?

**Four Steps to Submit Assignments as `.ipynb` SageMath Notebooks**

1. Place the `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebook in your course folder `as/jp/`:
  - so you can access `data/` directory inside `as/jp/` from the `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebook. 
  - Note that `x` in `Assignment0x.ipynb` will be `1`, `2` and `3` as the course progresses. 
  - You can download the `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebook from the link called "Download Assignment x" under heading **Download Assignment and Submit by Deadline**.
1. Follow the instructions in `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebook carefully starting from the first cell (including your *personal number*) and run `Test` cells to see if there are any errors you can fix before submitting it.
1. Save the completed `.ipynb` notebook from your Jupyter notebook server by Clicking "File > Download as > Notebook (.ipynb)".
1. Send an Email to your instructor's `math.uu.se` email address from your `uu.se` email address (NOT other email addresses!) as follows:
  - submit the completed and saved `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebook "as attachment" to the email
  - In the `Subject` field of the email write `1MS926 Assignment x`, where `x` is the `number` of the assignment, i.e. 1, 2 or 3.
  - Hit "Send".

**NOTE:** 
- Assignments will be considered unsubmitted if you do NOT *strictly adhere* to the above four Steps.
For example, do NOT send me emails from your non-`uu.se` addresses or have the wrong string in the `Subject` field.
- Late submissions will be noted to ensure fairness for the timeliness of all students. Assignments submitted after the due date will not be graded. You may resubmit your assignment up to three times and your highest scoring submission, i.e., best of up to three `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebooks will be used for your grade.

## Download Assignment and Submit by Deadline

1. Weeks 4--5: [Download Assignment 1](jp/Assignment01/)
  - Due Date to submit `Assignment01.ipynb` is Thursday February 07, 2019 at 1800 hours CET 

<!--
1. Weeks 6--7: **Assignment 2**
  - Due Date is Thursday February 07, 2019 at 1800 hours CET 
    - Submit `Assignment01.ipynb` 
-->

# Exam 

This exam will be in the computer lab and your will use the computer to take your exam, including submitting your answers. You are also expected use pencil/paper to do rough work on certain problems by hand before making the move into the computer. 
Thinking carefully about a complicated problem with pencil and paper first can often save a lot of time, especially when you use a computer! 

## Time and Place

Exam will be in computer labs Å 4102, Å 4103, Å 4104, Å 6K1107 in Ångström Laboratory from 0800-1300 hours on Thursday March 21 2019 ([ics](tt/1MS926-V19-Exam.ics) file).

## How to prepare for the exam

Doing all the 'YouTry's in the lab-lecture `00.ipynb`-`12.ipynb` notebooks *regularly* (ideally in the classroom along with your instructor) and doing the Assignments before the deadline is the best preparation for the exam.

It is highly likely that you may get a sample exam during your study period to help you prepare better for the exam.

Generally, one will NOT be able to miss all the lectures/labs, YouTrys, assignments and pass the course by "cramming" in the last few days.  This course is preparing you to think on your own from first principles. 

# Software

We will use [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) locally during face-to-face interactions. 

**Supplementary Book:**  
  * [Mathematical Computations with SageMath](http://lamastex.org/preprints/compSageMathZimmerman120517.pdf)

## Computer labs 

We have SageMath already installed for you in computer labs. Go to computer labs to access SageMath and to work on the assignments.
You will learn how to do download and work with the course materials in the form of `.ipynb` notebooks in the computer lab. 
It is strongly recommended that you also install SageMath in your laptop or desktop computer for convenience by following the instructions in the next section.

### Prepare your laptop on your own

It may be more convenient to install SageMath on your laptop or desktop.

- Follow the download and installation instructions for your Operating System from the following URL:
  - [http://www.sagemath.org/download.html](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html)
- To test that you have installed correctly do the following:

1. On a Mac OS X or Unix/Linux system, say you installed sage in a directory inside your home directory called `~/all/software/sage/`, then you can see if the following command launches a Jupyter notebook server successfully:

> $ ~/all/software/sage/SageMath/sage -n jupyter

2. Those with Windows should follow the instructions in the following URL and test that the jupyter notebook server launches successfully:
  - [https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows](https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows)
