This course is designed by [Raazesh Sainudiin](http://math.uu.se/research/raazesh-sainudiin/), an Associate Professor in Mathematics with Specialisation in Data Science at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University and a Data Science Consultant at [Combient AB](https://combient.com/) in Stockholm. 

# COURSE

See [1MS926: Applied Statistics](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1MS926) for official details.
 
# OFFICIAL CONTENT

Statistical hypothesis testing (interpretation with confidence intervals, p-values), estimation methodology (ML and LS estimation), non-parametric methods, correlation analysis, multiple regression (estimation, prediction, diagnostics).

# ASSESSMENT
Written examination at the end of the course (4 credits) combined with assignments given during the course (1 hp).

**NOTE:** Written exam will be in the Computer Laboratory (you will write using keyboard and may also use pencil/paper) and assignments will prepare you for the exam. Attendance will be taken in the Computer Laboratory. See instructions below on how to submit assignments.

# Style

The approach will use formal mathematical communication of concepts with concomitant development of computer programs to cover the syllabus for [1MS926: Applied Statistics](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1MS926).
 
Lectures will build on: Sets, Maps, Functions, Modular Arithmetic, Axiomatic Probability, Conditional probability, constructive understanding of random variables and structures including graphs, Statistics, Likelihood Principle, Decisions (parametric and non-parametric) including hypothesis testing and estimation. Since the course is taught in English we will spend a bit more time revisiting Probability and Random Variables before covering hypothesis tests and estimations.

# Course Materials

**The first computer lab will show you how to do this!**

1. **Download** the SageMath `.ipynb` notebooks as well as `images` and `data` directories in the following `.zip` file:
  - <a href="https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/_as/2019/jp/sageMathIpynbArchive/as-2019.zip">https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/_as/2019/jp/sageMathIpynbArchive/as-2019.zip</a>
2. **Unzip** it into the directory you launched the sage jupyter notebook server from. 
3. You should be able to see all the jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks by navigating from your jupyter notebook server.

**Individual SageMath Jupyter `.ipynb` Notebooks** *- add or replace with new or updated notebooks, as they become available* to cover target topics including correlation, linear regression and non/parametric hypothesis testing, etc. 

- [00. Introduction](jp/00/)
- [01. BASH Crash](jp/01/)
- [02. Numbers, Strings, Booleans and Sets](jp/02/)
- [03. Map, Function, Collection and Probability](jp/03/)
<!--
- [04. Conditional Probability, Random Variable, Loop and Conditional](jp/04/)

# Assignments

Assignments will be graded.

## How to Submit Assignments?

**Four Steps to Submit Assignments as `.ipynb` SageMath Notebooks**

1. Work through each cell, i.e., read the code and comments, evaluate the cell and understand the output of what you are doing, in the notebook 
2. Complete any *You Try*'s in the notebook
3. Save the completed `.ipynb` notebook from your Jupyter notebook server
4. Send an Email to your instructor's `math.uu.se` email address from your `uu.se` email address as follows:
  - attach the completed and saved `.ipynb` notebook(s) as attachment to the email
  - In the `Subject` field of the email write `1MS926:Assignment#x`, where `x` is the `number` of the assignment

**NOTE:** 
- Assignments will be considered unsubmitted if you do NOT *strictly adhere* to the above four Steps.
For example, do NOT send me emails from your non-`uu.se` addresses or have the wrong string in the `Subject` field.
- Late submissions will be noted to ensure fairness for the timeliness of all students.

# Software

We will use [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) locally during face-to-face interactions. 

**Supplementary Book:**  
  * [Mathematical Computations with SageMath](http://lamastex.org/preprints/compSageMathZimmerman120517.pdf)

## Computer labs 

We have SageMath already installed for you in computer labs. Go to computer labs to access SageMath and to work on the assignments.
You will learn how to do download and work with the course materials in the form of `.ipynb` notebooks in the computer lab. 
It is strongly recommended that you also install SageMath in your laptop or desktop computer for convenience by following the instructions in the next section.

### Prepare your laptop on your own

It may be more convenient to install SageMath on your laptop or desktop.

- Follow the download and installation instructions for your Operating System from the following URL:
  - [http://www.sagemath.org/download.html](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html)
- To test that you have installed correctly do the following:

1. On a Mac OS X or Unix/Linux system, say you installed sage in a directory inside your home directory called `~/all/software/sage/`, then you can see if the following command launches a Jupyter notebook server successfully:

> $ ~/all/software/sage/SageMath/sage -n jupyter

2. Those with Windows should follow the instructions in the following URL and test that the jupyter notebook server launches successfully:
  - [https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows](https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows)
