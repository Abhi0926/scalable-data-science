This directory is where the notebooks projected from dbc into sbt projects will be built (with extensions of App of with a main function done in sbt compatible IDEs like IntelliJ-IDEA and/or Eclipse-Scala-IDE).

They will be turned into .md files for rendering and documenting in `_sds/2/2/zp/`

This will only be done for a few example notebooks to show the idea of how one can do the same notebook code with IDE and thus submit directly to a local onpremise cluster or another public cloud.
