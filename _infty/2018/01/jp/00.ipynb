    "## What is SageMath and why are we using it?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Sage or [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) for our *hands-on* work in this course. Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL.  Sage can be used to study mathematics and statistics, including algebra, calculus, elementary to very advanced number theory, cryptography, commutative algebra, group theory, combinatorics, graph theory, exact linear algebra, optimization, interactive data visualization, randomized or Monte Carlo algorithms, scientific and statistical computing and much more. It combines various software packages into an integrative learning, teaching and research experience that is well suited for novice as well as professional researchers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Sage is a set of software libraries built on top of [Python](http://www.python.org/), a widely used general purpose programming language. Sage greatly enhance Python's already mathematically friendly nature. It is one of the languages used at Google, US National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA), US Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Industrial Light and Magic, YouTube, and other leading entities in industry and public sectors. Scientists, engineers, and mathematicians often find it well suited for their work. Obtain a more thorough rationale for Sage from <a href=\"http://www.sagemath.org/library/why.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why Sage?</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sagemath.org/library/stories.html\" target=\"_blank\">Success Stories, Testimonials and News Articles</a>.
