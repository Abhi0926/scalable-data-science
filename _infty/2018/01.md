This course set is coordinated by Dr. Raazesh Sainudiin, a [Researcher in Applied Mathematics and Statistics](http://math.uu.se/research/raazesh-sainudiin/) at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University and a Data Science Consultant at [Combient AB](https://combient.com/) in Stockholm. 

# OFFICIAL CONTENT

Critical review of how statistics are presented and interpreted. General about statistical studies. Basic theory of point and interval estimations and hypothesis test. Correlation and regression. Parametric methods. Statistical software.

See [1MS035: Inferensteori I](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/freestanding-courses/course-syllabus/?kpid=27407&kKod=1MS035) for more details.

# Style

The approach will use formal mathematical communication of concepts with concomitant development of computer programs to cover the syllabus for [1MS035: Inferensteori I](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/freestanding-courses/course-syllabus/?kpid=27407&kKod=1MS035).
 
Lectures will build on: Sets, Maps, Functions, Modular Arithmetic, Axiomatic Probability, Conditional probability, constructive understanding of random variables and structures including graphs, Statistics, Likelihood Principle, Bayes Rule, Decisions (parametric and non-parametric) including hypothesis testing and estimation. 

# Software

We will use [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) locally during face-to-face interactions. You may also collaborate in [COCALC](https://cocalc.com/) remotely. All needed programming basics will be introduced as needed.

### Supplementary Book:  
  * [Mathematical Computations with SageMath](http://lamastex.org/preprints/compSageMathZimmerman120517.pdf)

### Prepare your laptop 

- Follow the download and installation instructions for your Operating System from the following URL:
  - [http://www.sagemath.org/download.html](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html)
- To test that you have installed correctly do the following:

1. On a Mac OS X or Unix/Linux syatem, say you installed sage in a directory inside your home directory called `~/all/software/sage/`, then you can see if the following command launches a Jupyter notebook server successfully:

> $ ~/all/software/sage/SageMath/sage -n jupyter

2. Those with Windows should follow the instructions in the following URL and test that the jupyter notebook server launches successfully:
  - [https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows](https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows)

# Course Materials

**Download** the SageMath ipynb notebooks as they become available from:

**Individual SageMath Jupyter `.ipynb` Notebooks**

- [00. Introduction](jp/00/)
- [01. Introduction](jp/01/)
- [02. Introduction](jp/02/)
- [03. Introduction](jp/03/)


After downloading it into the directory you launched the sage jupyter notebook server from. You should be able to see all the jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks by navigating from your jupyter notebook server.

This is the GitHub directory containing the SageMath contents for the course:

-  [https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/\_infty/2018/01/jp/](https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/\_infty/2018/01/jp/)

### Course Structure

I would like to customize the course for you! So would prefer to do the content week-by-week dynamically based on interactions and feedback. 

However, if you want to have *some idea* of the structure for the course then take a look at Chapters 1-9, 11-14, 17-18 in one of my books under progress:

- [https://github.com/lamastex/computational-statistical-experiments/raw/master/matlab/csebook/CSEBook.pdf](https://github.com/lamastex/computational-statistical-experiments/raw/master/matlab/csebook/CSEBook.pdf)

**A Global Background and Context:**

This is a mathematically more mature variant of UC Berkeley's most popular freshman course that is aimed at covering the Syllabus for Uppsala's Inference Theory 1:

 - [http://data8.org/](http://data8.org/) with the formula:
   - **computational thinking + inferential thinking  = data science** 
   - as talked about at the end [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggq7HiDO0OU).
