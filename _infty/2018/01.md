This course set is coordinated by Dr. Raazesh Sainudiin, a [Researcher in Applied Mathematics and Statistics](http://math.uu.se/research/raazesh-sainudiin/) at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University and a Data Science Consultant at [Combient AB](https://combient.com/) in Stockholm. 

# OFFICIAL CONTENT

Critical review of how statistics are presented and interpreted. General about statistical studies. Basic theory of point and interval estimations and hypothesis test. Correlation and regression. Parametric methods. Statistical software.

See [1MS035: Inferensteori I](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/freestanding-courses/course-syllabus/?kpid=27407&kKod=1MS035) for more details.

# Style

The approach will use formal mathematical communication of concepts with concomitant development of computer programs to cover the syllabus for [1MS035: Inferensteori I](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/freestanding-courses/course-syllabus/?kpid=27407&kKod=1MS035).
 
Lectures will build on: Sets, Maps, Functions, Modular Arithmetic, Axiomatic Probability, Conditional probability, constructive understanding of random variables and structures including graphs, Statistics, Likelihood Principle, Bayes Rule, Decisions (parametric and non-parametric) including hypothesis testing and estimation. 

# Course Materials

1. **Download** the SageMath `.ipynb` notebooks as well as `images` and `data` directories in the following `.zip` file:
  - <a href="https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/_infty/2018/01/jp/sageMathIpynbArchive/infty-2018-01.zip">https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/_infty/2018/01/jp/sageMathIpynbArchive/infty-2018-01.zip</a>
2. **Unzip** it into the directory you launched the sage jupyter notebook server from. 
3. You should be able to see all the jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks by navigating from your jupyter notebook server.

**Individual SageMath Jupyter `.ipynb` Notebooks** *- replace with these possibly updated notebooks, in case newer content is added*

## Course Structure

I would like to customize the course for you! So would prefer to do the content week-by-week dynamically based on interactions and feedback. 

However, if you want to have *some idea* of the structure for the course and complete some assigned exercises then take a look at Chapters 1-9, 11-14, 17-18 in *CSEBook.pdf*, one of my books under progress:

- Download *CSEBook.pdf* from [https://github.com/lamastex/computational-statistical-experiments/raw/master/matlab/csebook/CSEBook.pdf](https://github.com/lamastex/computational-statistical-experiments/raw/master/matlab/csebook/CSEBook.pdf)

**A Global Background and Context:**

This is a mathematically more mature variant of UC Berkeley's most popular freshman course that is aimed at covering the Syllabus for Uppsala's Inference Theory 1:

 - [http://data8.org/](http://data8.org/) with the formula:
   - **computational thinking + inferential thinking  = data science** 
   - as talked about at the end [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggq7HiDO0OU).

# Assigned Exercises

**Important Submission Steps** How to submit computer exercises in `.ipynb` SageMath notebooks?

1. Work through each cell, i.e., read the code and comments, evaluate the cell and understand the output of what you are doing, in the notebook 
2. Complete any *You Try*'s in the notebook
3. Save the completed `.ipynb` notebook from your Jupyter notebook server
4. Send an Email to your instructor's `math.uu.se` email address from your `uu.se` email address as follows:
  - attach the completed and saved `.ipynb` notebook(s) as attachment to the email
  - In the `Subject` field of the email write `1MS035:Assignment#x`, where `x` is the `number` of the assignment

**NOTE:** 
- Assignments will be considered unsubmitted if you do NOT *strictly adhere* to the above four Steps.
For example, do NOT send me emails from your non-`uu.se` addresses or have the wrong string in the `Subject:` field!
- Late submissions will be noted to ensure fairness for the timeliness of all students.

## Computer Exercises

1. Weeks 1--3: **Assignment#1**
  - Due Date is Monday November 19, 2018 at 1159 hours CET (announced in class on November 09, 2018)
    - Submit `.ipynb` notebooks: [00](jp/00/), [01](jp/01/), [02](jp/02/) and [03](jp/03/).

## Hand-written Exercises

Generally, such exercises should be tried by yourself or with your mates. They need not be submitted. You can ask about them in class if you are stuck interpreting or solving them. These exercises are invaluable to pass the final exam of the course.

1. Weeks 1--3: Review of Probability and Introduction to Point Estimators
  - Do Exercises in *CSEBook.pdf*: Ex. 6.11, 6.12, 6.14, 6.16, 6.17, 6.18, 6.19  in Chapter 6, pages 129-130. 
  - Give a *proof of the LLN* that was required in the complete proof of the claim that *(asymptotic) consistency of the estimator given by the sample mean of the product Bernoulli experiment "follows" from the (Weak) Law of Large Numbers or LLN*.
  - More problems will be assigned during black-board lectures.

# Software

We will use [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) locally during face-to-face interactions. You may also collaborate in [COCALC](https://cocalc.com/) remotely. All needed programming basics will be introduced as needed.

### Supplementary Book:  
  * [Mathematical Computations with SageMath](http://lamastex.org/preprints/compSageMathZimmerman120517.pdf)

### Prepare your laptop 

- Follow the download and installation instructions for your Operating System from the following URL:
  - [http://www.sagemath.org/download.html](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html)
- To test that you have installed correctly do the following:

1. On a Mac OS X or Unix/Linux syatem, say you installed sage in a directory inside your home directory called `~/all/software/sage/`, then you can see if the following command launches a Jupyter notebook server successfully:

> $ ~/all/software/sage/SageMath/sage -n jupyter

2. Those with Windows should follow the instructions in the following URL and test that the jupyter notebook server launches successfully:
