This course set is coordinated by Dr. Raazesh Sainudiin, a [Researcher in Applied Mathematics and Statistics](http://math.uu.se/research/raazesh-sainudiin/) at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University and a Data Science Consultant at [Combient AB](https://combient.com/) in Stockholm. 

# CONTENT

Critical review of how statistics are presented and interpreted. General about statistical studies. Basic theory of point and interval estimations and hypothesis test. Correlation and regression. Parametric methods. Statistical software.

# Style

The approach will use formal mathematical communication of concepts with concomitant development of computer programs to cover the syllabus for [1MS035: Inferensteori I](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/freestanding-courses/course-syllabus/?kpid=27407&kKod=1MS035).
 
Lectures will build on: Sets, Maps, Functions, Modular Arithmetic, Axiomatic Probability, Conditional probability, constructive understanding of random variables and structures including graphs, Statistics, Likelihood Principle, Bayes Rule, Decisions (parametric and non-parametric) including hypothesis testing and estimation. 

# Software

We will use [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) locally during face-to-face interactions. You may also collaborate in [COCALC](https://cocalc.com/) remotely. All needed programming basics will be introduced as needed.
