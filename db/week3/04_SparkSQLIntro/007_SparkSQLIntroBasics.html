this:\n```scala\n// An existing SparkContext\nval sc: SparkContext = ...\nval sqlContext = new org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext(sc)\n\n// This is used to implicitly convert an RDD to a DataFrame (see examples below)\nimport sqlContext.implicits._\n```\n\nNote that SQLContext in notebook is actually HiveContext. The difference is that HiveContext provides richer functionality over standard SQLContext, e.g. window functions were only available with HiveContext up to Spark 1.5.2, or usage of Hive user-defined functions. This originates from the fact that Spark SQL parser was built based on HiveQL parser, so only HiveContext was supporting full HiveQL syntax. Now it is changing, and SQLContext supports most of the functionality of the descendant (window functions should be available in SQLContext in 1.6+).\n\n> Note that you do not need Hive installation when working with SQLContext or HiveContext, Spark comes with built-in derby datastore.","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"startTime":0.0,"submitTime":0.0,"finishTime":0.0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"nuid":"8260e565-a257-4809-935c-f04b82c9369a"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":50737,"guid":"3d0fb3bd-f5cf-47ac-a315-4ab3ab7f699e","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":0.99267578125,"command":"%md\n## Creating DataFrames\n\nWith a [`SQLContext`](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext), applications can create [`DataFrame`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame) \n* from an existing `RDD`, \n* from a Hive table, or \n* from various other data sources.\n\n#### Just to recap: \n* A DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. \n* You can think of it as being organized into table RDD of case class `Row` (which is not exactly true). \n* DataFrames, in comparison to RDDs, are backed by rich optimizations, including:\n  * tracking their own schema, \n  * adaptive query execution, \n  * code generation including whole stage codegen, \n  * extensible Catalyst optimizer, and \n  * project [Tungsten](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/28/project-tungsten-bringing-spark-closer-to-bare-metal.html). \n\n> Note that performance for DataFrames is the same across languages Scala, Java, Python, and R.

detail can see:\n* [video lectures in Module 3 of Anthony Joseph's Introduction to Big Data edX course](/#workspace/scalable-data-science/xtraResources/edXBigDataSeries2015/CS100-1x/Module 3:

.dbc archive of this 2016 instance of the scalable-data-science course - remarked (you should really see the 2016 version of Anthony Joseph + Ameet Talwarkar + Jon Bates edX course now... and Spark 2.0 will be another story I am sure...). \n\nAnthony Joseph's Introduction to Big Data edX course (in python using pySpark) has been added to this databricks shard at:\n* [Workspace ->
