I endeavoured to prevent it, I said, pray don't pick my pocket; they said, they would, and \n               &lt;persName id=&quot;t17930109-1-person53&quot;&gt;\n                  Sophia\n                   Langford\n               &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person53&quot;

I made my escape on to the other side of the way, they followed me, Langford kept the box, and she came and struck me again, and put her hand into my pocket the second time, and she struck me over the head; they took nothing more out of my pocket, but rattled the box over my head; I applied to a waterman that was there; I don't know his name; but I did not take them up till Thursday, they were then taken up by the two patroles, I was with them, I found them up almost by Temple-bar; I am sure they are the same women perfectly; there was a light near where I was robbed; I never recovered the box with the powder, it might be the value of another shilling; I was alone at the time, but the next witness saw the transaction, he joined me.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Prisoner Langford. On Wednesday evening, I do not recollect being out at any such an hour. - I am sure that is the woman, she took the box away from me and struck me.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Prisoner Townsend. I never recollect seeing the woman before Thursday night. - That is the woman I am perfectly sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Court.

On Wednesday evening the girl called on me, and told me she had been robbed; I asked her, if she knew the people? She said, she should; I recommended her to go the following night and speak to the constables and patroles, and take them up; I went with her, she saw the prisoners coming rather behind Temple-bar, towards Arundell-street in the Strand, she knew the prisoners and said, there are the two women that robbed me; when they came up the patrole took them to the watch-house, and the girl there charged them with having robbed her and having struck her, once on the Somerset house side of the Strand, and afterwards following her on the other side and striking her again; the prisoners both declared they had never seen the prosecutrix in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n            \n                  &lt;persName id=&quot;t17930109-1-person56&quot;&gt;\n                  ROBERT\n                   NOAKES\n               &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person56&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; value=&quot;NOAKES&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person56&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; value=&quot;ROBERT&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person56&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; value=&quot;male&quot;/&gt;\n                  &lt;/persName&gt;\n             sworn.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;I am a patrole belonging to St. Clement's; I knew nothing of this till Thursday night between seven and eight o'clock, I took \n               &lt;persName id=&quot;t17930109-1-person57&quot;&gt;\n                  Sophia\n                   Langford\n               &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person57&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; value=&quot;Langford&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person57&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; value=&quot;Sophia&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person57&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; value=&quot;female&quot;/&gt;\n                  &lt;/persName&gt;\n            , and the other patrole with me took the other, and we took them to St. Clement's-lane watch-house, and then told them what it was for, the prosecutrix came there and laid the charge against them.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n            \n                  &lt;persName id=&quot;t17930109-1-person58&quot;&gt;\n                  GEORGE\n                   SALLIS\n               &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person58&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; value=&quot;SALLIS&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person58&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; value=&quot;GEORGE&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person58&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; value=&quot;male&quot;/&gt;\n                  &lt;/persName&gt;\n             sworn.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;I am a patrole; I assisted the other in taking them up.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n            \n                  &lt;persName id=&quot;t17930109-1-person59&quot;&gt;\n                  JAMES\n                   TALBOYS\n               &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person59&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; value=&quot;TALBOYS&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person59&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; value=&quot;JAMES&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person59&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; value=&quot;male&quot;/&gt;\n                  &lt;/persName&gt;\n             sworn.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;I am beadle and watch-house keeper to the parish of St. Clement's; these girls were brought to the watch-house on Thursday about half after nine or not quite so much, the young woman told me that them two women had robbed her the night before, she said, she was robbed of a little box of medicines and a shilling in silver, and that she had been ill treated, they declared they never saw&lt;xptr type=&quot;pageFacsimile&quot; doc=&quot;179301090005&quot;/&gt;her in their lives before; I searched the prisoners but found nothing relating to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Court to Prosecutrix.

I did not see him take them; but before he came in there were handkerchiefs there; I am sure they were there at the time they came in; the handkerchiefs were close to the glass so as to be seen on the outside; as soon as ever they were gone I missed the handkerchiefs. The other boy said, he had no more than a shilling, and then they both ran away; I looked at the window directly and I found the handkerchiefs gone; I immediately pursued them; I saw which way they went, they turned to the left and went up Market-lane; I ran after them into the market, and I saw Crawley throw the handkerchiefs from under his coat under a dark window, when I was not three yards from him.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Q.

Was there any body else came in? - There was a woman came in before the boys went out, she stood at the same counter further on in the shop, she&lt;xptr type=&quot;pageFacsimile&quot; doc=&quot;179301090006&quot;/&gt;bought a pair of stockings but not of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;(The handkerchiefs produced and deposed to.)&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Prisoner.

I was coming from Westminster; I keep my brother's house and work at my needle; they then asked me for a pocket handkerchief, and then Townsend put her right hand down my bosom, and her left hand into my left hand pocket, and Langford put her hand into my right hand pocket and took out a small box containing some medicine powder in it and a shilling;

I made my escape on to the other side of the way, they followed me, Langford kept the box, and she came and struck me again, and put her hand into my pocket the second time, and she struck me over the head; they took nothing more out of my pocket, but rattled the box over my head; I applied to a waterman that was there; I don't know his name; but I did not take them up till Thursday, they were then taken up by the two patroles, I was with them, I found them up almost by Temple-bar; I am sure they are the same women perfectly; there was a light near where I was robbed; I never recovered the box with the powder, it might be the value of another shilling; I was alone at the time, but the next witness saw the transaction, he joined me.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Prisoner Langford. On Wednesday evening, I do not recollect being out at any such an hour. - I am sure that is the woman, she took the box away from me and struck me.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Prisoner Townsend.

When you found them on Thursday did you find them together? - I did, both walking together.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n            \n                  &lt;persName id=&quot;t17930109-1-person54&quot;&gt;\n                  EDWARD\n                   CLARKE\n               &lt;interp value=&quot;CLARKE&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person54&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp value=&quot;EDWARD&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person54&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp value=&quot;male&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person54&quot;/&gt;\n                  &lt;/persName&gt;\n             sworn.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;I am a hair dresser by business, but I follow the brokery at present with my uncle; I had been on a message to old Round-court in the Strand, returning from thence I saw the prisoners at the bar insult the prosecutor; I am certain they are the same, they put their hands into her bosom and into her pockets, the one I think that did it was she in the dark own, Langford, the other, was standing by; Langford, she took something&lt;xptr doc=&quot;179301090004&quot; type=&quot;pageFacsimile&quot;/&gt;from her, but what I cannot tell, she put her hand down her bosom and in her pockets, the girl was making a terrible piece of work at the time, and turning herself round very quick, Langford she had something in her hand which she shaked over the last witness's head, they called her some infamous names, Townsend called her a bloody sow, and they said, if ever she came that way again they would cut her head open or off, I cannot tell which, this was after they had taken it, and desired her to go about her business, and Langford beat her about the head; on the girl's running away, I went up to her and asked her what was the matter; she told me, she had lost a small box containing some medicines, the women then had left her; I did not see the other woman do any thing at the time the box was taken, she might have done something, but I did not see it; I desired her to stop and I would go to the prisoners and ask them for the box; I followed them to Southampton-street, Covent-garden, I asked them to return the box, and that Langford called me that bloody slanger, or said, I was the bloody slanger that belonged to the bloody whore, and if I did not make the best of my way she would cut my bloody head open; with that I made the best of my way from them to look for a watchman, but I could not find a watchman or patrole for some time, when I got a watchman I went back again and they were gone, and I returned home; I am positive they are the same persons.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Prisoner Langford. I never saw the woman till she brought the person on Thursday, when I was detained till the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Clarke.

On Wednesday evening the girl called on me, and told me she had been robbed; I asked her, if she knew the people? She said, she should; I recommended her to go the following night and speak to the constables and patroles, and take them up; I went with her, she saw the prisoners coming rather behind Temple-bar, towards Arundell-street in the Strand, she knew the prisoners and said, there are the two women that robbed me; when they came up the patrole took them to the watch-house, and the girl there charged them with having robbed her and having struck her, once on the Somerset house side of the Strand, and afterwards following her on the other side and striking her again; the prisoners both declared they had never seen the prosecutrix in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n            \n                  &lt;persName id=&quot;t17930109-1-person56&quot;&gt;\n                  ROBERT\n                   NOAKES\n               &lt;interp value=&quot;NOAKES&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person56&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp value=&quot;ROBERT&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person56&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp value=&quot;male&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person56&quot;/&gt;\n                  &lt;/persName&gt;\n             sworn.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;I am a patrole belonging to St. Clement's; I knew nothing of this till Thursday night between seven and eight o'clock, I took \n               &lt;persName id=&quot;t17930109-1-person57&quot;&gt;\n                  Sophia\n                   Langford\n               &lt;interp value=&quot;Langford&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person57&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp value=&quot;Sophia&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person57&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp value=&quot;female&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person57&quot;/&gt;\n                  &lt;/persName&gt;\n            , and the other patrole with me took the other, and we took them to St. Clement's-lane watch-house, and then told them what it was for, the prosecutrix came there and laid the charge against them.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n            \n                  &lt;persName id=&quot;t17930109-1-person58&quot;&gt;\n                  GEORGE\n                   SALLIS\n               &lt;interp value=&quot;SALLIS&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person58&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp value=&quot;GEORGE&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person58&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp value=&quot;male&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person58&quot;/&gt;\n                  &lt;/persName&gt;\n             sworn.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;I am a patrole; I assisted the other in taking them up.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;\n            \n                  &lt;persName id=&quot;t17930109-1-person59&quot;&gt;\n                  JAMES\n                   TALBOYS\n               &lt;interp value=&quot;TALBOYS&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person59&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp value=&quot;JAMES&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person59&quot;/&gt;\n                     &lt;interp value=&quot;male&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; inst=&quot;t17930109-1-person59&quot;/&gt;\n                  &lt;/persName&gt;\n             sworn.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;I am beadle and watch-house keeper to the parish of St. Clement's; these girls were brought to the watch-house on Thursday about half after nine or not quite so much, the young woman told me that them two women had robbed her the night before, she said, she was robbed of a little box of medicines and a shilling in silver, and that she had been ill treated, they declared they never saw&lt;xptr doc=&quot;179301090005&quot; type=&quot;pageFacsimile&quot;/&gt;her in their lives before; I searched the prisoners but found nothing relating to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Court to Prosecutrix.

I did not see him take them; but before he came in there were handkerchiefs there; I am sure they were there at the time they came in; the handkerchiefs were close to the glass so as to be seen on the outside; as soon as ever they were gone I missed the handkerchiefs. The other boy said, he had no more than a shilling, and then they both ran away; I looked at the window directly and I found the handkerchiefs gone; I immediately pursued them; I saw which way they went, they turned to the left and went up Market-lane; I ran after them into the market, and I saw Crawley throw the handkerchiefs from under his coat under a dark window, when I was not three yards from him.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Q. Could you see what he threw down? - No, I went and picked up what he threw down and laid hold of him; they were my handkerchiefs, and the person was the prisoner Crawley: I am quite sure that the boy I laid hold of in the street was the same boy who was in the shop by the window.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Q. If I understand you right you did not see him take the handkerchiefs, but you knew they were there when he came in, and you missed them immediately as he went out? - It was so.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Q. Was there any body else came in? - There was a woman came in before the boys went out, she stood at the same counter further on in the shop, she&lt;xptr doc=&quot;179301090006&quot; type=&quot;pageFacsimile&quot;/&gt;bought a pair of stockings but not of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;(The handkerchiefs produced and deposed to.)&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Prisoner.

they took nothing more out of my pocket, but rattled the box over my head; I applied to a waterman that was there; I don't know his name; but I did not take them up till Thursday, they were then taken up by the two patroles, I was with them, I found them up almost by Temple-bar; I am sure they are the same women perfectly; there was a light near where I was robbed; I never recovered the box with the powder, it might be the value of another shilling; I was alone at the time, but the next witness saw the transaction, he joined me.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Prisoner Langford.

I did not see him take them; but before he came in there were handkerchiefs there; I am sure they were there at the time they came in; the handkerchiefs were close to the glass so as to be seen on the outside; as soon as ever they were gone I missed the handkerchiefs. The other boy said, he had no more than a shilling, and then they both ran away; I looked at the window directly and I found the handkerchiefs gone; I immediately pursued them; I saw which way they went, they turned to the left and went up Market-lane; I ran after them into the market, and I saw Crawley throw the handkerchiefs from under his coat under a dark window, when I was not three yards from him.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Q.

I made my escape on to the other side of the way, they followed me, Langford kept the box, and she came and struck me again, and put her hand into my pocket the second time, and she struck me over the head; they took nothing more out of my pocket, but rattled the box over my head; I applied to a waterman that was there; I don't know his name; but I did not take them up till Thursday, they were then taken up by the two patroles, I was with them, I found them up almost by Temple-bar; I am sure they are the same women perfectly; there was a light near where I was robbed; I never recovered the box with the powder, it might be the value of another shilling; I was alone at the time, but the next witness saw the transaction, he joined me.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Prisoner Langford.

I did not see him take them; but before he came in there were handkerchiefs there; I am sure they were there at the time they came in; the handkerchiefs were close to the glass so as to be seen on the outside; as soon as ever they were gone I missed the handkerchiefs. The other boy said, he had no more than a shilling, and then they both ran away; I looked at the window directly and I found the handkerchiefs gone; I immediately pursued them; I saw which way they went, they turned to the left and went up Market-lane; I ran after them into the market, and I saw Crawley throw the handkerchiefs from under his coat under a dark window, when I was not three yards from him.&lt;/p&gt;\n               &lt;p&gt;Q.

praying for him, recovering his Senses a little, he comply'd with the Worship, and as I was going away he express'd his gratitude, by praying God to bless me twice or thrice, not being able to speak any more; and the same Night at Midnight, after he had praised God by singing Psalms, and making Responses in the Devotion, as in a recommendatory Prayer for him they were praying the Lord Jesus to receive his Soul, and at these Words (as I was told) he gave up the Ghost, being Thursday the 21st of October.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          I instructed them from Col. 2. 6. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him. From which Text I took occasion to explain to them the necessity of Faith in Christ, which must not be a dead Faith, but attended with good Works, bringing forth manifold Fruits unto new obedience, Holyness and Virtue, not consisting in empty speculative Notions, as some seem to explain it, but affecting the heart with Heavenly divine Thoughts, truly becoming God and Religion, and making reformation upon the whole Man, so that he becomes wholly a new Creature, Holy in Heart and Life, dedicating himself without Reserve, Soul and Body, unto the Service of God. From Acts, 3, 19. Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; they were taught the nature of true Repentance, which consisteth partly in an hearty unfeign'd Sorrow for Sin, not because of the Inconveniences and Calamities it brings upon us; but because of the Offence thereby given to Almighty God, in whom it is we live, move, and from whom we have all our Being, who is daily loading us with his Benefits, and preventing us with his Blessings; and therefore should we be grieved because we have offended our good and gracious God, such a tender, loving, and indulgent Father: But I show'd 'em that true Repentance mainly consisted in forsaking all Sin without exception, especially those Sins which are more heinous in the sight of God than others, and for which Men void of Virtue and goodness commonly come to Shame and Disgrace;\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;xptr doc=&quot;OA172611030002&quot; type=&quot;pageFacsimile&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          and as by Repentance they must forsake Sin, so as to loath, detest and abhor themselves in Dust and Ashes because of it; and told them, that they must turn to God with all their Heart, whereas formerly they had been the Servants of Sin unto Unrighteousness, henceforth they must become the obedient Servants of Righteousness unto Holiness, approving 'emselves with Consciences void of Offence towards God and towards Man; and resolving by the Grace of God, if they had been to continue any longer in this World, to become new Creatures, having their Conversation in Heaven, looking unto Jesus the Author and finisher of our Faith, &amp;amp;c. They were also instructed in the nature of the Christian Sacraments; and how greatly they had been guilty of breaking their baptismal Vows, particularly, in committing those heinous Sins, of robbing other Men of their Goods and Properties, which now brought them into much Shame, and loaded 'em with many Sorrows and anguish of Mind: I exhorted them to prepare for receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, as a Pledge and assurance of their coming to everlasting Life, if they sincerely repented of all their Sins, believing in our Lord Jesus Christ their only Saviour; and from these Words, St. Luke 22. 19.

Altho' he was not bred to any Employment, yet he said, that he understood\n          &lt;rs type=&quot;occupation&quot; id=&quot;OA17261103-occupation-8&quot;&gt;Bricklaying&lt;/rs&gt;\n          &lt;join \n          targets=&quot;OA17261103n12-1 OA17261103-occupation-8&quot; targOrder=&quot;Y&quot; result=&quot;persNameOccupation&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/join&gt;\n          ; and that a certain Gentleman inform'd him in a Secret of curing Smoaky Chimneys, by which Practice he gain'd Considerable; and this was the Reason why he commonly past under the Nick-name of the Chimney Smoaky Doctor. He said that his Father left an Estate of one or two hundred pounds a Year to him, but the Truth of this may be doubted, since none of his Acquaintance who came to Visit him knew of any such Estate; but own'd that he liv'd in very good Credit, and that he was capable to make very considerable Profits of\n          &lt;rs type=&quot;occupation&quot; id=&quot;OA17261103-occupation-9&quot;&gt;curing Chimneys&lt;/rs&gt;\n          &lt;join \n          targets=&quot;OA17261103n12-1 OA17261103-occupation-9&quot; targOrder=&quot;Y&quot; result=&quot;persNameOccupation&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/join&gt;\n          from Smoaking, which was his Profession, and in doing whereof he was very dexterous. Some few Years ago, he married a Widow Gentlewoman at\n          &lt;placeName id=&quot;OA17261103-geo-10&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;urban_centre&quot; type=&quot;type&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103-geo-10&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;join \n            targets=&quot;OA17261103n12-1 OA17261103-geo-10&quot; targOrder=&quot;Y&quot; result=&quot;persNamePlace&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/join&gt;\n            Oxford\n          &lt;/placeName&gt;\n          , who had an Estate and Money, to the value of fifteen hundred Pounds, as is commonly reported by them who know him; but he said, that all the Fortune he got by her did not exceed 500 l. He said, that till this Misfortune for which he Died, his Credit and Honesty was never doubted, he living in as good a Character, as most Men in his Neighbourhood did. He appear'd to be a young Man of indifferent good Understanding, and of a pliable, civil Temper. In Chappel he seem'd always very Devout in Prayer, and attentive to what Exhortations were given them, and when I saw him in his Room, he was still employ'd in reading upon some Book of Devotion, having had the use of some few little Books very proper for his perusal, in order to prepare him for Death, while he was under Sentence. Both before and after the Report was made, he us'd all possible Means for obtaining a Reprieve, the Thoughts of which, mightily disturb'd and distracted his Mind in preparing for Eternity; and altho' Intercession was made by Men of eminent Note, yet his Crime was look'd upon to be so Heinous, that no Favour could be obtain'd that way; and then two days before his Death, he began to give over all Thoughts of Life, and to be more serious in preparing for Eternity; and to think upon receiving the Sacrament, which was accordingly Administred to him by a Rev. Clergyman, who was so good as to Visit him, and the rest of them sometimes, during their miserable Confinement; and before the Sacrament was given him, he gave a free Declaration of his Faith, and that he was in Peace, and Friendship with all Mankind. For he had frequently made grievous Complaints upon his Wife, calling her unnatural and cruel to him, in neither visiting nor writing to him in the Day of his extreme Calamity. He did indeed write to her himself, as did some others upon his desire, most earnestly desiring her to come to Town, and confer with him about some Affairs before his Death, and to see if she with the assistance of a Gentleman, whom he desir'd to come up with her, could do any thing in order to obtain a Reprieve. This he most earnestly urg'd upon her to do, but she sent no Answer to him; only the Gentleman whom he desir'd to come along with her, sent a Letter to him, making excuse both for Mrs. Drury's, and his own not coming to Town; that she was extremely Lame, and her Servant being gone could not put on her own Cloaths; that she had no Money o bear her Expences in such a Journey, much less to supply him in his Distress; and that it was no ways in her Power to do any thing for him: And as for the Gentleman himself, he said, that ever since he was in Town last attending him, he had been very much indispos'd of a violent Cold, contracted while he was at London, doing what he could for him, and all to no purpose, and going into the Country in a hurry about his own necessary Affairs. Mr. Drury among other Motives to induce his Wife to come to Town, desir'd her not to neglect to do it, that she might redeem some silver Plate which he had Pawn'd here in Town, for 24 l. to relieve himself in his pressing Necessities when in Prison at\n          &lt;placeName id=&quot;OA17261103-geo-11&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;site&quot; type=&quot;type&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103-geo-11&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;join \n            targets=&quot;OA17261103n12-1 OA17261103-geo-11&quot; targOrder=&quot;Y&quot; result=&quot;persNamePlace&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/join&gt;\n            Newgate\n          &lt;/placeName&gt;\n          , altho' the Plate was worth more than double the Sum which was lent upon it. This Argument had no more force than the rest, she answering by her Friend's Letter, that if any Man would relieve the Plate, she would re-pay him, and gratify him sufficiently for his Trouble. Mr. Drury concluded that his Wife was not willing he should Live, but, as he said, he frankly and from his Heart forgave her. As to the Crime for which he Suffer'd, he said, that he never was a wicked Liver, but had follow'd his Business in an honest way, in working about Chimneys up and down the Country, which he found beneficial; altho' his Wife thinking it Dishonourable and Reproachful, did what she could to persuade and hinder him from following it. He complain'd indeed, that his Marriage being unequal as to Age, was an uncomfortable State of Life to him, his Wife having been of a fretful uneasie Temper, and perpetually Jealous of him without any just Cause.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          He said, that he never was, nor never intended to be a Robber or a Highway-man, and that he was never guilty of Theft, excepting the particular Fact for which he died; which (as he alledg'd) if he had not been advis'd, encourag'd, and very frequently press'd upon by another to commit, had never been done by him. The Person who advis'd him (as he said) was\n          &lt;persName id=&quot;OA17261103n14-1&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;male&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103n14-1&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;King&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103n14-1&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;Robert&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103n14-1&quot;/&gt;\n            Robert King\n          &lt;/persName&gt;\n          the\n          &lt;rs type=&quot;occupation&quot; id=&quot;OA17261103-occupation-10&quot;&gt;Waggoner&lt;/rs&gt;\n          &lt;join \n          targets=&quot;OA17261103n14-1 OA17261103-occupation-10&quot; targOrder=&quot;Y&quot; result=&quot;persNameOccupation&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/join&gt;\n          , who was to have the one half of the Booty, whatever it happen'd to be; and who some Weeks before he rob'd the Waggon, at several times, and in different Places, most earnestly, and in an urgent Manner, Counsell'd him to Rob his Waggon, as it was going from\n          &lt;placeName id=&quot;OA17261103-geo-12&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;urban_centre&quot; type=&quot;type&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103-geo-12&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;join \n            targets=&quot;OA17261103n12-1 n14-1 OA17261103-geo-12&quot; targOrder=&quot;Y&quot; result=&quot;persNamePlace&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/join&gt;\n            Bistter\n          &lt;/placeName&gt;\n          to\n          &lt;placeName id=&quot;OA17261103-geo-13&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;urban_centre&quot; type=&quot;type&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103-geo-13&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;join \n            targets=&quot;OA17261103n12-1 n14-1 OA17261103-geo-13&quot; targOrder=&quot;Y&quot; result=&quot;persNamePlace&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/join&gt;\n            London\n          &lt;/placeName&gt;\n          ; which he said, You may do it with the greatest Ease immaginable, for no manner of Opposition shall be made, yea, you\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;xptr doc=&quot;OA172611030004&quot; type=&quot;pageFacsimile&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          shall be rather encourag'd and forewarded in your Attempt. Otherways he said, excepting these importunate Solicitations of Mr. King, he had no Temptation to betake himself to the Highway, being capable to Live upon what he and his Wife had, and what he could make by his own Business like a Gentleman in the Country. A Gentlewoman who waited on Mr. Drury two or three Days, when he was first under Sentence, said, That as she was going out in a Chaise with Mr. Drury from\n          &lt;placeName id=&quot;OA17261103-geo-14&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;urban_centre&quot; type=&quot;type&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103-geo-14&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;join \n            targets=&quot;OA17261103n12-1 OA17261103-geo-14&quot; targOrder=&quot;Y&quot; result=&quot;persNamePlace&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/join&gt;\n            London\n          &lt;/placeName&gt;\n          to\n          &lt;placeName id=&quot;OA17261103-geo-15&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;join \n            targets=&quot;OA17261103n12-1 OA17261103-geo-15&quot; targOrder=&quot;Y&quot; result=&quot;persNamePlace&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/join&gt;\n            Wendover\n          &lt;/placeName&gt;\n          , the Waggoner met them, and desir'd Mr. Drury to come out for he wanted to speak with him; they going off from the Chaise at a good distance; the Gentlewoman could not hear what particulars they spoke upon; only she heard the Waggoner say, That he need not be afraid, and that he was sure to get what he wanted; or to that Purpose.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          But the Gentlewoman knowing nothing of their Communication at that Time could make no Judgment of the Words she heard pass between 'em. Strange it is indeed, that Mr. Drury should have rob'd a Waggon where so many People were concern'd, other Waggons also being in Company, and going the same way, without the least Opposition being offer'd him. The Day before his Death, he still reflected upon his Wife's Cruelty, and Brutishness, (as he call'd it) in not sending Money, or coming to him, being to leave the World so suddenly; who (added he) altho' he had been one of the most wicked Men ever was, yet she could not deny him to be her Husband, and as such, he conceiv'd that she was bound in Duty to wait upon and Assist him. I told him, however undutiful his Wife was, yet as a dying Man he should not entertain in his Mind, or show the least Resentment against her, especially in consideration of the heinous Crime he had committed, having thereby Disgrac'd not only himself, but also his Wife and Family: This he acknowledg'd, and appearing a little Easie, he declar'd that as a dying Man, and expected Mercy from God, he freely forgave all Injuries done him. The Evening before he Suffer'd, a Woman came to Mr. Drurey's Room-door in the Prison, and beg'd the favour to speak a word to him, he went to his Chamber-door; the Woman expressing her Sorrow to see him in that Condition; said, That she was desir'd by a certain Person to whom she had been Servant, to be informed by him, What he had to say about the Waggoner? Mr. Drurey reply'd, That the Thoughts of robbing Waggons or any Thing else, never enter'd into his Head, till the Waggoner advis'd, and frequently urg'd him to do it; and that his Blood, the loss of his Life, and all he had in this World lay upon him. I exhorted him to give over all Thoughts of Life, and to think seriously upon Death, for he still entertain'd thoughts of a Reprieve, by the Interest of a Man of Quality, till his Time drawing near; he said, that he submitted to the Will of God, who had justly chastis'd him for his Faults: I frequently advis'd him to try and search his Heart impartially, how it was dispos'd towards God, and Heavenly Things, to which he had been so much a Stranger; a manifest Instance of his Covetousness, appearing by his committing such a notorious Crime, as Robbing on the Highway. I desir'd him to Repent of all his Sins, particularly the notorious and scandalous Villainly for which he Died; not casting the blame upon any Person, but only his own wicked Heart and vicious Inclinations, not pretending Innocence in any respect. He own'd himself to've been a great Sinner, but not a Slave to any particular Vice; that he never was much guilty of Drinking to Excess; that he had been much addicted to Whoring; that he was truly Penitent for all his Offences, believing in Jesus Christ his only Saviour, thro' whose Merits he only expected his Sins to be Expiated, and his Soul to be Saved in the great Day of the Lord; declaring himself in Peace with all the World, and that he Died in Communion with this Church, of which he own'd himself an unworthy Member.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;At the Place of Execution.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;\n          &lt;persName id=&quot;OA17261103n18-1&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;male&quot; type=&quot;gender&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103n18-1&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;DRUREY&quot; type=&quot;surname&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103n18-1&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;ANTHONY&quot; type=&quot;given&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103n18-1&quot;/&gt;\n            ANTHONY DRUREY\n          &lt;/persName&gt;\n          , appear'd with abundance of Courage, as if he had not been much concern'd, and no ways afraid. Being ask'd if he had any thing to add to his former Confessions? He began and spoke a good while, the Substance of his Discourse was, That King the Waggoner was the only Person who put him upon and advis'd him to Rob the Waggon; and that he advis'd him also to Rob the Banbury Waggon, and his own Wife of 4 l. but that he got only 2 or 3 s. from her; he call'd King a very wicked Man, and pray'd God to forgive him, and bring him to a Sense of his Sin. He complain'd of his Wife's Unkindness, whom he also forgave, praying to God for her. At Newgate Prison before he went to Execution, a Man said, that he had married one Mr. Nichols's Daughter in the City of\n          &lt;placeName id=&quot;OA17261103-geo-16&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;interp value=&quot;urban_centre&quot; type=&quot;type&quot; inst=&quot;OA17261103-geo-16&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;join \n            targets=&quot;OA17261103n18-1 OA17261103-geo-16&quot; targOrder=&quot;Y&quot; result=&quot;persNamePlace&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/join&gt;\n            Norwich\n          &lt;/placeName&gt;\n          , who is Sister to the said Man's Wife, and whom he left 7 Years ago, having married another Wife since. Being at the Place of Execution, I ask'd him about his multiplicity of Wives? he wav'd a positive Answer, saying, That he was loaded with many Reproaches by numbers of People, whom he heartily forgave. And calling to a Gentleman who was at the Place of Execution, he gave some private Directions relating to the Settlement of his Estate which he had before made. He gave several Advices to the Spectators to live Virtuous and godly Lives; and he hop'd to be Sav'd thro' the merits of Jesus Christ, and died apparently Penitent.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n
