Scalable Data Science
=======

Scalable data science is a technical course in the area of Big Data, aimed at the needs of the emerging data industry in Christchurch and those of certain academic domain experts across University of Canterbury's Colleges, including, Arts, Science and Engineering. This course uses Apache Spark, a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing via databricks to compute with datasets that won't fit in a single computer. The course will introduce Sparkâ€™s core concepts via hands-on coding, including resilient distributed datasets and map-reduce algorithms, data frames and Spark SQL on catalyst, scalable machine-learning pipelines in MLlib and vertex programs using the distributed graph processing framework of graphX. We will solve instances of real-world big data decision problems from various scientific domains.

This is being prepared by Raazesh Sainudiin and Sivanand Sivaram 
with assistance from Paul Brouwers and Dillon George.

All course participants (enrolled and observing students for Semester 1 of 2016) may be able to do a course project if their project proposal gets approved by Raazesh Sainudiin, the course coordinator.
