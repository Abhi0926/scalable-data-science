Scalable Data Science
=======

Scalable data science is a technical course in the area of Big Data, aimed at the needs of the emerging data industry in Christchurch and those of certain academic domain experts across University of Canterbury's Colleges, including, Arts, Science and Engineering. This course uses Apache Spark, a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing via databricks to compute with datasets that won't fit in a single computer. The course will introduce Sparkâ€™s core concepts via hands-on coding, including resilient distributed datasets and map-reduce algorithms, data frames and spark SQL on catalyst, and vertex programs using the distributed graph processing framework of graphX. We will solve instances of real-world big data decision problems from various scientific domains.

To quickly learn about the computing platform read an introduction to Apache Spark. The course will cover topics from the first 8 of 9 Must-Have Skills to Land Top Big Data Jobs in 2015 and prepare the student to take the spark-certified-developer exams that are available online.

Minimal prerequisites include some experience in python programming (COSC121) and knowledge of 200 level linear algebra (MATH203) and 100 level calculus with probability (MATH103). Additional courses in Mathematics, Statistics or Computer Science will be helpful.
