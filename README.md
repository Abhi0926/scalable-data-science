Scalable Data Science
=======

Scalable data science is a technical course in the area of Big Data, aimed at the needs of the
emerging data industry in Christchurch and those of certain academic domain experts across
University of Canterbury's Colleges, including, Arts, Science and Engineering. This course uses
Apache Spark, a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing via databricks to compute
with datasets that won't fit in a single computer. The course will introduce Sparkâ€™s core concepts
via hands-on coding, including resilient distributed datasets and map-reduce algorithms, DataFrame
and Spark SQL on Catalyst, scalable machine-learning pipelines in MlLib and vertex programs using
the distributed graph processing framework of GraphX. We will solve instances of real-world big data
decision problems from various scientific domains.

This is being prepared by Raazesh Sainudiin and Sivanand Sivaram
with assistance from Paul Brouwers, Dillon George and Ivan Sadikov.
