This course is designed by [Raazesh Sainudiin](http://math.uu.se/research/raazesh-sainudiin/), an Associate Professor in Mathematics with Specialisation in Data Science at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University and Consulting Principal Data Scientist at [Combient AB](https://combient.com/) in Stockholm. 

# COURSE

The course will provide *an* **in***troduction to Data Science* simultaneously from a computational, mathematical and statistical perspective. 

# Style

The approach will use formal mathematical communication of concepts with concomitant development of computer programs.
 
Lectures will build on: Sets, Maps, Functions, Modular Arithmetic, Axiomatic Probability, Conditional probability, constructive understanding of random variables and structures including graphs, Statistics, Likelihood Principle, Decisions (parametric and non-parametric) including hypothesis testing and estimation. 

Everyone should get something from this course and it is meant to help one prototype in the most active open-source mathematically consistent ecosystem based around Python.

# Course Materials

**The first computer lab will show you how to do this!**

<!--

1. **Download** the SageMath `.ipynb` notebooks as well as `images` and `data` directories in the following `.zip` file:
  - <a href="https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/_as/2019/jp/sageMathIpynbArchive/as-2019.zip">https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/_as/2019/jp/sageMathIpynbArchive/as-2019.zip</a>
2. **Unzip** it into the directory you launched the sage jupyter notebook server from. 
3. You should be able to see all the jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks by navigating from your jupyter notebook server.
-->

**Individual SageMath Jupyter `.ipynb` Notebooks** *- add or replace with new or updated notebooks, as they become available* to cover target topics including correlation, linear regression and non/parametric hypothesis testing, etc. 

Roughly one notebook will be covered per lecture (we have a total of 12 lectures; some of which can go faster).

We will break regularly for exercises as assignments for maximum retention and immediate brain-muscle memory on your operating systems.

# Assignments for Exercising between Lectures

Assignments will be tried in between lab-lectures regulary:

- first try on your own, 
- start cooperating with your course-mates to learn/co-learn/trach, 
- the solutions will be displayed only after a good amount of time is devoted to solving the assigned exercises. 

<!--
## How to Submit Assignments?

**Four Steps to Submit Assignments as `.ipynb` SageMath Notebooks**

1. Place the `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebook in your course folder `as/jp/`:
  - so you can access `data/` directory inside `as/jp/` from the `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebook. 
  - Note that `x` in `Assignment0x.ipynb` will be `1`, `2` and `3` as the course progresses. 
  - You can download the `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebook from the link called "Download Assignment x" under heading **Download Assignment and Submit by Deadline**.
1. Follow the instructions in `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebook carefully starting from the first cell (including your *personal number*) and run `Test` cells to see if there are any errors you can fix before submitting it.
1. Save the completed `.ipynb` notebook from your Jupyter notebook server by Clicking "File > Download as > Notebook (.ipynb)".
1. Send an Email to your instructor's specified email address from your identifiable professional email address (NOT arbitrary  email addresses!) as follows:
  - submit the completed and saved `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebook "as attachment" to the email
  - In the `Subject` field of the email write `sds-2-x-in Assignment x`, where `x` is the `number` of the assignment, i.e. 1, 2 or 3.
  - Hit "Send".

**NOTE:** 
- Assignments will be considered unsubmitted if you do NOT *strictly adhere* to the above four Steps.
For example, do NOT send me emails from your non-`uu.se` addresses or have the wrong string in the `Subject` field.
- Late submissions will be noted to ensure fairness for the timeliness of all students. Assignments submitted after the due date will not be graded. You may resubmit your assignment up to three times and your highest scoring submission, i.e., best of up to three `Assignment0x.ipynb` notebooks will be used for your grade.

# Assignments

1. [Download Assignment 1](jp/Assignment01/)
1. [Download Assignment 2](jp/Assignment02/)
1. [Download Assignment 3](jp/Assignment03/) 


# Software

We will use [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) locally during face-to-face interactions. 

**Supplementary Book:**  
  * [Mathematical Computations with SageMath](http://lamastex.org/preprints/compSageMathZimmerman120517.pdf)

## Computer labs 

We have SageMath already installed for you in computer labs. Go to computer labs to access SageMath and to work on the assignments.
You will learn how to do download and work with the course materials in the form of `.ipynb` notebooks in the computer lab. 
It is strongly recommended that you also install SageMath in your laptop or desktop computer for convenience by following the instructions in the next section.

### Prepare your laptop on your own

It may be more convenient to install SageMath on your laptop or desktop.

- Follow the download and installation instructions for your Operating System from the following URL:
  - [http://www.sagemath.org/download.html](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html)
- To test that you have installed correctly do the following:

1. On a Mac OS X or Unix/Linux system, say you installed sage in a directory inside your home directory called `~/all/software/sage/`, then you can see if the following command launches a Jupyter notebook server successfully:

> $ ~/all/software/sage/SageMath/sage -n jupyter

2. Those with Windows should follow the instructions in the following URL and test that the jupyter notebook server launches successfully:
  - [https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows](https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows)
  - [Support for 64-bit Windows 7 exists](https://opendreamkit.org/2017/10/11/SageWindows/)

3. As a backup, get a free account in [cocalc.com](cocalc.com), for collaborative calculation in the cloud.
