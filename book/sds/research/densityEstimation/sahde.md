## Project SAHDE:<br /> Scalable Adaptive Histogram Density Estimation 

This programme is partly supported by:

* [databricks academic partners program](https://academics.cloud.databricks.com) (for distributed cloud computing
* research time for this project was party due to:
	* 2009-2015 by industrial consulting revenues of Raazesh Sainudiin
	* 2015, 2016 by the project [CORCON: Correctness by Construction](http://corcon.net/about/), Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union, Marie Curie Actions-People, International Research Staff Exchange Scheme with counter-part funding by The Royal Society of New Zealand 

Project SAHDE is an effort to create a scalable version of the adaptive histogram density estimators implemented in:
* [MRS 2.0, a C++ class library for statistical set processing and computer-aided proofs in statistics](https://github.com/raazesh-sainudiin/mrs2).

based on mathematical statistical notions in:
* Data-adaptive histograms through statistical regular pavings, Raazesh Sainudiin, Gloria Teng, Jennifer Harlow and Warwick Tucker, 2016 ([PDF](http://lamastex.org/preprints/20161121optMAPMDE.pdf) 1.8MB)
