Topic Modeling of Movie Dialogs with Latent Dirichlet Allocation
================================================================

### Let us cluster the conversations from different movies!

This notebook will provide a brief algorithm summary, links for further reading, and an example of how to use LDA for Topic Modeling.

**not tested in Spark 2.2 yet (see 034 notebook for syntactic issues, if any)**

Also read the methodological and more formal papers cited in the above links if you want to know more.

Let's get a bird's eye view of LDA from <https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf> next.

-   See pictures (hopefully you read the paper last night!)
-   Algorithm of the generative model (this is unsupervised clustering)
-   For a careful introduction to the topic see Section 27.3 and 27.4 (pages 950-970) pf Murphy's *Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, MIT Press, 2012*.
-   We will be quite application focussed or applied here!

Probabilistic Topic Modeling Example
------------------------------------

This is an outline of our Topic Modeling workflow. Feel free to jump to any subtopic to find out more. - Step 0. Dataset Review - Step 1. Downloading and Loading Data into DBFS - (Step 1. only needs to be done once per shard - see details at the end of the notebook for Step 1.) - Step 2. Loading the Data and Data Cleaning - Step 3. Text Tokenization - Step 4. Remove Stopwords - Step 5. Vector of Token Counts - Step 6. Create LDA model with Online Variational Bayes - Step 7. Review Topics - Step 8. Model Tuning - Refilter Stopwords - Step 9. Create LDA model with Expectation Maximization - Step 10. Visualize Results

Step 0. Dataset Review
----------------------

In this example, we will use the [Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html).

Here is the `README.txt`: *** *** Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus

Distributed together with:

"Chameleons in imagined conversations: A new approach to understanding coordination of linguistic style in dialogs" Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee Proceedings of the Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics, ACL 2011.

(this paper is included in this zip file)

NOTE: If you have results to report on these corpora, please send email to cristian@cs.cornell.edu or llee@cs.cornell.edu so we can add you to our list of people using this data. Thanks!

1.  Brief description:

This corpus contains a metadata-rich collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts:

-   220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters
-   involves 9,035 characters from 617 movies
-   in total 304,713 utterances
-   movie metadata included: - genres - release year - IMDB rating - number of IMDB votes - IMDB rating
-   character metadata included: - gender (for 3,774 characters) - position on movie credits (3,321 characters)

1.  Files description:

In all files the field separator is " +++$+++ "

-   movie\_titles\_metadata.txt - contains information about each movie title - fields: - movieID, - movie title, - movie year, - IMDB rating, - no. IMDB votes, - genres in the format \['genre1','genre2',...,'genreN'\]

-   movie\_characters\_metadata.txt - contains information about each movie character - fields: - characterID - character name - movieID - movie title - gender ("?" for unlabeled cases) - position in credits ("?" for unlabeled cases)

-   movie\_lines.txt - contains the actual text of each utterance - fields: - lineID - characterID (who uttered this phrase) - movieID - character name - text of the utterance

-   movie\_conversations.txt - the structure of the conversations - fields - characterID of the first character involved in the conversation - characterID of the second character involved in the conversation - movieID of the movie in which the conversation occurred - list of the utterances that make the conversation, in chronological order: \['lineID1','lineID2',...,'lineIDN'\] has to be matched with movie\_lines.txt to reconstruct the actual content

-   raw\_script\_urls.txt - the urls from which the raw sources were retrieved

1.  Details on the collection procedure:

We started from raw publicly available movie scripts (sources acknowledged in raw\_script\_urls.txt). In order to collect the metadata necessary for this study and to distinguish between two script versions of the same movie, we automatically matched each script with an entry in movie database provided by IMDB (The Internet Movie Database; data interfaces available at http://www.imdb.com/interfaces). Some amount of manual correction was also involved. When more than one movie with the same title was found in IMBD, the match was made with the most popular title (the one that received most IMDB votes)

After discarding all movies that could not be matched or that had less than 5 IMDB votes, we were left with 617 unique titles with metadata including genre, release year, IMDB rating and no. of IMDB votes and cast distribution. We then identified the pairs of characters that interact and separated their conversations automatically using simple data processing heuristics. After discarding all pairs that exchanged less than 5 conversational exchanges there were 10,292 left, exchanging 220,579 conversational exchanges (304,713 utterances). After automatically matching the names of the 9,035 involved characters to the list of cast distribution, we used the gender of each interpreting actor to infer the fictional gender of a subset of 3,321 movie characters (we raised the number of gendered 3,774 characters through manual annotation). Similarly, we collected the end credit position of a subset of 3,321 characters as a proxy for their status.

Step 2. Loading the Data and Data Cleaning
------------------------------------------

We have already used the wget command to download the file, and put it in our distributed file system (this process takes about 1 minute). To repeat these steps or to download data from another source follow the steps at the bottom of this worksheet on **Step 1. Downloading and Loading Data into DBFS**.

Let's make sure these files are in dbfs now:

    // this is where the data resides in dbfs (see below to download it first, if you go to a new shard!)

Let's amalgamate the texts utered in the same conversations together.

By doing this we loose all the information in the order of utterance.

But this is fine as we are going to do LDA with just the *first-order information of words uttered in each conversation* by anyone involved in the dialogue.

    val corpusDF = convLines.groupBy($"conversationID",$"movieID")
      .agg(concat_ws(" :-()-: ",collect_list($"text")).alias("corpus"))
      .join(moviesMetaData, "movieID") // and join it to get movie meta data
      .select($"conversationID".as("id"),$"corpus",$"movieTitle",$"movieYear")

If you'll only tell me about it. :-()-: I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | lost horizon | 1937 |
| 17593.0 | You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water? :-()-: It's unbelievable. :-()-: Think of it! In times like these. :-()-: Say, what about that gold deal? :-()-: Huh? :-()-: Gold. You were going to� :-()-: Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long.

| 17610.0 | That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them? :-()-: Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . . :-()-: �buy and sell? :-()-: Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange . :-()-: I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start? :-()-: That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man. :-()-: Who? :-()-: A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault. :-()-: When was all this? :-()-: Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself. :-()-: He amputated his own leg? :-()-: Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation. :-()-: Well, they didn't actually mean that. :-()-: Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here. :-()-: Well, is it? :-()-: Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg? :-()-: 108 and still active? :-()-: You're startled? :-()-: Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all. :-()-: Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?" :-()-: Very often. :-()-: And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide. :-()-: That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course. :-()-: Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me! :-()-: I surprise you? Now that's news. :-()-: I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it? :-()-: Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course. :-()-: Then everything is quite all right, isn't it? | lost horizon | 1937 |

But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway. :-()-: Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | lost horizon | 1937 |

| 17633.0 | That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here. :-()-: That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea? :-()-: Sondra Bizet. :-()-: Oh, the girl at the piano? :-()-: Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all. :-()-: Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community? :-()-: We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on. :-()-: But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on. :-()-: We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.                                                                                            | lost horizon | 1937 |

Feature extraction and transformation APIs
------------------------------------------

We will use the convenient [Feature extraction and transformation APIs](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html).

Step 3. Text Tokenization
-------------------------

We will use the RegexTokenizer to split each document into tokens. We can setMinTokenLength() here to indicate a minimum token length, and filter away all tokens that fall below the minimum. See: \* <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#tokenizer>.

    import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.RegexTokenizer

    // Set params for RegexTokenizer
    val tokenizer = new RegexTokenizer()
    .setPattern("[\\W_]+") // break by white space character(s)
    .setMinTokenLength(4) // Filter away tokens with length < 4
    .setInputCol("corpus") // name of the input column
    .setOutputCol("tokens") // name of the output column

    // Tokenize document
    val tokenized_df = tokenizer.transform(corpusDF)

> import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.RegexTokenizer tokenizer: org.apache.spark.ml.feature.RegexTokenizer = regexTok\_610667693de3 tokenized\_df: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = \[id: bigint, corpus: string, movieTitle: string, movieYear: string, tokens: array&lt;string&gt;\]

    display(tokenized_df.sample(false,0.001,1234L)) 

    display(tokenized_df.sample(false,0.001,1234L).select("tokens"))

Step 4. Remove Stopwords
------------------------

We can easily remove stopwords using the StopWordsRemover(). See: \* <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#stopwordsremover>.

If a list of stopwords is not provided, the StopWordsRemover() will use [this list of stopwords](http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/linguistic_utils/stop_words), also shown below, by default.

``` a,about,above,across,after,afterwards,again,against,all,almost,alone,along,already,also,although,always,am,among,amongst,amoungst,amount,an,and,another,any,anyhow,anyone,anything,anyway,anywhere,

```

You can use `getStopWords()` to see the list of stopwords that will be used.

In this example, we will specify a list of stopwords for the StopWordsRemover() to use. We do this so that we can add on to the list later on.

    display(dbutils.fs.ls("dbfs:/tmp/stopwords")) // check if the file already exists from earlier wget and dbfs-load

| dbfs:/tmp/stopwords | stopwords | 2237.0 |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|

If the file `dbfs:/tmp/stopwords` already exists then skip the next two cells, otherwise download and load it into DBFS by uncommenting and evaluating the next two cells.

    //%sh wget http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/linguistic_utils/stop_words -O /tmp/stopwords # uncomment '//' at the beginning and repeat only if needed again

    val stopwords = sc.textFile("/tmp/stopwords").collect()

    stopwords.length // find the number of stopwords in the scala Array[String]

> res23: Int = 319

Finally, we can just remove the stopwords using the `StopWordsRemover` as follows:

    import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.StopWordsRemover

    // Set params for StopWordsRemover
    val remover = new StopWordsRemover()
    .setStopWords(stopwords) // This parameter is optional
    .setInputCol("tokens")
    .setOutputCol("filtered")

    // Create new DF with Stopwords removed
    val filtered_df = remover.transform(tokenized_df)

> import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.StopWordsRemover remover: org.apache.spark.ml.feature.StopWordsRemover = stopWords\_bcdc59bf2ac8 filtered\_df: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = \[id: bigint, corpus: string, movieTitle: string, movieYear: string, tokens: array&lt;string&gt;, filtered: array&lt;string&gt;\]

Step 5. Vector of Token Counts
------------------------------

LDA takes in a vector of token counts as input. We can use the `CountVectorizer()` to easily convert our text documents into vectors of token counts.

The `CountVectorizer` will return `(VocabSize, Array(Indexed Tokens), Array(Token Frequency))`.

Two handy parameters to note: - `setMinDF`: Specifies the minimum number of different documents a term must appear in to be included in the vocabulary. - `setMinTF`: Specifies the minimum number of times a term has to appear in a document to be included in the vocabulary.

See: \* <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#countvectorizer>.

    import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.CountVectorizer

    // Set params for CountVectorizer
    val vectorizer = new CountVectorizer()
    .setInputCol("filtered")
    .setOutputCol("features")
    .setVocabSize(10000) 
    .setMinDF(5) // the minimum number of different documents a term must appear in to be included in the vocabulary.
    .fit(filtered_df)

> import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.CountVectorizer vectorizer: org.apache.spark.ml.feature.CountVectorizerModel = cntVec\_daa8106c510f

    // Create vector of token counts
    val countVectors = vectorizer.transform(filtered_df).select("id", "features")

> countVectors: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = \[id: bigint, features: vector\]

    // see the first countVectors
    countVectors.take(1)

> res24: Array\[org.apache.spark.sql.Row\] = Array(\[17668,(10000,\[0,9,32,33,37,45,56,63,71,79,124,235,293,1562,1660,1899\],\[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0\])\])

To use the LDA algorithm in the MLlib library, we have to convert the DataFrame back into an RDD.

    // Convert DF to RDD
    import org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Vector

    val lda_countVector = countVectors.map { case Row(id: Long, countVector: Vector) => (id, countVector) }

> import org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Vector lda\_countVector: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD\[(Long, org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Vector)\] = MapPartitionsRDD\[305\] at map at &lt;console&gt;:86

    // format: Array(id, (VocabSize, Array(indexedTokens), Array(Token Frequency)))
    lda_countVector.take(1)

> res25: Array\[(Long, org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Vector)\] = Array((17668,(10000,\[0,9,32,33,37,45,56,63,71,79,124,235,293,1562,1660,1899\],\[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0\])))

Let's get an overview of LDA in Spark's MLLIB
---------------------------------------------

See: \* <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-clustering.html#latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda>.

Create LDA model with Online Variational Bayes
----------------------------------------------

We will now set the parameters for LDA. We will use the OnlineLDAOptimizer() here, which implements Online Variational Bayes.

Choosing the number of topics for your LDA model requires a bit of domain knowledge. As we do not know the number of "topics", we will set numTopics to be 20.

    val numTopics = 20

> numTopics: Int = 20

We will set the parameters needed to build our LDA model. We can also setMiniBatchFraction for the OnlineLDAOptimizer, which sets the fraction of corpus sampled and used at each iteration. In this example, we will set this to 0.8.

    import org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.{LDA, OnlineLDAOptimizer}

    // Set LDA params
    val lda = new LDA()
    .setOptimizer(new OnlineLDAOptimizer().setMiniBatchFraction(0.8))
    .setK(numTopics)
    .setMaxIterations(3)
    .setDocConcentration(-1) // use default values
    .setTopicConcentration(-1) // use default values

> import org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.{LDA, OnlineLDAOptimizer} lda: org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.LDA = org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.LDA@1d493912

Create the LDA model with Online Variational Bayes.

    val ldaModel = lda.run(lda_countVector)

> ldaModel: org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.LDAModel = org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.LocalLDAModel@3945c264

Also see the paper on *Online varioational Bayes* by Matt linked for more details (from the above URL): <http://videolectures.net/site/normal_dl/tag=83534/nips2010_1291.pdf>

Note that using the OnlineLDAOptimizer returns us a [LocalLDAModel](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.LocalLDAModel), which stores the inferred topics of your corpus.

Review Topics
-------------

We can now review the results of our LDA model. We will print out all 20 topics with their corresponding term probabilities.

Note that you will get slightly different results every time you run an LDA model since LDA includes some randomization.

Going through the results, you may notice that some of the topic words returned are actually stopwords that are specific to our dataset (for eg: "writes", "article"...). Let's try improving our model.

Step 8. Model Tuning - Refilter Stopwords
-----------------------------------------

We will try to improve the results of our model by identifying some stopwords that are specific to our dataset. We will filter these stopwords out and rerun our LDA model to see if we get better results.

    val add_stopwords = Array("whatever") // add  more stop-words like the name of your company!

> add\_stopwords: Array\[String\] = Array(whatever)

    // Combine newly identified stopwords to our exising list of stopwords
    val new_stopwords = stopwords.union(add_stopwords)

> new\_stopwords: Array\[String\] = Array(a, about, above, across, after, afterwards, again, against, all, almost, alone, along, already, also, although, always, am, among, amongst, amoungst, amount, an, and, another, any, anyhow, anyone, anything, anyway, anywhere, are, around, as, at, back, be, became, because, become, becomes, becoming, been, before, beforehand, behind, being, below, beside, besides, between, beyond, bill, both, bottom, but, by, call, can, cannot, cant, co, computer, con, could, couldnt, cry, de, describe, detail, do, done, down, due, during, each, eg, eight, either, eleven, else, elsewhere, empty, enough, etc, even, ever, every, everyone, everything, everywhere, except, few, fifteen, fify, fill, find, fire, first, five, for, former, formerly, forty, found, four, from, front, full, further, get, give, go, had, has, hasnt, have, he, hence, her, here, hereafter, hereby, herein, hereupon, hers, herself, him, himself, his, how, however, hundred, i, ie, if, in, inc, indeed, interest, into, is, it, its, itself, keep, last, latter, latterly, least, less, ltd, made, many, may, me, meanwhile, might, mill, mine, more, moreover, most, mostly, move, much, must, my, myself, name, namely, neither, never, nevertheless, next, nine, no, nobody, none, noone, nor, not, nothing, now, nowhere, of, off, often, on, once, one, only, onto, or, other, others, otherwise, our, ours, ourselves, out, over, own, part, per, perhaps, please, put, rather, re, same, see, seem, seemed, seeming, seems, serious, several, she, should, show, side, since, sincere, six, sixty, so, some, somehow, someone, something, sometime, sometimes, somewhere, still, such, system, take, ten, than, that, the, their, them, themselves, then, thence, there, thereafter, thereby, therefore, therein, thereupon, these, they, thick, thin, third, this, those, though, three, through, throughout, thru, thus, to, together, too, top, toward, towards, twelve, twenty, two, un, under, until, up, upon, us, very, via, was, we, well, were, what, whatever, when, whence, whenever, where, whereafter, whereas, whereby, wherein, whereupon, wherever, whether, which, while, whither, who, whoever, whole, whom, whose, why, will, with, within, without, would, yet, you, your, yours, yourself, yourselves, whatever)

    import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.StopWordsRemover

    // Set Params for StopWordsRemover with new_stopwords
    val remover = new StopWordsRemover()
    .setStopWords(new_stopwords)
    .setInputCol("tokens")
    .setOutputCol("filtered")

    // Create new df with new list of stopwords removed
    val new_filtered_df = remover.transform(tokenized_df)

> import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.StopWordsRemover remover: org.apache.spark.ml.feature.StopWordsRemover = stopWords\_4029322e305c new\_filtered\_df: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = \[id: bigint, corpus: string, movieTitle: string, movieYear: string, tokens: array&lt;string&gt;, filtered: array&lt;string&gt;\]

    // Set Params for CountVectorizer
    val vectorizer = new CountVectorizer()
    .setInputCol("filtered")
    .setOutputCol("features")
    .setVocabSize(10000)
    .setMinDF(5)
    .fit(new_filtered_df)

    // Create new df of countVectors
    val new_countVectors = vectorizer.transform(new_filtered_df).select("id", "features")

> vectorizer: org.apache.spark.ml.feature.CountVectorizerModel = cntVec\_68b272a90616 new\_countVectors: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = \[id: bigint, features: vector\]

    // Convert DF to RDD
    val new_lda_countVector = new_countVectors.map { case Row(id: Long, countVector: Vector) => (id, countVector) }

> new\_lda\_countVector: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD\[(Long, org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Vector)\] = MapPartitionsRDD\[358\] at map at &lt;console&gt;:92

We will also increase MaxIterations to 10 to see if we get better results.

    // Set LDA parameters
    val new_lda = new LDA()
    .setOptimizer(new OnlineLDAOptimizer().setMiniBatchFraction(0.8))
    .setK(numTopics)
    .setMaxIterations(10)
    .setDocConcentration(-1) // use default values
    .setTopicConcentration(-1) // use default values

> new\_lda: org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.LDA = org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.LDA@5c137f48

#### How to find what the default values are?

Dive into the source!!!

1.  Let's find the default value for `docConcentration` now.
2.  Got to Apache Spark package Root: <https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/#package>

-   search for 'ml' in the search box on the top left (ml is for ml library)
-   Then find the `LDA` by scrolling below on the left to mllib's `clustering` methods and click on `LDA`
-   Then click on the source code link which should take you here:
-   <https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v1.6.1/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/clustering/LDA.scala>
-   Now, simply go to the right function and see the following comment block:

`/**    * Concentration parameter (commonly named "alpha") for the prior placed on documents'    * distributions over topics ("theta").    *    * This is the parameter to a Dirichlet distribution, where larger values mean more smoothing    * (more regularization).    *    * If not set by the user, then docConcentration is set automatically. If set to    * singleton vector [alpha], then alpha is replicated to a vector of length k in fitting.    * Otherwise, the [[docConcentration]] vector must be length k.    * (default = automatic)    *    * Optimizer-specific parameter settings:    *  - EM    *     - Currently only supports symmetric distributions, so all values in the vector should be    *       the same.    *     - Values should be > 1.0    *     - default = uniformly (50 / k) + 1, where 50/k is common in LDA libraries and +1 follows    *       from Asuncion et al. (2009), who recommend a +1 adjustment for EM.    *  - Online    *     - Values should be >= 0    *     - default = uniformly (1.0 / k), following the implementation from    *       [[https://github.com/Blei-Lab/onlineldavb]].    * @group param    */`

**HOMEWORK:** Try to find the default value for `TopicConcentration`.

    // Create LDA model with stopwords refiltered
    val new_ldaModel = new_lda.run(new_lda_countVector)

Step 9. Create LDA model with Expectation Maximization
------------------------------------------------------

Let's try creating an LDA model with Expectation Maximization on the data that has been refiltered for additional stopwords. We will also increase MaxIterations here to 100 to see if that improves results. See: \* <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-clustering.html#latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda>.

    import org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.EMLDAOptimizer

    // Set LDA parameters
    val em_lda = new LDA()
    .setOptimizer(new EMLDAOptimizer())
    .setK(numTopics)
    .setMaxIterations(100)
    .setDocConcentration(-1) // use default values
    .setTopicConcentration(-1) // use default values

> import org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.EMLDAOptimizer em\_lda: org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.LDA = org.apache.spark.mllib.clustering.LDA@58eb41bb

We've managed to get some good results here. For example, we can easily infer that Topic 2 is about space, Topic 3 is about israel, etc.

We still get some ambiguous results like Topic 0.

To improve our results further, we could employ some of the below methods: - Refilter data for additional data-specific stopwords - Use Stemming or Lemmatization to preprocess data - Experiment with a smaller number of topics, since some of these topics in the 20 Newsgroups are pretty similar - Increase model's MaxIterations

Visualize Results
-----------------

We will try visualizing the results obtained from the EM LDA model with a d3 bubble chart.

    // Zip topic terms with topic IDs
    val termArray = topics.zipWithIndex

Step 1. Downloading and Loading Data into DBFS
----------------------------------------------

Here are the steps taken for downloading and saving data to the distributed file system. Uncomment them for repeating this process on your databricks cluster or for downloading a new source of data.

Unfortunately, the original data at:

-   <http://www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/data/cornell_movie_dialogs_corpus.zip>

is not suited for manipulation and loading into dbfs easily. So the data has been downloaded, directory renamed without white spaces, superfluous OS-specific files removed, `dos2unix`'d, `tar -zcvf`'d and uploaded to the following URL for an easily dbfs-loadable download:

-   <http://lamastex.org/datasets/public/nlp/cornell_movie_dialogs_corpus.tgz>
