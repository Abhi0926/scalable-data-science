# Article topics in retweet network

*Scalable data science course project by Li Caldeira Balkest√•hl and Mariama Jaiteh*

The aim of the project is to apply topic modelling on web articles linked in tweets obtained from Twitter. Since each article (and its topics) is linked to a user, we hope to highlight the topics spread by every user in their Twitter network.


## How to run the notebook
The repos contains the scala source code and databricks notebook of our project. 

To run the notebook in databrick, upload the Presentation.dbc and 1_web\_scraping\_clean.dbc in your databricks account and run the cells in the Presentation notebook.
