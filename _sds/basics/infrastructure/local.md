## How to work with Apache Spark on or from your local laptop or desktop computer?

We will mostly be using Apace Spark via the free *databricks community edition* from [https://community.cloud.databricks.com/](https://community.cloud.databricks.com). Just Sign Up if you have not done so already.
 
To work on the databricks community edition all you need is a laptop computer with a browser and internet connection.

If you do not own a laptop, which is highly recommened for the course, then you may use a desktop computer that you can access (perhaps in a computer lab).


It is also important to be able to run Spark locally on your laptop. 
**Optionally** after some downloads and setups, you can

* work with `scala-shell` from command-line, or
* [work with Scala-IDE](/sds/basics/infrastructure/local/sparkScala/).
