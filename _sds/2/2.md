# SDS-2.2

**This is under construction!!!**

## Scalable Data Science from Atlantis, A Big Data Course in Apache Spark 2.2

There are two parts to the course: 

1. Introduction to Data Science
2.  Fundamentals of Data Science


## Introduction to Data Science

## Course Description
Data Science is the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data in a practical and scalable manner.  A data scientist is characterized by an integrated skill set spanning mathematics, statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, databases and optimization along with a deep understanding of the craft of problem formulation to engineer effective solutions ([DOI:10.1145/2500499](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2500499), [DOI: 10.1126/science.aaa8415](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6245/255.full-text.pdf+html)).  This course will introduce students to this rapidly growing field and equip them with some of its basic principles and tools.  

Students will learn concepts,  techniques and tools they need to deal with various facets of data science  practice, including collecting, extracting, transforming, loading, exploring, integrating and analyzing data.  The emphasis will be on predictive modeling, descriptive modeling, model tuning and evaluation, data product creation and effective communication.
The focus in the treatment of these topics will be on multi-disciplinary breadth required for data science, rather than technical depth in a particular aspect of the topic.  The emphasis will be on integration and synthesis of concepts and their practical application to solving problems.  To make the learning concrete, real datasets from a variety of disciplines will be used throughout the course.  

## Learning Outcomes -- Introduction to Data Science (5 points)

At the conclusion of the course, students should be able to:
- Describe what Data Science is and the skill sets needed to be a data scientist.
- Explain in basic terms what probability models are and how statistical inference and learning can go from data to the model (model fitting).  
- Understand common probability distributions and simulate from them.
- Describe the Data Science Process and how its components interact.
- Understand the fundamental conceps in distributed storage, in-memory computing and fault-tolerance.
- Use a working knowledge of the core languages used by data scientists (shell/noSQL/python/scala/R) to carry out various elements/stages of the data science process in Apache Spark's scalable and production-ready pipeline:
  - Extract, transform and load (ETL) into distributed filestore
  - Explore data (visually using plots and structurally using SQL)
  - Understand the process of training, validating and testing models for prediction

## Learning Outcomes -- Applied Data Science (10 points)

Introduction to Data Science (5 points) is a pre-requisite for this course.

At the conclusion of the course, students should be able to:
- Use a working knowledge of the core languages used by data scientists (shell/noSQL/python/scala/R) to carry out various elements/stages of the data science process in Apache Spark's scalable and production-ready pipeline:
  - Collect data (scrape from web, use Twitter API, etc.)
  - Anonymize data (for privacy or security)
  - Extract, transform and load (ETL) into distributed filestore
  - Explore data (visually using plots and structurally using SQL)
  - Train, validate and test for prediction
  - Serve the model's predictions to the client
- Apply the Data Science process in a case study of their own (course project).
- Apply  basic  machine  learning  algorithms for predictive modeling (unsupervised and supervised).  
- Explain fundamental mathematical and algorithmic ingredients underpinning the learning algorithms (using concepts from linear algebra, multivatiate calculus and statistics)
- Build their own predictions from data: classifier, recommender, regressor.
- Create meaningful visualization and communicate persuasively (both orally and through github pages).
- Work effectively in teams of 2 or 3 on data science project (course project).
- Understand the ethical and privacy issues in the data science process and apply ethical practices.
- Prepare better for the industry-certified examinations for Data Scientists.
  
## Audience
The course sequence is suitable for upper-level undergraduate (or beginning graduate) students in computer science, computer engineering, electrical  engineering, physics, chemistry, applied  mathematics, statistics, business, computational sciences (computational biology, computational sociology, etc.), and related analytic/quantitative fields in Science and Technology.

## Prerequisites
Students are recommended to have basic knowledge of algorithms and some programming experience (equivalent to completing an introductory course in computer science), and some familiarity with basic linear algebra and basic probability and statistics. These basic concepts will be introduced quickly and one could take the course by putting extra effort on these basics as the course progresses.  

The course consists of lectures (three times a week, 45x2=90 minutes each), and involves a set of assignments (about 4) and a substantial project.  The course project could take one of the following forms:
- analyzing an interesting dataset  using  existing  methods 
- obtaining your own dataset and analyzing it using existing methods 
- building  your  own  data  product  
- focussing on the theoretical properties of an algorithm, etc.
  
Students are encouraged to work in teams of two or three for a project.  
Assignments, on the other hand, are to be completed individually.

## Grading
Your final grade will be determined based on your performance on each of the following items: 

- Class participation and comprehensive quizzes (10%)
- Assignments (40%) -- to be done individually (4 x 10% in python/scala/R/SQL)
- Project (50%) -- to be done in groups of two or three 
  - Written part of Project  (20%)
  - Oral Presentation (10%)
  - Technical Accuracy and Originality (10%)
  - Synergetic Team-work (10%) -- peer-graded
