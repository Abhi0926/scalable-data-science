Ben Sasse won't say","Ben Sasse never liked Donald Trump. He still doesn’t like Trump. And now that he’s promoting his new book, “The Vanishing American Adult,” the freshman Nebraska senator doesn’t want to talk about whether the 45th president of the United States counts as an adult, according to the principles he lays out across 300 pages. Sasse would rather not be talking about Trump, but when pressed, he says the president is a symptom of exactly what he thinks is wrong with America.\n\nTrump “comes out of a reality TV world,” Sasse told me in the latest episode of POLITICO’s Off Message podcast. “And I have lots of anxiety about whether or not that kind of world is really what we want for our kids.”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSasse, a former university president, is beloved by both the conservative intelligentsia and by bitter Democrats who agree that he’s something like the last honest man in the GOP. He has a practiced, unassuming air about everything except his intelligence, which he doesn’t try to backslap away, in person or in print (back in the days when he says he never thought about going into politics, he picked up a Ph.D. in American history from Yale, with a lauded dissertation about the rise of secularism). He’s one of the few senators who arrived without ever holding public office before, but he’s picked up most of the tricks, like talking past questions he doesn’t want to answer and picking up little bits of biography at the start of a conversation that he’ll work in later to personalize it.\n\nThese days, he’s a microcosm of many Republicans in the age of Trump — still holding close to his beliefs (whether school choice or international trade deals), wary of how the man in the Oval Office will rewrite the party’s genetic code, trying to keep some distance without making a big show of it.\n\nUnlike many in Congress, though, Sasse is willing to voice his criticisms of Trump out loud … sort of. When really pressed, when he can’t divert the conversation another way, when he can’t avoid saying what he really thinks. (“He and I obviously have a very different view of the world” is one of the understated deflections he landed on at one point.)\n\nAlmost as big a problem for Sasse is what the leader of his party means for Republicanism.\n\nAsked what the GOP stands for, he says, “I don’t know.”\n\nNaturally, all of this has people wondering about Sasse’s own future. He’s up for reelection in 2020, and the speculation ranges from being one term and done to jumping into a White House run of his own. I asked him about both, and he didn’t say no to either — instead, he threw out a prefabricated joke about how “the noxious-weed control board of Dodge County, Nebraska, is likely my political future. I have the two callings that I want right now.”\n\nBut in the meantime, Sasse fought his publisher not to have his photo or the word “senator” on the cover of his book, which is where he wants the focus. As a father of three and now the author of a manifesto diagnosing a culture and politics of national existential crisis so deep that, as he writes at one point, “our kids are not ready for the world they are soon going to inherit,” he can’t help looking at the message coming from the top.\n\nSasse’s formula for true adulthood consists of five main steps: Overcome “peer culture,” or associating just with people of similar ages; work hard; limit consumption of television or other passive media in favor of producing art or music or anything else; travel widely to understand how various people understand the difference between what they need and what they want; and become literate by reading widely and deeply.\n\nCompare that with a president who does not spend much time outside his usual circles and has not prioritized diversity in his Cabinet or West Wing staff, who’s known for liking large parts of his day unstructured and is well-known for watching hours of cable news, whose nine-day foreign trip was one of the longest stretches he’s gone without sleeping a night at one of his own properties, and who prefers that his information be presented verbally or in one-page bullet point memos.\n\n“There’s a risk in our media-driven, and particularly digital media-driven, culture, [our] TV-based, broadcast-based and image-based culture of this digital moment,” Sasse says. “There is a danger that we create shorter and shorter attention spans, more and more unbridled passions, less and less self-control and self-restraint. I don’t think that our Founders would believe that America could long prosper if the people were not readers.”\n\nI asked him how, in a word, he’d describe Trump. All he came up with: “current president.”\n\nBut Trump isn’t his only problem. Asked for one word to describe the Republican Party, he again came up with two: “question mark.”\n\nSasse says his book is 100 percent not about politics and 99 percent not about policy, but that’s only true in the Republicans vs. Democrats, pass this bill or that bill kind of way. Entire sections of the book are about philosopher John Dewey and Peter Pan, and the closest he comes to mentioning the president is titling a chapter “Make America An Idea Again.”\n\nBut “The Vanishing American Adult” is a damning critique of U.S. cultural decline nonetheless, and in that sense it’s an intensely political book. There’s more than enough bipartisan blame to go around for the rot at the core of American exceptionalism, Sasse believes, and he’s urging a revolution in how people think about themselves, their children and their country. Years before Trump arrived, he says, Washington was making that harder every step of the way.\n\nOn top of that, Sasse says, Trump and every other politician who’s promised that the factory or jobs at other old-economy institutions are coming back has made things worse.\n\n“Quit lying to the voters. Tell the truth about where we are in economic history, and admit that technology and, ultimately, automation that goes all the way to machine learning and artificial intelligence is going to accelerate economic change in the world,” he said in the interview.\n\nSasse thinks the Democratic Party is “fighting 1960s battles,” but he argues his own party “is absolutely nuts” to allow Democrats to own issues like income inequality and flatlining wages.\n\nEven if people disagree with him that Washington needs to catch up to the times on other issues, Sasse says, they should at least see how desperate the situation is when it comes to homeland defense.\n\n“We’re completely unprepared for the pace of change that’s coming as cyber disrupts warfare,” Sasse warns. His conversations as a member of the Armed Services Committee have made him sure that Russia was trying to influence last year’s election, and he wants a full investigation to determine how much it succeeded and how much of it might have been directly on Trump’s behalf instead of just to stir chaos.\n\nWhat’s coming is worse, he believes, and he doesn’t see any evidence the government is moving to prepare itself.\n\n“We need to be looking to 2018 and 2020 for what comes next because they are going to fuzzy up the distinction between military and civilian targets,” Sasse says. “We don’t have any of the right mental frameworks for how to debate this yet.”\n\nSasse got the idea for “The Vanishing American Adult” before he ran for Senate, when he was the president of Midland University in Nebraska. He didn’t get an agent or start writing until last year, when the presidential nominees were already all but set.\n\nHe envisioned promoting his vision for the country at a very different time for America, when he wouldn’t have to spend as much time discussing you know who.\n\nI ask Sasse whether the book tour would be easier if he didn’t have to keep talking about Trump all the time. “I’m not,” he says, “going to argue with that.”","www.politico.com","Trump &quot;comes out of a reality TV world,&quot; the Nebraska senator says. &quot;And I have lots of anxiety about whether or not that kind of world is really what we want for our kids.&quot;","","found"],["https://twitter.com/arell_sound/status/860015341879033856","Twitter","You are on Twitter Mobile because you are using an old version of Firefox.

Officials from NHS Digital said all non-urgent patient activity has been suspended and that up to 25 health service organisations were hit.\n\nHealthcare officials have been posting to social media about the widespread outages. \"We got a message saying your computers are now under their control and pay a certain amount of money. And now everything is gone,\" one message read.\n\nIn a statement, the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust said: \"Today (Friday, 12 May 2017), the trust has experienced a major IT problem, believed to be caused by a cyberattack.\n\n\"Immediately on discovery of the problem, the trust acted to protect its IT systems by shutting them down; it also meant that the trust's telephone system is not able to accept incoming calls.\n\n\"The trust is postponing all non-urgent activity for today and is asking people not to come to A&E - please ring NHS111 for urgent medical advice or 999 if it is a life-threatening emergency.\n\n\"To ensure that all back-up processes and procedures were put in place quickly, the trust declared a major internal incident to make sure that patients already in the trust's hospitals continued to receive the care they need.\"\n\nAccording to The Visitor, Dr Tony Naughton, chief clinical officer at Fylde and Wyre CCG, described the issue as \"national\". The outlet said technical teams have been called to investigate the problems – but that computers in walk-in centres and selected hospitals are being shut down.\n\nNHS England initially said that by 15:30 (BST), 16 NHS organisations had reported they were affected by this issue. The press office declined to say how many patients were likely to be affected. The BBC reported that ransomware infections were also recorded in Scotland.\n\nAn official statement read: \"A number of NHS organisations have reported to NHS Digital that they have been affected by a ransomware attack which is affecting a number of different organisations.\n\n\"The investigation is at an early stage but we believe the malware variant is Wanna Decryptor.\n\n\"At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed. We will continue to work with affected organisations to confirm this.\n\n\"NHS Digital is working closely with the National Cyber Security Centre, the Department of Health and NHS England to support affected organisations and to recommend appropriate mitigations.\n\n\"This attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and is affecting organisations from across a range of sectors. Our focus is on supporting organisations to manage the incident swiftly and decisively, but we will continue to communicate with NHS colleagues and will share more information as it becomes available.\"\n\nThe ransomware is the same variant as ishitting multiple companies in Spain, which has been blamed on a known – yet patched – vulnerability in Microsoft Windows.\n\nThe hackers are reportedly exploiting a critical vulnerability (MS17-010) that first received a patch on 14 March. \"The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker sends specially crafted messages,\" Microsoft warned at the time.\n\nNHS Merseyside said on Twitter: \"Following a suspected national cyber attack we are taking all precautionary measures possible to protect our local NHS systems and services. We're sorry that phone and email communication are down at present. We will keep you updated.\"\n\nThe ransomware is reportedly demanding bitcoin. \"Your important files are encrypted. Maybe you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but do not waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service,\" a warning reads.\n\nOne NHS IT worker toldThe Guardianthe incident started just after midday (BST). \"This is affecting the east of England and number of other trusts. This is the largest outage of this nature I've seen in the six years I've been employed with the NHS,\" the source said.\n\nThe hackers are reportedly asking for $300 in return for the locked files. Images of the hijacked computer screens have now started to circulate on social media.\n\n\"We apologise but we are having issues with our computer systems. Please don't attend A&E unless it's an emergency. Thanks for your patience,\" said Blackpool Hospitals in a Twitter update.\n\nThe National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a fork of UK spy agency GCHQ, said that it is now probing the scale of the ransomware attacks. \"We are working with NHS Digital and the National Crime Agency (NCA) to investigate,\" it said in a statement.\n\nJakub Kroustek, threat lab lead at Avast, a cybersecurity firm, indicated the ongoing attacks may be more widespread than previously known.\n\n\"We have observed a massive peak in WanaCrypt0r 2.0 attacks today, with more than 36,000 detections, so far,\" he said. \"An interesting observation we have made is that the attacks today are largely targeting Russia, Ukraine, and Taiwan.\"\n\nMalwareHunterTeam, a well-known cybersecurity-focused Twitter account, said the ransomware was \"spreading like hell.\" Its researchers said victims spanned 11 countries.","www.ibtimes.co.uk","All non-urgent activity has been suspended, NHS England said in a statement.","","found"],["https://www.pscp.tv/w/bASHBTMwOTcwNDd8MWdxeHZiWVBsd3d4QnlauD3YhgyvYPb3OEoG4mZXHCc97PrHWizzx8meLKa8","ياسر العصيفير: \"كيف تصبح تقنياً خطيراً","","www.pscp.tv","ياسر العصيفير (@alosefer) from Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

She studied for her Bachelor’s Degree in Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the University of Bradford, followed by her Masters of Science in Engineering Project Management at the University of Leeds. CGT produces alternators designed for prime power, standby, oil and gas, mining and marine. \n\nMy career is at its early stages, nonetheless, one filled with excitement and change. I started my career in Cummins Generator Technologies (CGT) as a graduate Product Applications Engineer. During the first half of my graduate scheme, my focus was to provide technical expertise to our customers, and more specifically aligning their power and application needs with the most appropriate alternator solution.\n\nFor the second term of my graduate scheme, I have had the opportunity to transition to another function within the same department (Customer Engineering). This is my current roles as well. This role, involves leading the Customer Engineering lane for New Product Introduction (NPI) programmes.\n\nA great influence of me becoming an engineer was my father. He is a chartered electrical engineer himself and has his own business. He is a great role model, as he would never tell me I could not do something, in terms of career. He actually encouraged me to follow his footsteps.\n\nEvery summer holidays, I would work with him, doing light and power designs for complex buildings. I remember the first day I arrived at the office, he gave me a laptop, an office drawing and asked me to complete all the power design for that specific building. I just looked at him, and said, “You know I am 16, and it’s my first day at work, right?” And right there and then, I learned the first lesson of being an engineer “You have a problem – figure it out!” Within the same week, I learned how to use AutoCAD and to get the job done. That feeling of being lost, and then finding your way and making it, that’s what engineering is all about for me.\n\nAs mentioned, currently I am leading the Customer Engineering function for NPI programmes. I have four programmes at the moment, all at different stages. My role is to ensure that our customers’ technical needs are being addressed by the programme. For each new programme, I conduct technical market research and use that information to benchmark our own. Another exercise that I am currently executing is Voice of the Customer (VoC) interviews, where, a selection of key customers are being interviewed with the aim of understanding their technical requirements, so they can be fed back to the programme’s scope.\n\nAnother key deliverable is conducting validation trials with our customers. For example, fit and form trials between the alternator and the engine, and its overall electrical and mechanical performance when incorporated into the generator. Here, my role is to liaise with customers, the Marketing and Commercial teams, in order to gain customers’ agreement for our trials.\n\nMy job from day to day varies quite significantly, as things tend to change a lot, and I need to adapt to the needs of each programme. However, if I was to summarise my day to day job, is to align functions to complete all customer facing deliverables.\n\nA typical stereotype of engineers is that we are introverts. Well, in this case the stereotype is right, because I am an introvert myself. However, I call myself a hybrid introvert, and that is because of my current role. The most rewarding part of my role, is surprisingly interacting with people.\n\nMy job relies on other functions delivering things on time, as I will be requiring it as an input to complete my own tasks. At the beginning of my role, I was emailing people telling them “Do this for me, by this time”, and the time would usually be now. Well there was no surprise that nobody would deliver anything. Then I decided to pay them a visit and tell them that I need something and they have to do it. And yes, I would skip all the introductions, hellos and how are you conversations as I thought were time consuming. Even then, no results until one day I decided to change approach and get really interested in people.\n\nSo, the terrifying coffee machine general chats were on! My current role allowed me to build and expand my network, beyond my department. It also taught me, how to switch off the introvert, and be an extrovert, and that if you want to persuade people to do stuff for you, then they should want to do it, not because you told them so.\n\nQuite recently, one female acquaintance asked me what I do for a living. I replied with “I am an Applications Engineer”. The next question I was expecting was “What is an Applications Engineer?”, as application engineering is not a taught university degree, and people may not know what it means. Instead, I got the typical reply “Engineer? So, you fix stuff?”\n\nHaving being faced with this question so many times (I have lost count) I have formulated a ready response. I explain to them that engineering is not necessarily about fixing stuff. Is more about creating, innovating, designing and problem solving. Then I move on to explaining the difference between an engineer and a technician, by giving the example of car design engineer and a mechanic. The person that actually thought about the performance, the looks, the functions of the car – that’s an engineer. A technician or a mechanic is the person who will fix the car, once a component breaks.\n\nAnother example of how the current perception of engineering is putting women off is illustrated by my younger sister. She loves doing make-up and wants to be a make-up artist. However, my parents come from a background where unless you go university, you are minimising your chances of success. So, skipping university and doing a one month course on make-up was not an option.\n\nAt that moment, I decided to persuade my sister to go to university. I asked her why she wanted to be a make-up artist. Her response was: “It’s creative, it allows me to express myself.” My next question, was regarding her future: “So, once you become a make-up artist, what’s next?” “Oh, I don’t want to be just a make-up artist. I want to have my own business, develop my own products, be more and more creative!” And that’s when I said: “What about engineering?”\n\nThe look in her face just said it all. It was a mix of disappointment and frustration, like I wasn’t even listening to her. Before, she jumped to any conclusions, I explained to her that engineering is not limited to electrical, mechanical and civil. There are a plethora of engineering disciplines and one that could suit her is chemical engineering. I went further and elaborated that if she wanted to create her own products, what better way than to do it herself? I am happy to report that she starts her course in Cosmetic Science and Engineering this September!\n\nFor me, engineering has to relate to something I am passionate about. All of the objects that surround us have been engineered and developed because somebody had the vision and the passion have an idea and to do something about it. Therefore, my first advice is to understand your main drivers and passions. Once you have an idea of what you are interested in, then the search for selecting an appropriate engineering discipline can begin.\n\nFor example, if you have a great interest in the environment and sustainability, then there is that exact engineering discipline you can follow. Another example, is when someone has a passion of helping people, specifically around the medical field, one option could be medical engineering or even biomedical. The options are there, all you need to do is have a look. A simple internet search on ‘engineering disciplines’ will increase your knowledge of what engineering has to offer.\n\nSo, how do we make engineering more attractive to more women? Engineering needs a total re-brand!\n\nSince I joined CGT I have participated in numerous projects that aim to attract and retain more women in engineering. For me this year, is about celebrating our achievements and progress, and most importantly letting people know about it.\n\nVisuals will be displayed across different sites of CGT, representatives from the affinity groups of technical women and STEM ambassadors will be promoting their projects and getting more volunteers to help make a change.\n\nHaving a dedicated day where female engineers are celebrated is quite important for raising awareness and helping remove barriers and stereotypes. This also gives an insight to potential female engineers on what type of career they can develop in engineering. In addition, International Women in Engineering Day is important as it gives the right visibility to key female engineering figures – this is a great opportunity for female engineers to gain role models and potential mentors.\n\nCGT is going through some exciting times right now, as we are doing a complete refresh of our product lines. As with any engineering company, products need to be up-to-date, in order to continuously address market and customer needs.\n\nAs stated, my career is still at its early stages, however, one filled with change. I am looking forward to transitioning to my new role, where it is critical for the planning and completion of these product refreshment programmes. I will be joining the Product Planning team, where, my key responsibilities will evolve around scoping programmes, understanding key future technologies and applications that the company should be investing in, along with market research and many more.\n\nThis role differs significantly from the one I am currently doing. I will still be heavily involved with engineering aspects (we are a technology company after all!) however, this time it will be engineering from a business perspective.\n\nI believe my technical background is what has given me the edge to be able to transition in such a diverse role. Having engineering as my foundation, has given me the opportunities to broaden my career horizons. Is worth highlighting that engineers can be very good at any career they choose, as being an engineer means being able to logically solve problems and adapt – qualities that any job requires."],[8,"Why aircraft can’t abandon Buhari, by Presidency — Nigeria — The Guardian Nigeria Newspaper – Nigeria and World News","• Says jet has incured only N48m parking fee in London • APC governors flay Fayose’s comment on president * United Kingdom’s govt deports 28 Nigerians\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force One (NAF 001) plane that took President Muhammadu Buhari to London has incurred at least N48 million since the number one citizen started receiving medical care in the United Kingdom (UK) till date.\n\nThe amount accounts for the aircraft’s parking charges for 105 days, at the rate of £1,000 (N460, 000) per night.\n\nThe presidency yesterday confirmed the £1,000 charges, to disclaim allegation that £4,000 (N1.8 million) is spent on ‘Eagle One’ per day and a total of N193.2 million in the last 105 days.\n\nPresident Buhari is currently on the second treatment session in UK and has spent 54 days already. The first treatment session was between January 19 and March 10, which meant 51 days. On both occasions, the presidential jet remained idle on the parking lot.\n\nThe presidency, however, defended the retention in UK of the aircraft, citing national security and prestige accorded world leaders when they travel abroad.\n\nThe clarification came amidst criticisms, mostly on social media, of the retention in London of the presidential aircraft manned by personnel of the Nigeria Air Force since Buhari arrived in the UK.\n\nThe presidential fleet of about 10 aircraft last year came under heavy criticism with claims that they gulped over N5.8 billion annually. Two of the aircraft have since been put up for sale.\n\nExperts were unanimous that the presidential jet would have cost the Nigerian taxpayers more than N48 million in total, given the cost of catering for the accompanying crew of no fewer than 12 persons.\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, ‎said “there is no world leader who travels abroad and is left without plans for immediate return or possible evacuation.”\n\nThe development, according to the presidency, is in tandem with standard operating procedure and‎ international protocol around foreign trips by heads of state all over the world.\n\nThe presidency stated that the country’s Armed Forces as represented by the Nigeria Air Force could not therefore abandon the commander-in-chief in whichever circumstance he is in that country.\n\n“For the avoidance of doubt, this president is not the first to have a presidential aircraft standing by for him, as he will certainly not be the last.  All past heads of this country have had this privilege, and the part that surprises the most is that leaders who in the past travelled with three Nigerian aircraft did not suffer this trenchant criticism,” the presidency noted.\n\nThe statement noted that, “aircraft conveying heads of state all over the world usually enjoy waivers even where payments for parking are differentiated by aircraft categories.\n\n“We have been assured that where the waiver is not granted, payment will not exceed £1,000, which is a quarter of the amount being peddled.”\n\nThe statement appealed to Nigerians to ignore opposition campaign aimed at derailing the administration’s big plans for the country.\n\n“This is a government that is constructing the Second Niger Bridge, the Mambila Power Plant, the East-West and the North-South standard gauge railway lines.\n\n“We are a government that has saved this country an annual loss of two trillion naira from fraudulent petroleum subsidy schemes by influential citizens and their children, and ridden the public service of about 50,000 ghost workers. The Buhari administration certainly deserves a chance,” the statement said.\n\nAlso yesterday, governors under the umbrella of the All Progressives Congress (APC) came hard on their Ekiti State counterpart, Ayo Fayose, over his allegation that Buhari is on life support.\n\nThe APC governors also stated that all powers of government have been handed over to the Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo pending the return of Buhari to Nigeria.\n\nThe Chairman of the APC Governors Forum, Rochas Okorocha, in an interview with State House correspondents in Abuja urged Nigerians to ignore Fayose’s comment on Buhari’s health, even as he described it as baseless.\n\nOkorocha said the comment by Fayose who is also the Chairman of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors Forum was capable of throwing the country into chaos.\n\nAlso, the UK yesterday deported 28 Nigerians for committing immigration-related offences in the country.\n\nThey were sent back home barely 48 hours after 23 Nigerians were deported from Spain and five days after another batch of 34 was jointly deported by the governments of Switzerland, Germany, Iceland, Austria, Belgium and Hungary.\n\nThe fresh batch of deportees arrived at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos around 12: 13 p.m.\n\nThe Spokesperson of the Lagos Airport Police Command, Divisional Superintendent of Police (DSP) Joseph Alabi, confirmed the development to reporters.\n\nAlabi said the deportees, comprising 21 males and seven females, were brought back aboard a chartered Titanic Airways aircraft with registration number AWC-761/2.\n\nHe said they were received by officers of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) and the police.\n\nAlso available to receive them were officials of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN)."],[8,"‘She was screaming': father tells of how council tried to take girl, 3, from asylum family","Ali says he wasn’t home when social workers came to tell his wife, Jamileh, that their three-year-old daughter would be removed from their care, but he heard the conversation, the cries of his wife and screams of his child, over the phone.\n\n“My wife was really scared and my child was really scared. She was under the table where they were sitting, screaming: ‘I don’t want to go anywhere,’ and scratching the walls. It was so horrific that the interpreter got really upset,” he says.\n\nThat week, Ali and Jamileh, Iranians seeking asylum in the UK, had been told that the Home Office no longer accepted their claim of destitution, which meant they were no longer entitled to housing or financial support and were facing imminent eviction.\n\n“My wife was told: ‘We have got a duty of care towards the child and it’s our responsibility now that you’ve got no roof over your head to look after her. But we have no duty towards you, so you can live anywhere you like, but we’re taking her.’ And they gave us an address to drop the child off. They said: ‘You should bring the child the next day.’”\n\nCharities have told the Guardian of many cases in the last year in which local authorities have told parents they have a duty to house children, but no duty to their parents, despite obligations under section 17 of the Children’s Act to keep families together.\n\nAli arrived in the UK on his daughter’s third birthday, in September 2015, and claimed asylum. He says he fled Iran after receiving death threats for his political work. His wife and daughter, Leila, came with him, though they had not been threatened.\n\nAsylum seekers are not allowed to work while claims are pending. Those with access to money are required to support themselves. Those who don’t are entitled to accommodation and a weekly allowance of £36.95 for each person.\n\nAli’s family claimed destitution and were sent to live in Manchester and then Bury. A few months after their arrival they were told their claim of destitution had been rejected. The Home Office claimed an old bank card in Jamileh’s name and a house in Iran belonging to Ali were proof they had means to support themselves. (The Home Office later accepted that they were not.) The family were given two days to move out of their accommodation.\n\nAli and Jamileh did not hand Leila over, but were instead helped by Tim Cheprasov, the pastor of Bury baptist church. Cheprasov took them to the home of a family in his congregation, with whom they lived for a month. After this they lived in a succession of different places until the Home Office accepted they really were destitute, and reinstated support.\n\nA spokesman for Bury council said: “Without any details about the family you mention, we do not recognise either the specific circumstances of this matter or the general practice.\n\n“We would always assess the situation in line with the Children’s Act and provide services dependent upon the assessed needs of the children. General practice, for which there are many examples, has been to provide temporary accommodation (generally hotel) during the period of assessment. It is not the practice of the council to seek to separate children from their families solely on the basis on NRPF [no recourse to public funds].”\n\nAli said his wife was deeply affected by the fear of having her daughter removed from her care. For weeks after they were evicted, Ali says, Jamileh was vomiting and could not sleep. At one point, Ali recalls Leila said to her mother: “Mama, you look scary.”\n\n“From the day that the social services came to the premises my wife just went very, very quiet and from that day she was severely emotional. She had a lump in her throat that she just couldn’t break,” he said.\n\nJamileh’s parents convinced her that staying in Britain was too stressful and she and Leila have since returned to Iran, where they are waiting for Ali to hear the result of his asylum claim. If he is granted leave to remain, he will then have to apply to bring them over to the UK under family reunion provisions.\n\n“My daughter has a very bad memory of England,” says Ali. “Some English tourists were visiting a restaurant [in Iran] and she heard them and she hid under the table and started screaming: ‘No, they’re going to take me away.’ She gets asked: ‘Do you want to come and see Daddy?’ She cries: ‘No, I don’t want to go back there.’ Unfortunately she’s been scarred by this.”\n\nAli adds: “The reason I fled the country was to have a safe, comfortable life alongside my family, not wake up to a threat – who’s going to come in and arrest me? Who is going to take me away? I fear for my life, so I have to be here. I’d love to be next to my child. This is the best time of my child growing up – she’s now talking properly, putting sentences together – and I hate to miss it, but I’ve got no other alternative.”\n\nAll names in this article have been changed to protect identities."],[8,"As Voodoo Economics Fails in Kansas, Trump Takes It National","In 2015, Grover Norquist, who has successfully defined unconditional opposition to taxes as the defining tenet of party orthodoxy, waxed enthusiastic about one state in particular that was leading the way for the nation. “Kansas is the future,” he told an interviewer. “Kansas is the model.” Kansas was the state where Sam Brownback, the former congressman who mentored a young staffer named Paul Ryan, implemented supply-side tax cuts that, Brownback promised, would usher in prosperity and fiscal stability.\n\nNow Brownback’s tax cuts have failed so dramatically and incontrovertibly that the state’s Republican legislature overrode Brownback’s veto to eliminate them. Incredibly, a majority of the Republicans in both chambers of the state legislature voted against the tax cuts. In a new interview with Russell Berman, Norquist insists the failure in Kansas does not tell us much at all about anything. “If you’re a Republican looking for a model,” he says, “Kansas is not the model.”\n\nOne might think that the economists who designed this now-repudiated plan would have been cast out of the party, or at least embarrassed into rethinking their assumptions. Yet nothing of the sort has taken place. Stephen Moore and Art Laffer, the supply-siders who crafted the failed Kansas experiment, are also taking the lead in designing Donald Trump’s tax plan. Their op-ed urging the president to throw himself behind massively regressive, debt-financed tax cuts found its way into his hands. So profoundly did their argument impress Trump that he instructed his advisers to immediately release a tax-cut plan mirroring the recommendations made by the architects of the Kansas debacle. Now the machinery of government is in the hands of people determined to replicate a policy so unmistakably erroneous that the majority of their own party could no longer live with it.\n\nThe pattern on display in Kansas has recurred over and over in Republican politics for more than a quarter century. (In this sense the state is, like Norquist said in 2015 but now denies, a model.) The pattern has four steps:\n\n1. Demand a program of regressive, debt-financed tax cutting.\n\n2. Deny or minimize the first-order effects of these tax cuts (reducing revenue available to the government, and increasing the incomes of rich people) and instead emphasize second-order effects: the tax cuts will trigger faster growth, and perhaps inspire legislators to reduce spending. Both these speculative effects will, the tax cutters assure the skeptics, prevent the predicted deficits from materializing.\n\n3. Deficits in fact materialize when the predicted second-order effects fail.\n\n4. Insist the tax cuts only failed because weak-minded legislators did not do their part to cut spending as required. Continue advocating regressive, debt-financed tax cuts.\n\nKansas fits the pattern perfectly. When Brownback passed his plan in 2012, enthusiasts dismissed fiscal skeptics. (Wall Street Journal editorial page, 2012: “The tax cut will force state politicians to restrain spending.”) When massive deficits appeared, the same cheerleaders blamed spending policies. (Wall Street Journal editorial page, 2015: “The real story is how unchecked spending, especially entitlements, can undermine tax reform.”) But weren’t the tax cuts supposed to prevent “unchecked spending”? Wasn’t this the very reason their supporters gave to discount the predictions that the tax cuts would create deficits?\n\nThe tax cuts, which were sold above all as a plan to yield faster economic growth, produced nothing of the sort. The state, which had been growing slightly faster than the overall U.S. economy before the tax cuts, grew more slowly afterward:\n\nOf course, the most famous example of the model is George W. Bush’s tax cuts. Conservatives overflowed with confidence that the Bush tax cuts would produce an era of prosperity, and that predictions of fiscal irresponsibility were doomsday nonsense. Norquist called Bush “Reagan’s son,” and insisted the tax cuts would drive down spending: ”The goal is reducing the size and scope of government by draining its lifeblood,” he said in 2003. When none of these things happened, the culprit was, of course, excessive spending. The Bush White House “didn’t focus on spending,” Norquist said in 2008. “They didn’t make it a priority. And this predates September 11. It just wasn’t on the list of things they were going to do.” Like Trotsky being erased from old Soviet photographs, now the hero of the supply-side revolution was revealed to have been a traitor from the very outset.\n\nWhat enables Republicans to persist in this charade is that duping themselves is not completely necessary. Many, perhaps most, conservative elites believe as a matter of principle that taxing the rich at higher rates is morally wrong. They consider the first-order effects of regressive tax cuts — the transfer of resources from the public fisc to “the makers” — desirable. Since most Americans do not approve of tax cuts for the rich, this requires them to focus on the alleged second-order effects. And it explains why they continue to support the policy even when those second-order effects continuously prove ephemeral.\n\nThe entire identity of Republican politics has followed this same four-step pattern. The GOP made the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 the centerpiece of its domestic policy platform. When the economic and fiscal goals of the tax cuts failed, and a cycle of miserable job growth culminated in a massive speculative collapse, the party rebranded itself as a new, austere rebooted version of the old thing. The failures of the Bush-era party turned out to be its deviation from conservatism. It had been corrupted and seduced by big spending. And now the Trump-era party is right back to where it was under Bush, following the same policies and insisting the result will be different."],[8,"Kezia Dugdale 'SYMPATHETIC' to Scottish independence in Labour U-TURN","David Martin met with the Labour politician yesterday, just one week after he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg said the UK “could cease to exist” after Brexit. Scottish Labour MEP Mr Martin confirmed he was no longer opposed to the idea of independence if Theresa May continued to push for hard Brexit.\n\nAnd he revealed he would make a “pragmatic decision” once the full impact of the European Union exit had been made clear. But he also claims Ms Dugdale, who once stressed her party would never support another referendum, was “not unsympathetic” to the cause.\n\nMs Dugdale has previously been outspoken on the issue of Scottish referendum, claiming her country still “bears the scars” of the 2014 vote. But it also seems she has flip-flopped from either side, unable to settle on a firm stance for her party in Scotland. In 2015, she pledged to respect supporters who voted yes in the first referendum.\n\nAnd just a few months later, she said it was “not inconceivable” that she herself would back independence to keep Scotland in the EU after Brexit. But she later backtracked on her comments, following a fierce unionist backlash. Mr Martin, however, said the Brexit debate has left him undecided on the independence issue. He rejected SNP leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s calls for a referendum in autumn 2018.\n\nBut he also urged her to wait until 2021, when “we’ll know the shape of the British government” and the impact of Brexit negations. He said: “If it was October 2018 I would still vote against independence because you would not have all the facts.” But he added: “If, by 2021, England has set itself on course to become a declining economy and Europe looks like it might still be a rising economy then it may be strategically more wise to connect ourselves to Europe, rather than England, in the longer term even if there is short term pain. “It’s too soon to make these judgments — but for me independence is no longer an ideological issue, it’s a pragmatic decision based on what is the best option for Scotland.”\n\nScottish Labour confirmed the party does not want another referendum, adding Labour MSPs voted against holding another vote recently in the Scottish Parliament. But they added if there has to be one then it should not take place until after Brexit. A spokesman said: “Kez and David held a long-standing meeting yesterday morning. “They are both firmly united in their opposition to the Tories’ reckless plans for a hard Brexit and share many people’s frustration with Theresa May’s approach. Kez recently wrote to the Prime Minister to call for the best Brexit deal for Scotland, on differential terms if necessary."],[8,"Why I’m no longer talking to white people about race","On 22 February 2014, I published a post on my blog. I titled it “Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People about Race”. It read: “I’m no longer engaging with white people on the topic of race. Not all white people, just the vast majority who refuse to accept the existence of structural racism and its symptoms. I can no longer engage with the gulf of an emotional disconnect that white people display when a person of colour articulates their experience. You can see their eyes shut down and harden. It’s like treacle is poured into their ears, blocking up their ear canals. It’s like they can no longer hear us.\n\n“This emotional disconnect is the conclusion of living a life oblivious to the fact that their skin colour is the norm and all others deviate from it.\n\n“At best, white people have been taught not to mention that people of colour are “different” in case it offends us. They truly believe that the experiences of their life as a result of their skin colour can and should be universal. I just can’t engage with the bewilderment and the defensiveness as they try to grapple with the fact that not everyone experiences the world in the way that they do.\n\n“They’ve never had to think about what it means, in power terms, to be white, so any time they’re vaguely reminded of this fact, they interpret it as an affront. Their eyes glaze over in boredom or widen in indignation. Their mouths start twitching as they get defensive. Their throats open up as they try to interrupt, itching to talk over you but not to really listen, because they need to let you know that you’ve got it wrong.\n\n“The journey towards understanding structural racism still requires people of colour to prioritise white feelings. Even if they can hear you, they’re not really listening. It’s like something happens to the words as they leave our mouths and reach their ears. The words hit a barrier of denial and they don’t get any further.\n\n“That’s the emotional disconnect. It’s not really surprising, because they’ve never known what it means to embrace a person of colour as a true equal, with thoughts and feelings that are as valid as their own. Watching [the documentary] The Color of Fear by Lee Mun Wah, I saw people of colour break down in tears as they struggled to convince a defiant white man that his words were enforcing and perpetuating a white racist standard on them. All the while he stared obliviously, completely confused by this pain, at best trivialising it, at worst ridiculing it.\n\n“I’ve written before about this white denial being the ubiquitous politics of race that operates on its inherent invisibility. So I can’t talk to white people about race any more because of the consequent denials, awkward cartwheels and mental acrobatics that they display when this is brought to their attention. Who really wants to be alerted to a structural system that benefits them at the expense of others?\n\n“I can no longer have this conversation, because we’re often coming at it from completely different places. I can’t have a conversation with them about the details of a problem if they don’t even recognise that the problem exists. Worse still is the white person who might be willing to entertain the possibility of said racism, but who thinks we enter this conversation as equals. We don’t.\n\n“Not to mention that entering into conversation with defiant white people is a frankly dangerous task for me. As the hackles rise and the defiance grows, I have to tread incredibly carefully, because if I express frustration, anger or exasperation at their refusal to understand, they will tap into their presubscribed racist tropes about angry black people who are a threat to them and their safety. It’s very likely that they’ll then paint me as a bully or an abuser. It’s also likely that their white friends will rally round them, rewrite history and make lies the truth. Trying to engage with them and navigate their racism is not worth that.\n\n“Amid every conversation about Nice White People feeling silenced by conversations about race, there is a sort of ironic and glaring lack of understanding or empathy for those of us who have been visibly marked out as different for our entire lives, and live the consequences. It’s truly a lifetime of self-censorship that people of colour have to live. The options are: speak your truth and face the reprisals, or bite your tongue and get ahead in life. It must be a strange life, always having permission to speak and feeling indignant when you’re finally asked to listen. It stems from white people’s never-questioned entitlement, I suppose.\n\n“I cannot continue to emotionally exhaust myself trying to get this message across, while also toeing a very precarious line that tries not to implicate any one white person in their role of perpetuating structural racism, lest they character-assassinate me.\n\n“So I’m no longer talking to white people about race. I don’t have a huge amount of power to change the way the world works, but I can set boundaries. I can halt the entitlement they feel towards me and I’ll start that by stopping the conversation. The balance is too far swung in their favour. Their intent is often not to listen or learn, but to exert their power, to prove me wrong, to emotionally drain me, and to rebalance the status quo. I’m not talking to white people about race unless I absolutely have to. If there’s something like a media or conference appearance that means that someone might hear what I’m saying and feel less alone, then I’ll participate. But I’m no longer dealing with people who don’t want to hear it, wish to ridicule it and, frankly, don’t deserve it.”\n\nAfter I pressed publish, the blogpost took on a life of its own. Years later, I still meet new people, in different countries and different situations, who tell me that they have read it. In 2014, as the post was being linked to all over the internet, I braced myself for the usual slew of racist comments. But the response was so markedly different that it surprised me.\n\nI was three years old when the black student Stephen Lawrence was murdered, and I was 22 when two of his killers were convicted and jailed. Stephen’s mother Doreen Lawrence’s struggle for justice stretched out alongside the timeline of my childhood. Reports of the case were some of the only TV news bulletins I remember absorbing as a child. A vicious racist attack, a black boy stabbed and bleeding to death, a mother desperate for justice. His death haunted me. I began to lose faith in the system.\n\nI used to have a feeling, a vague sense of security in the back of my mind, that if I returned home one day to find my belongings ransacked and my valuables gone, I could call the police and they would help me. But if this case taught me anything, it was that there are occasions when the police cannot be trusted to act fairly.\n\nOn the evening of 22 April 1993, 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence left his uncle’s house in Plumstead, south-east London, with his friend Duwayne Brooks. As the two friends waited at a bus stop, Lawrence started crossing the road to see if the bus was coming. He didn’t make it to the other side. He was confronted by a gang of young white men around his age, who surrounded him as they approached. Lawrence was set upon, and stabbed repeatedly. Brooks fled, and Lawrence followed, running more than 100 metres before collapsing. He bled to death on the road.\n\nA day after Lawrence’s death, a letter listing the names of the people who turned out to be the top suspects in the case was left in a telephone box near the bus stop. In the following months, that letter led to surveillance and arrests. Two people were charged. But by the end of July 1993, all the charges against them had been dropped. The Metropolitan police had concluded that evidence from Brooks, the only witness to the crime, was not reliable.\n\nFour years later, an inquest delivered a verdict of unlawful killing in an “unprovoked racist attack”. After an official representation to the Police Complaints Authority from Lawrence’s parents, the Kent police force was tasked with launching an investigation into the Met’s conduct, in March 1997. The result, nine months later, would find “significant weaknesses, omissions and lost opportunities” in the way the Met dealt with the investigation of Stephen Lawrence’s death.\n\nIn July 1997, Jack Straw, who was then home secretary, announced that there would be a judicial inquiry into Lawrence’s death and the subsequent Met investigation. It was to be chaired by the high court judge Sir William Macpherson.\n\nThe Macpherson report was published in February 1999. It concluded that the investigation into the death of Stephen Lawrence “was marred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership by senior officers”. This institutional racism, the report explained, is “the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.”\n\nMost importantly, the report described institutional racism as a form of collective behaviour, a workplace culture supported by a structural status quo, and a consensus often excused and ignored by authorities. Among its many recommendations, the report suggested that the police force boost its black representation, and that all officers be trained in racism awareness and cultural diversity.\n\nKent police’s deputy chief constable Bob Ayling spoke to the BBC’s Newsnightprogramme that month, calling the Met’s original investigation into Lawrence’s death “seriously flawed”. Another key witness had come forward, Ayling revealed, but his testimony had been dismissed. Three phone calls had been made to the police by a woman who was believed to be close to one of the suspects, but her statements were not adequately followed up.\n\nA review of forensic evidence eventually led to a new trial of those suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence. On 4 January 2012, 19 years after Lawrence’s death, two out of the five suspected men were finally found guilty and sentenced for his murder. When Gary Dobson and David Norris killed Lawrence, they were teenagers. By the time they were jailed, they were adult men, in their mid- to late 30s. While Stephen Lawrence’s life ended at 18, theirs had continued, unhindered, in part aided by the police.\n\nBoth men received life sentences. When passing the sentence, Mr Justice Treacy described the crime as a “murder which scarred the conscience of the nation”. It was a monumental day for Britain, and long overdue. Many were left wondering how the police had failed so catastrophically, and why justice took so long to come.\n\nFor so long, the bar of racism has been set by the activity of white nationalists. Extremists are always roundly condemned by the big three political parties. The reactionary white pride sentiment, so often positioned in opposition to social progress, has never really gone away. It manifests in groups such as the National Front, the British National party and the English Defence League. Their political activity, whether it is storming down busy city streets in hoodies and balaclavas, or suited up and feigning respectability at their political conferences, has real-life consequences for people who are not white.\n\nIf all racism was as easy to spot and denounce as white extremism is, the task of the anti-racist would be simple. People feel that if a racist attack has not occurred, or the word “nigger” has not been uttered, an action can’t be racist. If a black person hasn’t been abused or spat at in the street, it’s not racist. But racism thrives in places where those in charge do not align themselves with white extremist politics. The problem must run deeper.\n\nWe tell ourselves that good people can’t be racist. We seem to think that true racism only exists in the hearts of evil people. We tell ourselves that racism is about moral values, when instead it is about the survival strategy of systemic power. When a large proportion of the population votes for politicians and political efforts that explicitly use racism as a campaigning tool, we tell ourselves that such huge sections of the electorate simply cannot be racist, as that would render them heartless monsters. But this isn’t about good and bad people.\n\nThe covert nature of structural racism is difficult to hold to account. It slips out of your hands. You can’t spot it as easily as a St George’s flag and a bare belly at an English Defence League march. It’s much more respectable than that.\n\nI choose to use the word “structural” rather than “institutional” because I think it is built into spaces much broader than our more traditional institutions. Thinking of the big picture helps you see the structures. Structural racism is dozens, or hundreds, or thousands of people with the same biases joining together to make up one organisation, and acting accordingly. Structural racism is an impenetrably white workplace culture set by those people, where anyone who falls outside the culture must conform or face failure. “Structural” is often the only way to describe what goes unnoticed – the silently raised eyebrows, the implicit biases, snap judgments made on assumptions of competency.\n\nIn the same year I decided to no longer talk to white people about race, the British social attitudes survey recorded a significant increase in the number of people who were happy to admit their own racism. The sharpest rise, according to a Guardian report, was among “white, professional men between the ages of 35 and 64, highly educated and earning a lot of money”.\n\nThis is what structural racism looks like. It is not just about personal prejudice, but the collective effects of bias. It is the kind of racism that has the power to drastically affect people’s life chances. These highly educated, high-earning white men are very likely to be in positions that influence others’ lives – teaching, prosecuting, examining college applicants and hiring staff. They are almost certainly the kind of people who set workplace cultures.\n\nThey are unlikely to boast about their politics with colleagues or acquaintances because of the social stigma attached to holding racist views. Their racism is covert. It doesn’t reveal itself in spitting at strangers in the street. Instead, it lies in an apologetic smile while telling a non-white employee that they didn’t get the promotion. It manifests itself in a CV tossed in the bin because the applicant has a foreign-sounding name. Racism is woven into the fabric of our world. This demands a collective redefinition of what it means to be racist and what we must do to end it.\n\nThere is much evidence to show that your life chances are impeded if you are black in Britain. Between 2010-11, the Department for Education found that a black schoolboy in England was three times more likely to be permanently excluded from school, compared to the whole school population. Black school leavers were less likely to be accepted into a high-ranking Russell Group university than their white counterparts. In 2009, a study by the Department for Work and Pensions found that applications for jobs to a number of prospective employers were not treated equally: applicants with white-sounding names were called to interview far more often than those with African- or Asian-sounding names. Despite this, many insist that any attempt to level the playing field is special treatment.\n\nInstead of being seen as a solution to a systemic problem, positive discrimination is frequently singled out as one of the signs of “political correctness gone mad”. Quotas introduced to balance unequal representation are usually bitterly contested. The method works a little bit like this: senior people in an organisation realise their workplace doesn’t reflect the reality of the world they live in (either because of internal or external pressure), so they implement recruitment strategies to redress the balance. Quotas have been suggested in many sectors, from politics to sport and theatre, and they are always followed by a backlash.\n\nIn 2002, the National Football League introduced measures to address the lack of black managers in American football. Named after the NFL’s diversity committee chair Dan Rooney – who died in April this year – the Rooney rule worked through a rather mild method of opening up opportunities for people of colour. When a senior coaching or operations position became available, teams were required to interview at least one black or minority ethnic person for the job. This was a shortlist requirement only. Teams were under no obligation to hire that person. The rule wasn’t a quota. Neither was it enforcing an all-black shortlist, or a rigid percentage target. Instead, it was a “softly-softly” attempt to rebalance the scales. The Rooney rule was implemented a year after it was introduced. A decade after the rule’s implementation, evidence showed that it was working. In those years, 12 new black coaches had been hired across the US, and 17 teams had been led by either a black or Latino coach, some even in quick succession. The general consensus was that the sport’s bosses had begun to see candidates that they wouldn’t have previously considered.\n\nAround the time of the rule’s 10th birthday, its success in the US led to the idea being floated in British football. For some football bosses, it was a good way to finally leave the sport’s racist past behind, a way to heal the wounds caused by monkey noises and bananas thrown at black players. Greg Dyke, then chairman of the Football Association, confirmed to the BBC in 2014 that the FA’s inclusion advisory board was considering instituting some version of the rule. In British football, as of 2015, the statistics were pitiful. Despite black and minority ethnic players accounting for 25% of those in both divisions, there was only one black manager in the Premier League, and just six black managers in the English Football League. There were no black managers in Scotland’s top four divisions, and just one in the Premier League in Wales.\n\nStill, the thought of implementing the Rooney rule in British football sent the nation into a spin. Karl Oyston, the chairman of Blackpool FC, called it “tokenism” and “an absolute insult”. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, introduced plans to develop a pool of black top-flight coaches instead, and called the Rooney rule unnecessary. The way it was spoken about, you would have thought that the FA was asking club owners to walk into their local supermarket and offer their highest-level jobs to the first black person they saw in the vegetable aisle. In 2016, the English Football League put forward proposals to make implementation of the Rooney rule mandatory. The Premier League chose not to entertain the idea – even on a voluntary basis.\n\nAround the same time as Britain was debating the Rooney rule, a similar debate was taking place in the country’s boardrooms. Research in 2014 by an executive recruitment company found that more than half of FTSE 100 companies didn’t have a single person of colour at board level. In response, the then business secretary, Vince Cable, announced an optimistic plan to ensure that in just five years 20% of FTSE 100 directors would be from black and minority ethnic backgrounds.\n\nIn 2015, a London School of Economics report called for gender quotas in all senior public and private positions. When a survey in the same year showed that less than 20% of senior managers in the City of London were female, women in the financial sector began calling for quotas to tackle the problem. Similarly, in a 2013 survey, more than half of women working in construction – many of whom were employed by companies in which women accounted for just 10% of the workforce – supported the idea of quotas.\n\nBut when it comes to race, the language is much less definitive. Instead of quotas – the progress of which can be easily statistically measured – the solutions posed are vague. In 2015, the head of Ofsted suggested that a programme of positive discrimination be applied to teaching recruitment, stressing that the ethnic mix of teachers in a given school should reflect that of its pupils. When he was head of the Greater Manchester police, Sir Peter Fahy called for a change in equality legislation so that police constabularies could use positive discrimination when hiring black police officers – he was sure to let it be known that it wasn’t about “targets”. The problem is that when there are no hard targets for programmes of positive discrimination, they will always run the risk of looking like they’re doing something without achieving much at all.\n\nPositive discrimination initiatives are often vehemently opposed. Whenever I am invited to speak in panel discussions about race and representation, issues of meritocracy and quotas tend to be high on the audiences’ agenda. The main questions asked are: do quotas mean that women and people of colour are receiving special treatment denied to others, and shouldn’t we just judge candidates on merit alone? The prevailing view is that majority-white leaders in any industry have got there through sheer hard work alone.\n\nAt the core of such opposition is the belief that positive discrimination just isn’t fair – that whiteness isn’t, in and of itself, a leg-up in the world. But, if it isn’t, how do you explain the glut of middle-aged white men clogging the upper echelons of most professions? We do not live in a meritocracy, and to pretend that simple hard work is enough to elevate everyone to success is an exercise in wilful ignorance.\n\nOpposing positive discrimination based on the fear of not getting the right people for the right jobs inadvertently reveals what you think talent looks like, the kind of person you think it resides within. If the current system worked correctly and hiring practices were genuinely successful, our workplaces would appear very different from how they do now.\n\nThere was once a time when even I thought that efforts to increase black representation were suspicious. I didn’t understand why there was a need for them. I could never understand why, when I was growing up, my mum told me to work twice as hard as my white counterparts. As far as I was concerned, we were all the same. When she forwarded me an application form for a diversity scheme at a national newspaper while I was at university, I felt angry, indignant and ashamed. At first I resisted applying for it at all. I felt that if I was going to compete with my white peers, I wanted to do it on a level playing field. After some cajoling on her part, though, I applied, got through to the interview stage, and eventually landed the internship.\n\nAt the time, internship schemes looking for black and minority ethnic participants seemed unfair to me, but once I got through the door, I realised why they were necessary: any black people I saw were far more likely to be doing the catering or cleaning than setting the news agenda.\n\nStructural racism is about how Britain’s relationship with race infects and distorts equal opportunity. I think that we, as a nation, placate ourselves with the concept of meritocracy, and by insisting that we just don’t see race. This makes us feel progressive. But to claim not to see race is to demand compulsory assimilation. Colour-blindness does not accept the existence of structural racism or a history of white racial dominance. Indulging the myth that we are all equal denies the economic, political and social legacy of a British society that has historically been organised by race.\n\nMy blackness has been politicised against my will, because racism has given it meaning. This is a situation I didn’t choose, but I don’t want it wilfully ignored in an effort to instil some sort of precarious, false harmony. And, though many are happy to console themselves with a doctrine of colour-blindness, the huge differences in life chances between white and non-white people prove that while it may be preached by our institutions, it is not being practised.\n\nColour-blindness is used to silence talk about structural racism while we continue to fool ourselves with the lie of meritocracy. In 2014, I interviewed the black feminist academic Dr Kimberlé Crenshaw, who elaborated on the politics of colourblindness. “It’s this idea that, to eliminate race, you have to eliminate all discourse, including efforts to acknowledge racial structures and hierarchies and address them,” she said. “It’s those cosmopolitan-thinking, 21st-century, ‘not trying to carry the burdens of the past and you shouldn’t either’ [people].\n\n“There are people who consider themselves left, progressive and very critical, who have convinced themselves that the only way to get beyond race is to stop talking about race. By taking this stance, they align themselves with the post-racial liberals and self-styled colour-blind conservatives.”\n\nColour-blindness is a childish, stunted analysis of racism. It starts and ends at “discriminating against a person because of the colour of their skin is bad”, without any accounting for the ways structural power works in these exchanges. This definition of racism is often used to silence people of colour when we attempt to articulate the racism we face. When we point this out, we are accused of being racist against white people, and the avoidance of accountability continues.\n\nThe reality is that, in material terms, we are nowhere near equal. This state of play is violently unjust. The difference that people of colour are all vaguely aware of from childhood is not benign. It is fraught with racism, racist stereotyping and, for women, racialised misogyny.\n\nIt is nigh-on impossible for children of colour to educate ourselves out of racist stereotyping, though if we accumulate enough individual wealth, we can pretend that we are no longer affected by it.\n\nNot seeing race does little to dismantle racist structures or improve the lives of people of colour. In order to do so, we must see race. We must see who benefits from their race, who is affected by negative stereotyping of theirs, and on whom power and privilege is bestowed – not just because of their race, but also their class and gender. Seeing race is essential to changing the system.\n\nMain image by Ben the Illustrator\n\nThis is an edited extract from Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People about Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge, published by Bloomsbury Circus on 1 June.\n\n• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."],[8,"Thousands of children start school hungry, MPs warn","Thousands of children in England are starting school underweight, a group of MPs has warned.\n\nA report undertaken on behalf of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Hunger has revealed that an increasingly high number of children do not get enough to eat at home and are arriving at school hungry. \n\n“For a minority of children, the school lunchtime represents the only chance each day to eat something substantial,” the group reported. \n\nAt some schools, more than one in five children arrive to classes hungry each day, and for some children, their free school meal “may be the only hot food they eat each day”, researchers said.\n\n“In an age of rampant child obesity, there has been a shock increase in the number of children starting their first and final years of school who are underweight,” the group said in a statement. \n\nData from the National Child Measurement Programme for England last year showed that at least 6,367 children started reception class underweight – an increase of 16 per cent since 2012.\n\nAs many as 7,663 children started their final year of primary school underweight, up from 15 per cent in the same year. \n\nIn some cases, childhood hunger was “seen as part of a bigger picture of neglect”, but concerns have also been raised about poverty levels in a number of disadvantaged children’s homes.\n\n\"Some, maybe most, of these parents do not have sufficient income properly to feed their children,” said MP Frank Field, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hunger. \n\n“Whether the reason for this is a long delay in paying benefits to which they are entitled, low or irregular wages, trying to square previous debts… we do not know.”\n\nMr Field went on to say that there is not enough data to build a full picture of underweight children’s home environments, but findings suggested that “too many children have hunger as their most constant companion”.\n\nOne suggestion that came from the report was to discuss the possibility of using some of the proceeds from the new sugar tax to extend free school meals to disadvantaged children during school holidays.\n\nThe group also noted that many poorer families were not making use of the NHS Healthy Start voucher scheme, which allows for free milk, fruit, and vegetable allowances. Around one quarter of families who are entitled to the help scheme are failing to take up the vouchers.\n\n\"Something very troubling is happening and there are at least two forces operating,” said Mr Field.  “One is the breakdown in parenting, and the second is an increase in the numbers on a low income. It’s a tragedy if one of these strikes a child, but it’s an unbounded horror if a child is hit by both.\n\n\"How can the world’s fifth richest nation not know the extent of physical damage caused to its own children by a lack of food?’”\n\nAs well as a rise in malnutrition, the study found that a rising number of infants and pregnant mothers are anaemic. Previous reports have shown that an increasing number of people being admitted to hospital in an emergency were found to be malnourished.\n\nIn a speech on life chances in January, Prime Minister David Cameron proposed an \"all-out assault on poverty\" as part of social and economic reform.\n\nData collected 2011 for the House of Commons Library suggested that more than half a million under-fives were anaemic, the highest level in 20 years.\n\nFormer Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has accused the charity of “scaremongering” in its figures on food poverty.\n\nThe MPs say they are working with the United Kingdom Statistics Authority in a bid to obtain better data."],[8,"Jeremy Corbyn: 'Free movement of people will end after Brexit'","Free movement of people will end after Britain leaves the European Union, Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he vowed a Labour government would implement a “managed” and “fair” migration system if elected in four weeks’ time.\n\nIt comes after the party leader risked confusion over Labour’s immigration policy earlier this year after apparently backing free movement – one of the EU’s “four freedoms” – just hours before giving a speech in which he was due to say his party was not “wedded” to the principle.\n\nBut when asked by ITV’s Julie Etchingham what controls a Labour government would implement on immigration, Mr Corbyn said there would “fair” immigration but refused to be drawn on specific numbers.\n\n“I’m not going to put any figures on it,” he added. “Theresa May has done that for, this is now the third general election she has promised figures none of which she’s come anywhere near achieving.”\n\nPressed further as to whether there would be controls on migration, Mr Corbyn added: “Clearly the free movement ends when we leave the European Union but there will be managed migration and it will be fair.”\n\nIn Labour’s draft manifesto, which was leaked to journalists on Thursday, it appears the party believes it can retain the benefits of the single market and the customs union while ending free movement. They are “essential for maintaining industries, jobs and businesses in Britain” the party’s policy document states.\n\nBut the stance seems incompatible with the insistence from EU leaders that access to the tariff-free market requires a member state to honour the EU’s four freedoms – labour, capital, services and goods. These are non-negotiable, the leaders have said.\n\nWhile Theresa May has made clear her priority in the Brexit negotiations is to regain control of immigration and borders, recommitting to the pledge of bringing down numbers to the “tens of thousands”, Mr Corbyn has repeatedly said Labour’s priority is access to the bloc’s single market.\n\nIn the first of ITV’s 30-minute interviews with the leaders of major political parties, due to be aired on Monday evening, Mr Corbyn was also asked whether the general election could be the death of the Labour party.\n\n“The Labour party has its largest membership ever since I became the leader of this party,” he replied. “It’s active in every single part of the country. We’ve had the most unbelievable torrents of media attacks on individuals and a failure to engage in the policy debate.\n\n“This country cannot go on with its levels of inequality, you have to challenge the austerity programme. That is exactly what we are doing.”"],[8,"What connects Brexit, the DUP, dark money and a Saudi prince?","If Northern Ireland were a normal democracy, the election campaign would be dominated by a single question: how did the Democratic Unionist Party end up advancing the cause of a united Ireland through its support for Brexit? More specifically: what role did dark money play in that extraordinary decision? This story has all the makings of a John le Carré thriller but democracy on this island needs facts, not fiction.\n\nTo recap briefly: two days before the Brexit referendum last June, the Metro freesheet in London and other British cities came wrapped in a four-page glossy propaganda supplement urging readers to vote Leave. Bizarrely, it was paid for by the DUP, even though Metro does not circulate in Northern Ireland. At the time, the DUP refused to say what the ads cost or where the money came from.\n\nWe’ve since learned that the Metro wraparound cost a staggering £282,000 (€330,000) – surely the biggest single campaign expense in the history of Irish politics. For context, the DUP had spent about £90,000 (€106,000) on its entire campaign for the previous month’s assembly elections. But this was not all: the DUP eventually admitted that this spending came from a much larger donation of £425,622 (€530,000) from a mysterious organisation, the Constitutional Research Council.\n\nThe mystery is not why someone seeking to influence the Brexit vote would want to do so through the DUP. Disgracefully, Northern Ireland is exempt from the UK’s requirements for the sources of large donations to be declared. The mystery, rather, is who were the ultimate sources of this money and why was it so important to keep their identities secret.\n\nThe Constitutional Research Council is headed by a Scottish conservative activist of apparently modest means, Richard Cook. It has no legal status, membership list or public presence and there is no reason to believe that Cook himself had half a million euro to throw around. But the DUP has been remarkably incurious about where the money ultimately came from. Peter Geoghegan (sometimes of this parish) and Adam Ramsay of the excellent openDemocracy website did some digging and what they’ve come up with is, to put it mildly, intriguing.\n\nWhat they found is that Richard Cook has a history of involvement with a very senior and powerful member of the Saudi royal family, who also happens to have been a former director of the Saudi intelligence agency. In April 2013, Cook jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud. The prince, whose address is given as a royal palace in Jeddah, is listed on the company’s initial registration as the holder of 75 per cent of the shares. Cook had 5 per cent. The other 20 per cent of the shares belonged to a man called Peter Haestrup, a Danish national with an address in Wiltshire, whose own colourful history we must leave aside for reasons of space.\n\nPrince Nawwaf, who died in 2015, was no casual investor. He had been Saudi minister for finance, government spokesman and diplomatic fixer before becoming head of intelligence. His son, Mohammed bin Nawwaf, has, moreover, been the Saudi ambassador to both the UK and Ireland since 2005. When Five Star was set up in 2013, Prince Nawwaf was 80, had suffered a stroke and used a wheelchair. It seems rather remarkable that he was going into business with a very minor and obscure Scottish conservative activist. But we have no idea what that business was. Five Star never filed accounts. In August 2014, the Companies Office in Edinburgh threatened to strike it off and in December it was indeed dissolved.\n\nIt may be entirely co-incidental that the man who channelled £425,622 to the DUP had such extremely high level Saudi connections. We simply don’t know. We also don’t know whether the current Saudi ambassador had any knowledge of his father’s connection to Richard Cook. But here’s the thing: the DUP claims not to know either. And that is at best reckless and at worst illegal.\n\nArlene Foster told the BBC in late February that she did not even know how much the mystery donor had given the party. Then the party, under pressure, revealed the amount, but insisted that ascribing the donation to Cook’s Constitutional Research Council was enough and people should stop asking questions. Then, in early March, Jeffrey Donaldson told openDemocracy that the DUP did not need to know the true source of the money.\n\nBut this is simply untrue. The UK electoral commission is clear: “a donation of more than £500 cannot be accepted… if the donation is from a source that cannot be identified”. The legal onus is on the DUP to establish that the real donor was entitled to put money into a UK political campaign. If it can’t do that, it has to repay the £425,622. Since it has not done so, we have to assume it knows the true source is not, for example, a foreign government – which would be illegal.\n\nThe DUP has harmed Northern Ireland and endangered the union it exists to protect. How much did the lure of dark money influence that crazy decision? Any self-respecting voter would want to know."],[8,"Some Issues In Our Party Need Addressing. – Checking Reality","Vindicated is how I’m told I should feel, but I don’t.

These are members who paid to be part of our party and cleared our debts.  Some who found it hard to make ends meet but gave that £4 a month as they wanted and sometimes needed to feel they could be part of a movement that would help them become agents of their own struggle.\n\nThey were branded ‘cult members’, as ‘behaving like petulant children’ because they wanted to democratically choose an MP to be leader of a party proclaiming to be for the ordinary people and they dared to believe in a Politician who was interested in listening to their hardship. Jeremy was admired not by people who were stupid or brainwashed but because he was rare and they believed in the alternative he offered.\n\nThey were told  they were too lazy to campaign and put in the hard work, yet they came out in their thousands. In my CLP it was 2:1 new members who came out and our EC is now 50% made up of new members. They work their arses off.\n\nThey were branded naïve, patronised and condescended because they refused to believe that the party were not going to win UKIP voters if we didn’t bash immigrants like Stephen Kinnock or accuse Muslims of not assimilating and push the UKIP enlarging narrative of parallel lives.\n\nThey had to be taken to court because they joined a party that proclaimed to fight for their futures, and that court case was funded by their own subscription fees without any consultation with the membership on how our money would be used.\n\nThey were accused of throwing a brick through a window or spitting on college caretaker without any evidence and had to prove innocence after being called guilty by a right wing media presumably briefed by our party. Many of these accusations damaged the reputations, employment opportunities and lives of people who volunteered in our party and give so much. Yet not one apology has been provided. Yet not one person who spread such malicious lies has been reprimanded.\n\nThere have been members reported to their workplaces for expressing political views in support of Jeremy. There have been members with disabilities reported to the DWP for welfare fraud as they use social media to support our party. The threat to these people’s financial survival threatened in the name of democratic socialism.\n\nThey were suspended for merely liking a tweet from the Green party 3 years ago whilst MPs and others holding public office openly took to social media, print media, TV and radio to bring our party into disrepute with impunity. And continue to do so.\n\nEven in the last days of the campaign candidates were undermining all the hard work of members by running to the media to attack Jeremy and one even wrote a letter to voters – yet no consequences as different rules apply if you’re disloyal to a twice elected leader from the left of the party. And calls for unity are used as tools to manipulate the course of justice to plant the idea we are the ones who are unreasonable, sectarian and not interested in our parties future.\n\nOur amazing front bench were regularly attacked, publicly and disgracefully. Jess Philips openly telling the first Black woman MP to ‘fuck off’ with pride before she performed a coup on Dawn Butler another Black woman to obtain the position of Chair of Women’s PLP. This under the guise of Feminism! Yet we take the Black vote for granted in dozens of our constituencies including mine.\n\nWe saw 18 Jeremy supporting members in Ealing crowd-funding to legally challenge our party for barring them from standing as candidates in local elections. We saw young members in Harrow needing to go to court over their expulsions. Yet we’re expecting to believe these same people are going to pursue a manifesto on worker’s rights?\n\nWe saw Labour run councils push policies of social cleansing, demolishing of council homes, closing of services and cut the pay of teaching assistants with pride.\n\nOn our own ship we had our own people play the role of Judas better than the original. With passive aggressive attacks through social media guised as ‘expressions of concern’ or ‘advice’ they could easily have texted to Jeremy instead of writing about in The Guardian or on Twitter to 250,000+ people.\n\nRather than show some self awareness, they try and fool us by dumping the role of Judas rewrite history by painting themselves as leaders of a people led movement that gave us these gains by campaigning for the very MPs who have treated our members with contempt and with one asking for a fucking knighthood!\n\nWithout any shame, they’re now inviting MPs from the right to return to the front bench without asking anyone who fought this struggle daily if we’re OK with that. Who are they replacing exactly? Do you think we have your Judas genetics that we’re happy to dump the likes of Diane, John, Angela, Richard, Sarah, Cat, Rebecca, Kate, Barry, Emily et al who faced our struggle with us for who? For what position?\n\nIf you’ve not learnt when to shut your mouth now, you never will and you’ll continue to be a liability with your flimsy loyalty to any cause. To leave us when the going got tough, to step on our heads and pushing us deeper under water, you really believe you have a right to be on this ship rebuilt and held together with our blood, sweat and tears? More astonishingly, you actually have such a deep sense of misguided entitlement you have already unpacked your stuff in the first class suites and are trying to get your hands on the helm.\n\nIncredulous!\n\nWe have MPs on the right stating they’re happy to return, as if they were aiding Jeremy to do a better job? As if they’re entitled? As if they would have the capability to produce such a manifesto? As if they weren’t part of the problem pre-Corbyn that saw us lose so many seats, sell immigration mugs, promise to be tougher than Tories on welfare and create the work capability assessment that has bought misery to so many?\n\nDo you think the public want us to return to this? Have you not learnt anything?\n\nWhy do we need these people? What delusions do they have about their own ability? Why should anyone trust these MPs who took positions previously only to use it as a weapon against Corbyn resigning when they want to water down a policy that should benefit working class people. Even after the manifesto was launched they still had no understanding of what this meant to millions of people who are struggling in our communities.\n\nOur current Shadow Cabinet have done amazingly well, they outperformed their predecessors and they gave us a manifesto we would never have had created by others. They were not seat warmers waiting to be returned to sitting on the floor now the self-proclaimed, self righteous would like to play again. They are intelligent, capable, talented assets to our party who have earned their right to retain and embed themselves in their roles.\n\nUntil this party addresses the the fact our policies are not being put into practice by Labour local government and a national local government manifesto is now needed – nothing has changed.\n\nUntil there is an acknowledgement of how our members were treated and assurances that such attacks from MPs to our members will be acted upon with disciplinary action – nothing has really changed.\n\nI’m surprised many of our new members continued to stay with us and even more surprised they showed such loyalty to our party that they, the “dogs, trots and rabble” campaigned to help the MPs who attacked them so badly. For all they went through and to still have the humility and passion for our party, they deserve respect and protection. They deserve an apology.\n\nUntil people in our party who spent two years damaging our party by attacking our twice democratically elected leader and our members take responsibility and accept the role they played that led to us losing votes that could have been crucial – nothing has changed.\n\nUntil our current Shadow Cabinet are acknowledged with the respect and permanency they deserve and praised for their achievements, loyalty and resilience – nothing has changed.\n\nUntil the party see such behaviour from MPs, Councillors and Assembly Members and Mayors as something that requires managing and a robust disciplinary process – nothing has changed.\n\nNone of us could behave like this in any work situation, to bring your organisation in disrepute in such a vile, aggressive and personal way and get away with it. This is not Stalinism, it is basic rules most of us live our professional lives by.\n\nMandelson has already penned his cat-stroking instructions to his personality cult in the Mail on Sunday and Leslie already shown he a food allergy to humble pie. Round 3 has only just begun.\n\nWe cannot offer unity without having our demands met or the last two years have been wasted and we will find ourselves soon returning back to a place of abuse.\n\nThere have been some good that has come from this, we saw what class and calibre looked like when we saw John Prescott in action. John regularly gave many of us a voice and protection when we needed it. He did so by not taking sides, but by being the voice of reason that echoed what many of us wanted.\n\nWe realised exactly how low, vile, nasty and dirty people in our party are prepared to go. They chucked it all at us and we’re still standing. Our resilience built, our naivety quashed, our strength realised and loyalty tested. We now need to be confident in our own power and never sell ourselves short.\n\nWe learnt the strength, loyalty and talent of people like Rebecca Long Bailey, Cat Smith, Barry Gardner, Diane Abbott, Kate Osamor, Graham Morris, Andrew Gywnne, Debbie Abrahams, Andy McDonald, Ian Lavery, Emily Thornberry, Sarah Champion, Richard Burgon, John McDonnell, Angela Rayner, who stepped up against all the pressure and did the job, but also done it way better than we have seen in a long time.\n\nWe owe so much to their ability and strength to resist the temptation to join the bullies in the school toilets.\n\nWe learnt what strong and stable actually meant. There were many times Jeremy could have walked away but didn’t despite all they threw at him, despite the PLP meetings of group lynchings and constant cowardly bullying by a bunch of talentless morons (their word not mine), he got on with the job. Truly inspirational and it was this that won the hearts of so many and why he has been rewarded by our loyalty from day one.\n\nThe ball is now in Jeremy’s court – he can decide to build and change our movement for the better by using the position we placed him for real long lasting change. Or he can take us back without any change or lessons learnt and leave us all vulnerable to living in hope that the spots have really changed on those leopards, always sleeping with one eye open and hoping the public believe these people are genuine that they trust them enough to vote for us again.\n\nIf Jeremy does not take this opportunity to address some serious problems with our party they’ll still exist and we’ll not get to the destination we have stayed on this bumpy ride to reach. That would be a travesty."],[8,"For the families of MPs, elections can be fun but fraught with stress","I was seven years old when my dad woke me up in my bunk bed in the early hours of 2 May 1997 to tell me he had been elected as an MP. “And did Tony Blair win too?” I asked, before giving him a big hug and falling straight back to sleep. Little did I know this would be the first of three elections my family would have to endure.\n\nFour years later, I was a nervous first-year secondary school girl when my dad faced his second public test at the ballot box in 2001. I was so worried he might lose that I used my lunch money to phone him from the school payphone to ask him how people were reacting on the doorstep while he was out canvassing.\n\nElections can be a time of great uncertainty for the country, especially for the families on the sidelines, too, who are often forgotten by the ­outside world while they support loved ones who face a public firing.\n\nTo lose your job is a difficult experience for anyone to go through. But to lose it on a public stage where the whole country knows you have failed is humiliating.\n\nIt is just one of the reasons why elections can be a difficult time for MPs and their families – particularly if their seat is a marginal.\n\nMPs are offered no career advice or counselling if they lose their seat, and in most cases they do not have another full-time job to fall back on. Where their families might live and which schools their children will attend can hinge on the outcome of one fateful night.\n\nMy dad, Derek Wyatt, was the Labour MP of a marginal seat in Kent for 13 years, before standing down in 2010. I was always too young to attend the nail-biting count on election night, but in 2005 this turned out to be no bad thing.\n\nAt first it was declared that my dad had lost by 200 votes. But after two agonising recounts he was returned as MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey by just 79 votes – making his seat the second most marginal in the country.\n\nMy younger brother and I went to bed thinking our dad had lost, only to be woken by our parents a few hours later to learn he had won. We were allowed a rare morning off school the next day to watch the results on TV. But little did we expect to see BBC News using a screenshot of our own mum crying as the backdrop for the final results.\n\nFamilies of MPs often feel exposed – especially if they live in the local constituency – and this only worsens during elections. “You take a lot of flak as the child of an MP, and you just have to deal with it,” says Rachel Clark, 27, whose father Paul Clark was an MP for 13 years.\n\n“It’s horrible at times. Elections are interesting in the sense you get to meet lots of ­people, but it’s not fun when you’re leafleting and someone starts swearing at you and then rips the leaflet up in your face. That’s the bad side. ”\n\nRachel and her younger brother also experienced the same cliff-edge election night in 2005, when they thought their dad had lost his seat. Too young to attend the count but old enough to be left at home alone, they watched the results feeling terrified.\n\n“I remember feeling despair and worry and neither of us could sleep, so we spent all night watching what might happen,” she says. “We didn’t find out until six in the morning that our dad had won by only 254 votes.”\n\nIn the 2010 election, her father lost his marginal seat in Gillingham, Kent. By that time she was old enough to attend the count, which was a mixed blessing.\n\n“I don’t think anyone can be prepared to see their parents lose their jobs so publicly. It was really upsetting, I was sobbing on the floor. My dad was clearly heartbroken. I’ve never seen his face drop like that, and that’s what started me crying. I hugged him afterwards and said: ‘I’m still proud of you regardless.’ ”\n\nRachel’s mother had worked in her father’s office, and her family suddenly faced the prospect of neither parent having a job. “It was a very stressful period. And I don’t think people think about those who are behind the politicians – because they have families and friends who are affected by it too. It is a big event in their lives, just like anyone else ­losing their job.”\n\nMy dad agrees. “There are very few jobs where you fail in the public eye and it’s so visible,” he says. “If you have a marginal seat, the count is on TV, and they say ‘he’s lost’. They don’t see the human side, they just want the news. They don’t care about what you’re going to do next, or if you have a job to go to.”\n\nBut nothing can quite prepare you for the feeling of watching your parent win publicly either. At school, you become a talking point as the child of the local MP. And the great sense of pride you have for your parent is second to none.\n\n“When my dad won, we’d always go to dinner the next day and make him aware of how proud we were of him,” says Grace Allen, 20, whose father, Graham, is standing down as the MP for Nottingham North after 30 years.\n\n“I couldn’t imagine him not ­winning, because I’d seen him campaigning and I saw the connection he had with people. He’s from the ­constituency, loved his job so much and worked so hard. But we still always celebrated a lot when he won. I was always really proud of him.”\n\nGrace remembers election times as “quite fun”, stuffing envelopes in her father’s constituency office above a pizza shop with people who had worked with her dad for decades and had become family friends.\n\nFamilies tend to throw themselves into campaigning for their loved one, and election times can feel consumed by non-stop ­leafleting at every spare moment. Being so involved in the campaign can prevent you from worrying about what you hear on the news, or the latest opinion poll.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the ­election, my parents did their best not to let any anxiety trickle down to me and my brother. They had a motto, “win-win”, which they ­repeated every election day over breakfast before they headed down to the local polling station to cast their votes.\n\nLooking back, my dad regrets the level of scrutiny he put my family under, especially during election times. He says he would have never moved us down to his constituency if he had known the pressures we would have faced.\n\nHe somehow managed to show no anxiety in the run-up to his possible public firings. The typical gung-ho politician, he says he was always convinced he was going to win – despite having a target marginal seat. But beneath the bravado, he now admits he wasn’t so sure.\n\n“It was ‘win-win’, that’s exactly how I felt about it. But of, course, I didn’t really mean that. I said it, but actually deep down you went: ‘I’m not too sure about this.’”"],[8,"Gina Miller: ‘The dishonesty still goes on. That’s what I abhor’","Gina Miller took the government on over Article 50 and won. She suffered horrible abuse, and now needs constant security. But, she says, that won’t stop her fighting on – through tactical voting\n\nGina Miller glides into the office, bright, beautiful, bird-like. She smiles. “I’m just going to freshen up. I’ll be two minutes. Actually, one minute. It doesn’t take me long.” And she is back within the minute.\n\n“What a day!” the campaigner/philanthropist/fund manager says. The Labour party’s manifesto has just been leaked, her youngest daughter taken to hospital with asthma, and she has to prepare for a Brexit convention tomorrow. “I’m making the keynote. They’ve got Geldof, Gove, Alastair Campbell, and I’m like, ‘Are you sure you want me to make the keynote?! And they said: Yes!’”\n\nMiller is the uberwoman’s uberwoman. Is it true she only has four hours’ sleep a night? She laughs. “Last night it was two.” Outside the City, she was little known until last November, when she became Theresa May’s nemesis. Miller challenged the government’s right to implement Brexit without approval from parliament. Miller, represented by the City law firm Mishcon de Reya, won at the high court. The government appealed, but the decision was upheld at the supreme court in January. The picture of a triumphant Miller outside the High Court, proud as Liberty and flanked by a row of lawyers, was one of the defining images of 2016.\n\nSix months on, the 52-year-old is still fighting. She has raised almost £400,000 through a GoFundMe campaign to support election candidates opposed to hard Brexit. Miller hopes to “build the biggest tactical voting effort in UK history”. Critics have suggested she might actually bring about a harder Brexit by encouraging people to vote for moderate, pro-European Tories.\n\nMiller has a fascinating history – a privileged background in Guyana, tough times in Britain, three marriages, millions made in the City, and numerous tales about an earlier modelling career and the playwright Dennis Potter basing the eponymous heroine of his 1989 series Blackeyes on her. There is even a story that she was a Bond girl – of sorts. Some of the stories seem too good to be true.\n\nMiller needs a coffee, and heads for the silver jug in the office. I tell her I’ve had a whiff, and it smelt like a stale cigar. “Well, I like cigars! I actually smoke cigars. I used to be able to make them. I have a cutter in my bag, and whenever I go to airports they take it out. I had this comical scene once when they tried to find out if it was a weapon.”\n\nSlow down, I say. Who taught you to cut cigars? “My grandmother and then my father.” It is the first of many references to her father, who was Guyana’s attorney-general before starting a political party. “My father was a socialist, so we had some of the most extraordinary people at home. I can remember Castro coming to our house … the cigar smoke. I remember people talking, men in particular, about really important things. They were so passionate, and it was just so inspiring. I wanted to be like them. My father always said it’s about other people, it’s not about us. He’s a hero of mine.”\n\nWhen things got difficult in Guyana, Miller and her brother were sent to England. She initially went to the elite public school Roedean, but hated it and opted for a lesser boarding school. When things became even tougher back home, she worked as a chambermaid to pay for her education. Miller was a young Thatcherite, but began to think Thatcher’s brand of capitalism was cruel. “I see myself as a conscious capitalist. You have to respect what money and success gives you, then have the responsibility that goes with that.” She became a Labour voter. This time round, she says she’ll vote Lib Dem.\n\nMiller says she loved England, but never felt she was accepted here – too black and female for the establishment, too posh for those who supported positive discrimination. She dropped out of her law course at university after “a physical attack that was horrendous”. At 24, she had a baby girl, Lucy-Ann, who was starved of oxygen and has grown up with severe learning difficulties. Her family and her husband’s family wanted her to have Lucy-Ann adopted. She refused, and turned her back on her family for many years. When her daughter was three, she and her husband divorced. She was broke, moved into a single-bed flat, and for nine years brought up Lucy-Ann by herself, working as a marketing and events manager for BMW, then running her own marketing company and an investment conferences firm. Did she still feel privileged? “My strength of character is a privilege. I can do anything to survive. I don’t break easily.”\n\nHas she ever broken? She nods, and talks about her second, traumatic marriage to the financier Jon Maguire. “There was a point when I almost thought it wasn’t worth living.” She claims he was violent, while he has always denied this and said it was a difficult relationship because she drank. “I was drinking quite a lot because you just have to block out the pain. I had no idea who I was by the end.”\n\nAgain, she says she emerged stronger. “I decided nobody is going to see 100% of my heart again – no more men, no more marriage; I had my daughter, I was going to stay single.” Then in 2006 she met another financier, Alan Miller. She does not have a bad word to say about her third husband and business partner. Together they run the True and Fair Foundation (where we meet), which encourages the super-rich to give back to society. The Millers, who have two children together, also established the True and Fair campaign, which advocates for greater financial transparency.\n\nMiller has called herself the most hated woman in the City, claiming she is known as the “black widow spider”. Now she calls herself the most hated woman in Britain. You sense she wears it  as a badge of pride.\n\nOne thing that mystifies me is why Miller went to war over Brexit in the first place. Oh, no, she says, it’s nothing to do with being pro- or anti-Brexit, it’s about the point of law. Miller was going to bring the case with a few others, but they dropped out. “I said to the firm: ‘If I don’t stand up to this, what happens next?’ And they said that would be it. No case. And I just couldn’t do that with my conscience, to my children, my family. I said to my husband I’m going to be the perfect target – coloured woman married to a hedge-fund manager.”\n\nAnd she really didn’t care about the outcome of Brexit? No, she insists – but she did care about the lies being told about it. “And the dishonesty still goes on. That’s what I abhor so much. I’ve never been anti-Brexit. I’m anti-lies.”\n\nAfter the high court victory, the backlash against Miller was horrific. “I expected people to be nasty. I didn’t expect people to say I wasn’t even human, that I was a primate, and that I should be beheaded and shot, and people should be taking £5,000 bounties on my head.” Rhodri Philips, the 4th Viscount St Davids, appeared in court this week charged with making a racially aggravated Facebook post after writing: “£5,000 for the first person to ‘accidentally’ run over this bloody troublesome first-generation immigrant.”\n\nShe adds: “Other people took out Facebook campaigns to gang-rape me because ‘that’s what black bitches deserve’. The one repeated over and over is that I should be the second Jo Cox. One chap on Facebook said: ‘We will cut the throats of your children, make you watch and then burn you.’ Now I have security all around my home.”\n\nJesus, I say, why didn’t you just get the hell out? “People started sending me letters about what was happening in their lives. This young Polish woman who was standing at a bus stop up north was kicked to the ground. A grandmother wrote to me to say her grandson won’t go to school because he’s been told he’s a monkey and he should get back home. I get these all the time now, and they are saying: ‘Gina you need to be our voice.’ And when Mrs May did her election speech and said all dissenting voices must disappear, I sent a girlfriend in LA an email saying, ‘What do I do?’, and typical LA, she said: ‘Gina just get over yourself and embrace your power.’”\n\nNow, she says, the battle is more political than legal. I tell her I am confused by what she wants. Isn’t trying to get rid of hard Brexiteers just being a bad loser? No, she says, that’s wrong – it’s not the hard Brexiteers she wants unseated, it’s the hypocrites.\n\n“It’s the liars, the ones who are doing hard Brexit for deep and devious reasons. Gove, Johnson, May herself ... there is a hard-right element in the Conservative party that is gaining more and more power, and their agenda is quite simply low tax, low regulation, low social spending – and they make lots of money for themselves. They reap the benefits of everybody else’s suffering.\n\n“On the tactical side of it, because everybody is expecting a landslide, if we were able to show through our campaign that we got people to tactically vote and it brought the landslide down to a 20-30 majority, we would have done an incredible job. Lots of people say there’s no point. I understand that, but I’ve got to do something.”\n\nCan she understand why pro-leavers might not take kindly to being lectured by such a wealthy woman? She smiles, before tearing into the argument. “The message you’re then saying to me is: ‘Don’t go to school, don’t tell everybody to be successful because the minute you are successful, even if it’s by the toil of your brow, you don’t belong here any more, you have no right to speak up or to care.’ If the size of your bank account means you don’t have a heart any more, then Britain wouldn’t have been built.”\n\nWhat was the most important thing about her Brexit victory? “To be in the supreme court, the whole theatre, bearing in mind I studied law and my father’s a lawyer ... my son’s history teacher kept him behind one day, and he thought he was in trouble, but the teacher said to him, ‘Do you know your mum’s just made history?’”\n\nAnd the amazing thing, she says, is that it’s not the first legal precedent the Millers have set. In 2006, Alan Miller took his £5m divorce settlement to the House of Lords, arguing that his former wife didn’t deserve the payout after just a few years of marriage and no children. Miller’s face lights up. “He said to me: ‘If you tell me to stop, I’ll stop.’ And I said: ‘No way are you going to stand down because that means men in the future would have to pay for women’s lifestyles  – a woman who just sits there and does nothing. Of course you have to fight it.’” He lost, but the case still set a precendent.\n\nShe pauses. “It’s a funny thing. I did a talk at Oxford’s student union yesterday and one of the law professors came up afterwards and said, ‘I have to tell you something – me and my wife are now teaching two Miller courses’, because Alan’s case is taught in family divorce law and mine is going to be taught in constitutional law.” She giggles. “Alan always says, ‘Your case is bigger than mine.’”\n\nAs I prepare to leave, I ask about a couple of the other Miller tales. Yes, she says, as far as she knows, she did inspire Potter’s Blackeyes. And what about the James Bond story? She looks blank. “What James Bond story?” You know, the story that you are a silhouette at the start of one of the films. “Yeaaaa?” So it’s not true? “Yeah, it might be true.” Might be? “It is true.” Which film ? “I’m not telling you that. Again, it was all because of modelling. You went to all these parties. Girls get invited to all these things, and I love dancing.”\n\nGo on, which Bond film is it? “I can’t tell you,” she says giddily. Why not? She’s suddenly serious again. “Because actually the company has asked me not to say. They got bombarded when the first rumour came out. It’s interesting how often people have asked me not to say things. The model agency asked me not to say which one I was with. People are frightened of being associated with me in any way, shape or form.”"],[8,"Team Management Training from MindTools.coms","Conflict is pretty much inevitable when you work with others.\n\nPeople have different viewpoints and, under the right set of circumstances, those differences escalate to conflict. How you handle that conflict determines whether it works to the team's advantage, or contributes to its demise.\n\nYou can choose to ignore it, complain about it, blame someone for it, or try to deal with it through hints and suggestions; or you can be direct, clarify what is going on, and attempt to reach a resolution through common techniques like negotiation or compromise. It's clear that conflict has to be dealt with, but the question is how: it has to be dealt with constructively and with a plan, otherwise it's too easy to get pulled into the argument and create an even larger mess.\n\nConflict isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Healthy and constructive conflict is a component of high-functioning teams. Conflict arises from differences between people; the same differences that often make diverse teams more effective than those made up of people with similar experience. When people with varying viewpoints, experiences, skills, and opinions are tasked with a project or challenge, the combined effort can far surpass what any group of similar individual could achieve. Team members must be open to these differences and not let them rise into full-blown disputes.\n\nUnderstanding and appreciating the various viewpoints involved in conflict are key factors in its resolution. These are key skills for all team members to develop. The important thing is to maintain a healthy balance of constructive difference of opinion, and avoid negative conflict that's destructive and disruptive.\n\nGetting to, and maintaining, that balance requires well-developed team skills, particularly the ability to resolve conflict when it does happens, and the ability to keep it healthy and avoid conflict in the day-to-day course of team working. Let's look at conflict resolution first, then at preventing it.\n\nWhen a team oversteps the mark of healthy difference of opinion, resolving conflict requires respect and patience. The human experience of conflict involves our emotions, perceptions, and actions; we experience it on all three levels, and we need to address all three levels to resolve it. We must replace the negative experiences with positive ones.\n\nThe three-stage process below is a form of mediation process, which helps team members to do this:\n\nAcknowledge the conflict – The conflict has to be acknowledged before it can be managed and resolved. The tendency is for people to ignore the first signs of conflict, perhaps as it seems trivial, or is difficult to differentiate from the normal, healthy debate that teams can thrive on. If you are concerned about the conflict in your team, discuss it with other members. Once the team recognizes the issue, it can start the process of resolution. Discuss the impact – As a team, discuss the impact the conflict is having on team dynamics and performance. Agree to a cooperative process – Everyone involved must agree to cooperate in to resolve the conflict. This means putting the team first, and may involve setting aside your opinion or ideas for the time being. If someone wants to win more than he or she wants to resolve the conflict, you may find yourself at a stalemate. Agree to communicate – The most important thing throughout the resolution process is for everyone to keep communications open. The people involved need to talk about the issue and discuss their strong feelings. Active listening is essential here, because to move on you need to really understand where the other person is coming from.\n\nOnce the team is ready to resolve the conflict, the next stage is to understand the situation, and each team member's point of view. Take time to make sure that each person's position is heard and understood. Remember that strong emotions are at work here so you have to get through the emotion and reveal the true nature of the conflict. Do the following:\n\nClarify positions – Whatever the conflict or disagreement, it's important to clarify people's positions. Whether there are obvious factions within the team who support a particular option, approach or idea, or each team member holds their own unique view, each position needs to be clearly identified and articulated by those involved. This step alone can go a long way to resolve the conflict, as it helps the team see the facts more objectively and with less emotion. Sally and Tom believe the best way to market the new product is through a TV campaign. Mary and Beth are adamant that internet advertising is the way to go; whilst Josh supports a store-lead campaign. List facts, assumptions and beliefs underlying each position – What does each group or person believe? What do they value? What information are they using as a basis for these beliefs? What decision-making criteria and processes have they employed? Sally and Tom believe that TV advertising is best because it has worked very well in the past. They are motivated by the saying, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Mary and Beth are very tuned-in to the latest in technology and believe that to stay ahead in the market, the company has to continue to try new things. They seek challenges and find change exhilarating and motivating. Josh believes a store-lead campaign is the most cost-effective. He's cautious, and feels this is the best way to test the market at launch, before committing the marketing spend. Analyze in smaller groups – Break the team into smaller groups, separating people who are in alliance. In these smaller groups, analyze and dissect each position, and the associated facts, assumptions and beliefs. Which facts and assumptions are true? Which are the more important to the outcome? Is there additional, objective information that needs to be brought into the discussion to clarify points of uncertainly or contention? Is additional analysis or evaluation required? Consider using formal evaluation and decision-making processes where appropriate. Techniques such as Quantitative Pros and Cons, Force Field Analysis, Paired Comparison Analysis, and Cost/Benefit Analysis are among those that could help. If such techniques have not been used already, they may help make a much more objective decision or evaluation. Gain agreement within the team about which techniques to use, and how to go about the further analysis and evaluation. By considering the facts, assumptions, beliefs and decision making that lead to other people's positions, the group will gain a better understanding of those positions. Not only can this reveal new areas of agreement, it can also reveal new ideas and solutions that make the best of each position and perspective. Take care to remain open, rather than criticize or judge the perceptions and assumptions of other people. Listen to all solutions and ideas presented by the various sides of the conflict. Everyone needs to feel heard and acknowledged if a workable solution is to be reached.\n\nNow that all parties understand the others' positions, the team must decide what decision or course of action to take. With the facts and assumptions considered, it's easier to see the best of action and reach agreement.\n\nIf further analysis and evaluation is required, agree what needs to be done, by when and by whom, and so plan to reach agreement within a particular timescale. If appropriate, define which decision making and evaluation tools are to be employed.\n\nIf such additional work is required, the agreement at this stage is to the approach itself: Make sure the team is committed to work with the outcome of the proposed analysis and evaluation.\n\nWhen conflict is resolved take time to celebrate and acknowledge the contributions everyone made toward reaching a solution. This can build team cohesion and confidence in their problem solving skills, and can help avert further conflict.\n\nThis three-step process can help solve team conflict efficiently and effectively. The basis of the approach is gaining understanding of the different perspectives and using that understanding to expand your own thoughts and beliefs about the issue.\n\nAs well as being able to handle conflict when it arises, teams need to develop ways of preventing conflict from becoming damaging. Team members can learn skills and behavior to help this. Here are some of the key ones to work on:\n\nTo explore the process of conflict resolution in more depth, take our Bite-Sized Training session on Dealing with Conflict."],[8,"London attack suspect named, according to media outlets","London (CNN)The driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians near a mosque in north London has been identified as Darren Osborne, 47, a resident of Cardiff in Wales, according to multiple UK media outlets.\n\nOne man died and nine people were hospitalized following the assault, the latest in a series of terror attacks to hit the United Kingdom this year.\n\nThe driver, a white man, was wrestled to the ground by members of the public and then arrested at the scene, officials said. He was being held on suspicion of terrorism offenses, police said.\n\nEyewitnesses reported chaotic scenes as the incident unfolded just after midnight, when evening Ramadan prayers had finished.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said the attack was directed at Muslims and condemned it as \"every bit as sickening\" as deadly Islamist attacks that hit the country in recent months.\n\nNeil Basu, senior national coordinator for terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, confirmed witness accounts that the man found dead at the scene was already receiving first aid when the attack happened. He said it was unclear whether he died as a result of the attack.\n\nResidents in Finsbury Park had criticized authorities for not declaring the incident as terrorism soon enough, and police only announced they were treating it as terror more than eight hours after the event.\n\n\"This was an attack on Muslims near their place of worship and, like all terrorism in whatever form, it shares the same fundamental goal. It seeks to drive us apart and to break the precious bonds of solidarity and citizenship which we share in this country,\" May said.\n\ninvolving a vehicle as a weapon The assault comes on the heels of an attack at London Bridge, in which three men rammed a van into pedestrians and went on a stabbing spree at nearby bars and restaurants, killing eight people. Monday's attack is the third in London since March involving a vehicle as a weapon against pedestrians.\n\nEmotions are high in the UK in the wake of a series of deadly terrorist attacks and a fire at a London apartment building that killed dozens. Basu said it was a \"challenging\" time for London and that the emergency services were stretched.\n\nSaeed Hashi described how he fought with the driver, and how he and two others held him to the ground for 10 minutes as they waited for police to arrive.\n\nThe van used in the attack bears the logo and phone number for Pontyclun Van Hire in south Wales. CNN spoke to a man at the company, who said he was the owner but declined to give his name.

That includes 76 people who died, they said.\n\nStearns said if he was a victim, he would have wanted the maximum sentence, as some had advocated. He said he spent the weekend reviewing statements from the victims.\n\n“The most common word that repeats itself is pain,” he said.\n\nBut Stearns said he could not allow outrage to interfere with reaching a fair sentence. Some victims expressed disappointment.\n\n“It’s a slap in the face,” said Dawn Elliott, an Indiana woman who received steroid injections and was subsequently bedridden for over a year.\n\nCadden’s lawyers sought only three years in prison. In court, he tearfully apologized.\n\n“As head of a company that made drugs that killed and sickened these people, I say with full sincerity that it breaks my heart to read about how painful their deaths were,” he said.\n\nCadden was one of 14 people tied to Framingham, Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center (NECC) indicted in 2014 following the outbreak. He was one of only two people to face second-degree murder charges.\n\nProsecutors said Cadden, the head pharmacist, ran NECC as a criminal enterprise that sold substandard and non-sterile drugs produced in filthy conditions and shipped to medical facilities nationally.\n\nThey said Cadden directed the shipment of thousands of vials of contaminated steroids often prescribed for back pain despite knowing they were made in unsafe conditions.\n\nCadden denied wrongdoing. His lawyers said he never intended to sell contaminated drugs.\n\nVictims include Penny Laperriere, whose husband Lyn died after receiving a steroid shot. She told Stearns that what Cadden did was “unforgivable.”\n\n“Who gave him the right to play God?” the Michigan woman said."],[8,"The Vulgar Art of Liberal Narcissism","Joan Didion began covering political campaigns in 1988. By then, she had switched to being a Democrat, which did little to change her views of the world or change her life in any tangible way. This made her incredibly skeptical about America’s two-party system. Back then, she noted that, “[T]he political process had become perilously remote from the electorate it was meant to represent. It was also clear in 1988 that the decision of the two major parties to obscure any possible perceived distinction between themselves…” was done purposefully in the hopes of appealing to a small niche of “target voters,” and had “imposed incredible strain on the basic principle [...] of assuring the nation’s citizens a voice in its affairs.”\n\nThe poverty of distinction was, in other words, intentional. Bill Clinton embodied this tendency, especially when it came to his domestic policies. Let’s take two important examples that seem to be ripped from the GOP party platform. First, his infamous repeal of the Glass-Steagal regulation that brought us the 2007 financial crisis, absolutely ravaged the middle and working classes, and nearly ended the world economy. Second, in 1992, he ran as a “tough on crime,” “law and order democrat.” His 1994 Crime Act, of “superpredator” fame, was a disaster for the black community and for the criminal justice system. As Keanga-Yamahtta Taylor writes:\n\nClinton lobbied for his legislation in the same Memphis church where King had given his last speech the day before he was assassinated. Clinton’s pulpit speech demonstrated the tremendous shift in racial politics. King had used that pulpit to support poor Black maintenance workers attempting to unionize; Clinton used it to ask Black people to support expanding the death penalty. Clinton claimed to be using the words he assumed King would say if he were alive to deliver the speech himself: ‘I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people. I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandonment.’\n\nAn appalling statement and a merciless policy. As a result, we have 4.4% of the world’s population and 22% of its prisoners. The human cost has been incredible, the drain on the state unbearable. By 2015, Clinton would admit it was a horrible mistake even if he didn’t fully understand why. With Clinton’s presidency, we had finally arrived in the era of the Third Way consensus, the “post-political” and “post-ideological” era (Obama, of course, would complete the third part of this trinity: the “post-racial”). This political consensus created new challenges for the media. After all, if there’s little difference between Democrats and Republicans, why bother? The horse race of electoral politics, especially for the media, needs to showcase the difference. And it can’t look vague.\n\nIn 1996, the recently deceased elephantine orb of Elmer’s Glue, friend of Rachel Maddow, and former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes took over the network. He cultivated an incredible propaganda machine dedicated to scaremongering senior citizens into thinking gender neutral bathrooms are the first step towards sharia law. Ailes’ monstrosity has been disastrous for modern life. It is hard to name anyone else so successful in polarizing the country, especially given that he started off at a time notable for its political blandness. His network also created a backlash in the liberal media. In response, the liberal media catered to the dumbest, pettiest, most self-congratulatory parts of their viewership. They created a culture of smug narcissists, and narcissists fiend on two compulsions: short term ego boosts, and shitting on other people. More clinically, ingratiation and aggression. That’s called narcissistic supply. And it’s not just a habit. It is a need.\n\nTo get their fix liberals tuned into The Daily Show, MSNBC, or the Aristotelian quaalude that is Aaron Sorkin’s The Newsroom. Each monologue, each snide quip about NASCARnation was meant to affirm the viewers’ sense that they felt the right feelings, saw the world the right way, and, most importantly, weren’t hateful slobs who refused to floss their only tooth while singin’ the songs of that old time religion. Never mind that most liberal policies are now built around marshalling state violence to immiserate and discipline minorities and working class whites, or marshalling state violence to needlessly carpet-bomb the Middle East or go Zero Dark Thirty on some children (remember: consensus!). This largely took the aesthetic form of lectureporn. It is the apex of narcissistic supply delivery.\n\nSo what is lectureporn? It is the media spectacle of a lecture whose audience is the opponent of the lecture’s intended target. Jon Stewart, Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee, Keith Olberman, Rachel Maddow (again, friend of Roger Ailes), Aaron Sorkin, and a whole host of others have built their careers on this form. Lectureporn pulls off an amazing trick: it simultaneously delivers both elements of narcissistic supply. You sit and watch someone ingratiate themselves to you while they eviscerate someone you don’t like who is, in turn, unlikely to watch said lecture.\n\nWe’ve all seen the the moment when one of these well-coiffed smirks turns to camera three and says, “And I’m talking to you, Red America. You whine so much about taxes and welfare and yet you’re the ones that suck up all that nanny state help. Well, I’ve got news for you. From now on, everytime you say ‘welfare queen,’ or ‘culture of dependency,’ we’re going to personally drive to your house and hold up a mirror to you and remind you that we, the blue states, make your lives possible with our generosity. Be grateful we don’t refuse to pay up because we actually believe in decency.” Or any time an Aaron Sorkin character starts a sentence with, “And by the way,” while talking to any female character ever. The whole point of lectureporn is to get off on a political opponent getting rhetorically owned by the best version of yourself. That’s what the media alleges to present: the best versions of ourselves.\n\nBut the problem isn’t just that lectureporn is snide, tedious, elitist, lazy, and naive—and it is. The problem is that it’s dangerous. It breeds confirmation bias and a lack of empathy—two things liberals saw backfire in 2016 after years of media class scoldkriegs. Confirmation bias is exactly what it sounds like. It’s the habit of looking at new information strictly in a way that confirms your beliefs. Everyone does this to an extent. But this is the “short term ego boost” part of the ingratiation in narcissistic supply. All you experience is media coverage that psychologically reinforces how you already feel and what you already believe. You feel rewarded for having all the right perspectives and feelings because you’re smart and worthy enough to understand how it really is.\n\nConstituents and politicians alike end up confusing the map for the terrain. It has real consequences. The book Shattered and the Netflix documentary Get Me Roger Stone have ended the need for post-mortems on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, so all I need to say here is that her defeat, taken with the fact that the Republicans are something like five state legislatures away from being able to rewrite the U.S. Constitution, highlight the danger of lectureporn and the narcissistic pathology it encourages.\n\nThere are more reasons for our present political reality than lectureporn, but lectureporn is without a doubt a contributing factor. It has shaped the liberal perception of the world. In the Bush era, I remember every arrogant suburban dad big on Monty Python and “REALITY HAS A LIBERAL BIAS”-type bumper stickers telling me they only watched The Daily Show, because it was the only real news out there. Even at 16, I knew that was not a good sign.\n\nThe thing that falls out of this kind of confirmation bias is a lack of empathy. Narcissists are known for being totally unempathetic, but this has a unique character. Bill Nye’s new show and the March for Science perfectly illustrate one of the fundamental contradictions of liberal ideology: the truth is both politicized and neutral in the way that science is alleged to be neutral. The level of cognitive dissonance here is incredible. There is no such thing as political neutrality. And this ideological contradiction creates a major problem: the fetishization of rationality. The fetishization of rationality means you think reasonableness paves the road to political office and, on an individual level, that anyone who opposes you is an idiot who can’t understand reality. Thus, you have no purchase on someone else’s perspective because you’re narcissistically invested in your own view—the “correct” and only perspective. Dissenters are just the unworthy. Matt Taibbi puts it like this in his piece about the rash of Democratic special election losses:\n\nThe unspoken subtext of a lot of the Democrats’ excuse-making is their growing belief that the situation is hopeless – and not just because of fixable institutional factors like gerrymandering, but because we simply have a bad/irredeemable electorate that can never be reached.\n\nThis belies an important distinction between liberals and conservatives, lectureporn and the ubiquitous tirade in conservative media. It’s the Nietszchean distinction between contempt and hate. You can hate an equal or someone with power over you. So conservatives hate liberals (hence their paranoiac victim narrative), whereas liberals have contempt for conservatives, which means they’re arrogant. Arrogant people are lazy in general and inept when it comes to empathy. If you can’t empathize with people, you can’t understand them. And if you can’t understand their worldview, you can’t hope to either win them over or defeat them. You’ve played yourself. No one cares if you’re right and ineffective. That’s called being an impotent loser. For all the talk about “bleeding heart liberals” who vote with their tears, they’ve proven to be staggeringly emotionally incompetent.\n\nNow, let’s go back to that part about thinking reasonableness makes ready the path to power. The lethality of lectureporn to political thought and participation is its misapprehension of what political power actually is. Regardless of whatever we think or feel about the GOP’s platform and its coterie of alleged rapists, bigots, and unfuckable sneers, they actually get what it means to gain, maintain, and wield power. In 2011, when the Republicans shutdown the government, everyone wondered why Obama couldn’t have his “LBJ moment” where he grabbed Boehner by the lapels and said, “And by the way, you son of a bitch…” and brought him around with sheer rhetorical force.\n\nBut even LBJ didn’t have an “LBJ moment,” as his biographer, Robert A. Caro reminds us. Johnson’s real power on Capitol Hill came from his access to a money pool that could make or break political careers. These grab-them-by-the-lapels moments known as The Johnson Treatment were, as Caro writes, “only tassels on the bludgeon of power.” Obama had no such reservoir of financial power. While he tried to grand bargain and concede his way to victory, the Republicans banded together to deadlock Obama’s regime through dirty tricks, voter suppression, gerrymandering, and intercine parliamentary rules. That’s political power—even if it’s corrupt political power.\n\nThe idea that rhetorical force can be equated with political force is a fantasy. Lectureporn perpetuates this fantasy. It is the ultimate narcissism to say, “We lost because they’re dumb. They are our inferiors incapable of grasping the righteousness of our cause.” If they’re so dumb, why’d you lose so bad? Let’s face it, the Democrats have been losing for decades. They don’t think it’s a bar fight.\n\nToo bad—it is. And bar fights only have two rules: punch hard and never assume the other guy’s gonna fight fair. That’s why it’s crucial to get people on your side. But in order to fight at all, it must be clear who and what you’re fighting for and who and what you’re fighting against. This is one of the major lessons to be learned from Jeremy Corbyn’s recent success in the UK general election. He made an honest and real distinction. “For the many, not the few.” It’s that simple. If you can’t make a real distinction between you and your opponent, you’re getting your nose broken for nothing and for no one."],[8,"Neurodiversity","Like many human characteristics, such as height, weight or shoe size, there is a natural variation in the anatomy of people’s brains. Many authorities now use the term neurodiversity to describe dyslexia, dyspraxia, autistic spectrum/Asperger syndrome and other differences due to this variation in the ‘wiring’ of the brain.\n\nNeurodiverse people have a range of characteristics and many are highly able, leading successful careers and holding positions of authority ­– for example, scientist Albert Einstein, inventor Thomas Edison, ballet dancer Darcey Bussell, crime writer Agatha Christie, architect Richard Rogers, inventor James Dyson, Apple founder Steve Jobs and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.\n\nMany managers, professionals and specialists represented by Prospect are neurodiverse and they too are often very successful. However, they also face many challenges, frequently because their organisations fail to fully understand their strengths and weaknesses and do not provide the working environment they need to succeed and flourish.\n\nA complicating factor is that because neurodiverse people have often needed to be of high ability to get as far as they have in their careers, they have frequently learned to compensate for many of the difficulties they experienced when they were younger and in full-time education. For instance, many high-ability people with dyslexia have above-average reading and writing skills. However, they still have the underlying traits associated with the way their brains are ‘wired’, such as problems with memory and difficulties with processing words.\n\nThis can mean that a lot of the information people find when they look for guidance relating to workplace issues affecting neurodiverse, able, Prospect members can be confusing or unhelpful, particularly as it is written with young people in education in mind, or those more severely challenged.\n\nIt is likely that many of these able people have not been formally assessed as dyslexic, or on the autistic spectrum, and if they have been, they may not have disclosed it to their employers. However work colleagues, managers and union reps who know something about  neurodiversity could consider it when they recognise some of the presenting characteristics.\n\nAlthough many neurodiverse people may not regard themselves as having a hidden disability, it can be to their considerable advantage that the Equalities Act 2010 (and previous legislation) recognises differences such as these as disabilities where they have a substantial and long-term effect.\n\nThere are many examples of neurodiverse people who have become successful and highly regarded in one job only to run into difficulties when their responsibilities change, before they have had time to develop new compensating strategies. Sometimes it can be seemingly simple things that lead to significant problems, such as remembering everyone’s name after moving to a new team.\n\nHumans have a natural variation in the anatomy of their brains – they have a different neurological make up, or ‘brain wiring’.  While most people can be described as neurologically typical, or neurotypical, a minority who show differences such as dyslexia are now characterised as neurologically diverse, or neurodiverse.\n\nNeurodiverse difference includes autism – which includes Asperger syndrome – dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nThese webpages aim to:\n\ninspire all with positive role models and examples; enable reps to assist employers to manage neurodiverse members to the benefit of both the member and the organisation; direct neurodiverse members to relevant support and sources of information; direct members and reps who may recognise neurodiverse traits in their colleagues towards relevant support and sources of information; assist neurodiverse members and colleagues – for example, following job or organisational changes.\n\nSome of you may also wish to listen to these BBC Radio 4 programmes:\n\nJohn Harris from the Guardian talks to autism specialist Professor Simon Baron-Cohen (17 February 2015)\n\nJohn Harris from the Guardian talks to university researcher Penny Andrews, who, after a difficult childhood and adolescence, was finally diagnosed with autism in her early thirties (30 November 2015)\n\nWe hope you will find the information you need here to help to make organisational changes to benefit our members, including those with neurodiverse conditions.\n\nEpilepsy is a medical condition which affects almost 1 in 100 people in the UK. People diagnosed with epilepsy have a tendency to have epileptic seizures. Unlike the neurodiverse differences described in these pages, epilepsy is not necessarily a lifelong diagnosis and doctors may consider that someone no longer has epilepsy if they go without seizures for a long enough time.\n\nThe TUC, in partnership with Epilepsy Action, has published Epilepsy in the workplace – a TUC guide, to aid trade union workplace representatives in supporting members with epilepsy. The guide was written for the TUC by Epilepsy Action and is based on the social model of disability, which means epilepsy is not seen as a barrier to work. However, there may be external barriers to accessing work in the form of ignorance, prejudice and failure by employers to make workplace adaptations.\n\nThe guide educates trade union members about epilepsy, and provides guidance on reasonable workplace adjustments and making workplaces epilepsy-friendly."],[8,"Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt & Bahrain cut ties with Qatar","The four nations have also broken off all land, sea and air contacts with the Gulf state, with Saudi Arabia accusing Qatar of supporting extremism. Later on Monday morning, Libya has now joined the original group and cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, its Foreign Minister Mohamed Dayri has confirmed. Bahrain blamed Qatar’s “media incitement, support for armed terrorist activities and funding linked to Iranian groups to carry out sabotage and spreading chaos in Bahrain” for its decision. A close ally of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain was also cutting air and sea contact with Qatar and is giving its citizens 14 days to leave the country. In contrast Bahrain and Emirates diplomats have been given only 48 hours to leave Qatar. Qatar has also been expelled from a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.\n\nAn Etihad Airways spokesman said the “airline will suspend flights to and from Qatar on Tuesday morning”, until further notice. In a further move, Saudi Arabia banned Qatari airlines from its airspace, while Abu Dhabi's state-owned Etihad Airways and Dubai's Emirates Airline said they would suspend all flights to and from Doha from Tuesday morning until further notice. The last flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha will depart at 02:45 local time on Tuesday, the airline's spokesman said in an email. Etihad said their flights on Monday will operate as normal. Qatar Airways responded on Monday morning saying that was suspending all flights to Saudi Arabia. Egypt has cut ties after accusing the Gulf Arab state of supporting “terrorist” organisations including the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's state news agency reported.\n\nThe agency added that Qatar's policy “threatens Arab national security and sows the seeds of strife and division within Arab societies according to a deliberate plan aimed at the unity and interests of the Arab nation.” Saudi Arabia said Qatari troops would be pulled from its continuing war in Yemen.  Qatar has provided its warplanes to carry out air strikes against the Houthi rebels. The kingdom accused Qatar of backing militant groups and spreading their violent ideology in an apparent reference to the influential state-owned satellite channel al-Jazeera. A Saudi news agency said: “[Qatar] embraces multiple terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at disturbing stability in the region, including the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS and al-Qaeda, and promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly.” The future of the US military base in Qatar will now come under question. The Al Udeid Air Base, houses the biggest concerntration of military personnel in the Middle East, with 11,000 people stationed at the base which is 20 miles southwest of Doha.\n\nSaudi football team, Al-Ahli, announced they have terminated the sponsorship deal between the club and Qatar Airways. Oil prices jumped after the alliance accused the wealthy Gulf Arab state of supporting terrorism. The price of Brent Crude - seen as the benchmark - rose 1.2 per cent on the news to $50.55 while US Crude was up by a similar amount - 1.22 percent to $48.24. Qatar has repeatedly and strongly denied it funds extremist groups. However, it remains a key financial patron of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and has been the home of exiled Hamas official Khaled Mashaal since 2012. \n\nWestern officials also have accused Qatar of allowing or even encouraging funding of Sunni extremists like al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria, once known as the Nusra Front. US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in a statement urged the Gulf states to stay united. He said: “We certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences. “If there's any role that we can play in terms of helping them address those, we think it is important that the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) remain united.” \n\nHe added that he does not expect the decision to sever ties to have a significant effect on the fight against ISIS. Mr Tillerson continued: “I do not expect that this will have any significant impact, if any impact at all, on the unified fight against terrorism in the region or globally.” The isolation of Qatar will have a knock-on affect on Qatar's hopes of hosting the World Cup in 2022. Kristian Ulrichsen, a Gulf expert at the US-based Baker Institute, said if Qatar's land borders and air space were closed for any length of time \"it would wreak havoc on the timeline and delivery\" of the World Cup. A FIFA spokesman told Express.co.uk: “FIFA is in regular contact with the Qatar 2022 Local Organising Committee and the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy handling matters relating to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We have no further comments for the time being.”\n\nThe announcements come 10 days after President Donald Trump visited Riyadh to call on Muslim countries to stand united against Islamists extremists, and singling out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups. Ms Ulrichsen said: \"It seems that the Saudis and Emiratis feel emboldened by the alignment of their regional interests - toward Iran and Islamism - with the Trump administration. \"[They] have decided to deal with Qatar's alternative approach on the assumption that they will have the (Trump) administration's backing.\"\n\nSome Egyptian banks have halted dealing with Qatari banks, four Cairo-based bankers have confirmed. Egypt did not say if the measure included a suspension of trade with Qatar, and the Trade Ministry did not immediately respond to questions on this. The four bankers said the halt to transactions with Qatari banks came on internal orders from management at their banks, and excludes the opening of letters of credit required for imports. Some banks have stopped accepting Qatari currency while others are halting some treasury transactions, the bankers said. Bankers at three other lenders said they had not received any orders and that it was business as usual so far. There had been no official communication to banks from the Central Bank of Egypt on the split, the bankers said. An Egyptian official confirmed that the central bank had not ordered banks to suspend transactions in Qatari riyals.\n\nThe Maldives Government issued a statement that read: ”The Maldives took the decision because of its firm opposition to activities that encourage terrorism and extremism.” Despite its reputation as a tourist paradise, the largely Muslim Maldives is struggling with a large number of youths enlisting to fight for Islamic State in the Middle East. Libya's eastern-based government has followed regional allies in cutting diplomatic ties with Qatar, its foreign minister, Mohamed Dayri, said. It blamed Qatar for funding groups that have contributed to Libya's current divisions. The Libyan move is largely symbolic because the government, which sits in the eastern city of Bayda, has little authority within Libya and is not recognised internationally. Qatar has not had a presence in eastern Libya for several years."],[8,"Strange Heart Beating","I can’t work any longer. I find myself at the entrance to the park. It’s the same park in which she died. The children are all at school and the weather is bad and the only people around are one or two desperate parents walking babies and a homeless man who sits with his body underneath a swing and his chin on the seat. Leda and I spent our first few walks in this park pointing at things, at birds and flowers, as if they’d been put there for us. However, we trod the same paths so often that I stopped finding it interesting. The smell of semen drifts up from the shrubbery, the specific stink of a species of flora that I’ve never got round to finding out the name of. It is, I realise, my first time entering the park since her death. I never understood the pleasures of walking the way that she did. I’m lazy. She wanted to get a dog, something loping and elegant, as generously limbed as she was, to keep her company. I refused because I don’t like to volunteer to pick up actual shit with my hands three times a day. I can see now what the appeal had been for her though. I need something to do while I’m here – I can’t amble along purposelessly. I feel paranoid and the skin under my shirt collar chafes every time I turn my head. Anyway I suppose it would have been Leda who would have picked up the shit. It’s dull to have regrets. I’m just a person who has made the mistake of staying alive too long.\n\nI sometimes accused Leda of being morbid because of the frequency with which she spoke of death, but she had been born into a family obsessed with mortality. If her lineage had been that of circus freaks then she would have been doomed to grow a beard or take up tightrope walking instead. The truth was that death was such an abstract proposition to me that the subject did bore me. Of course my parents died and I grieved in the usual fashion. I remember their funerals with some clarity. But the grief I had experienced was different, somehow, unreal. What luxury! A grief that allows buffet breaks.\n\nI pause for a moment to look at the map. I know where I am but not where I’m going. The sun filters in a sickly way through the clouds as it tends to do in this country. Like a light bulb in a glass of milk. I clench my hands in and out of damp fists in my pockets. Anxiety has started to creep up over my neck and my chest like something spilled, scalding me. I can hear a couple only a few metres behind me and of course they’re laughing – aren’t couples always laughing? The laughter is loud, obnoxious. They want to prove how free they are, how unhindered by grim reality. I stare at a sign pinned to the map that is meaningless now thanks to rain blurring the ink that once formed words (some plea for a missing dog or a ban on barbecues, something that was once so important that someone felt it needed to be printed out and taken to the park and pinned to the map, but is now just an ephemeral blue-green presence, signifying nothing). Then I start to walk with great long strides down the left fork of the path and through the dark huddle of some overgrown trees away from the couple and I walk past a kicked-over bin and a bench and up the little hill and I’m there all of a sudden. In front of it. The lake.\n\nI look up and then look away immediately. The policewoman has taken a seat beside me on the bench. She sighs and tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. She’s come down to my level to make me feel comfortable. She’s good at her job. She looks up at the park warden and smiles thinly and I can see the warden shaking her head. The warden points at me.\n\n‘He’s a lunatic.’\n\n‘I’m dreadfully sorry,’ I say.\n\n‘He fucking isn’t.’\n\n‘All right, well, let’s not get upset.’ The policewoman makes a gesture to the park warden. The warden is swearing too much and the police don’t like it when people swear. I see a fat-bottomed coot plunging head first into the grey water in the distance.\n\n‘Do they belong to the Queen?’ I ask.\n\n‘The swans. Do they belong to the Queen? Is that the trouble?’\n\n‘They belong to me! They belong to the park, I mean,’ the warden corrects herself, looking to the policewoman for reassurance.\n\n‘Actually I think the Crown still retains all rights to mute swans,’ the policewoman says, thoughtfully. She taps her pencil against her front teeth twice. ‘Look, I do need to take down some information. Are you feeling okay? Are you on any medication?’\n\n‘No. Yes. I’m feeling all right.’\n\n‘And what about this lady’s claim? Were you attempting to injure or kill the swan?’\n\n‘I don’t know, really. I just—’\n\n‘He was throttling it!’\n\n‘Something overcame me.’\n\n‘Did you take the swan by the neck?’\n\n‘No. It was too quick. I sort of grabbed it. I think I got its neck in my hand but then it just got away.’\n\n‘I see. And why were you grabbing the swan?’\n\n‘There was this couple laughing behind me. I never meant to come this way.’\n\n‘He’s a lunatic, Christ.’\n\nI turn my head. There are a few people standing nearby trying to see what the fuss is about. Among the gawping faces I recognise one peering down, and she says again, ‘Seb? What’s happening?’\n\nThe phone rang often in the days following Leda’s death but I had mostly ignored it. For some reason on this occasion I felt compelled to answer. Moved is the more precise word. My hand was moved by some force to pick up the receiver. I heard myself saying ‘Hello,’ that terrible sound. It was as if it echoed through catacombs before it reached my ears. It bounced from walls and gained some sick momentum. I said ‘Hello’ again to break the spell. The person on the other end of the line had said their hello at the same time and so we spoke over one another. Then I felt compelled to say ‘Hello’ once more, so as not to be interrupted. As I said it I realised it was ridiculous to say ‘Hello’ three times.\n\n‘It’s Anne.’\n\n‘Oh, Anne. Sorry for saying hello so many times.’\n\n‘Just checking up on you.’\n\n‘I didn’t hear you say hello, I wasn’t trying to interrupt.’\n\nIt is Anne, a colleague and friend of mine and Leda’s, a tutor in the art history department of something called Galleries (she couldn’t care less for pictures or sculptures, but is obsessed for some reason with the buildings that contain them), who stands over me now. She intervenes as I sit there, staring into the grey lake. She tells the policewoman that I am the husband of the woman who drowned in the lake. She places a hand on my shoulder and guides me to her car, and then she drives me to my house, and I make us coffee. She sits across from me. I remember I once saw her eat an orange during a lecture and juice had run down her fingers. She had wiped her fingers on her scarf and I had looked away.\n\n‘Put the cup down,’ I suggest, ‘it’s much too hot to drink.’\n\n‘I’m drinking it so as to have something to do with my hands,’ she says, ‘and so I don’t have to make conversation.’\n\n‘Ah,’ I say.\n\n‘Oh, all right,’ she says. She puts down the coffee and looks me in the eye and says, ‘How are you doing?’\n\nI say, ‘Fine.’ I smile, or rather I spread my lips across my face and do an impression of smiling, which has worked in the past.\n\n‘How’s the course proposal coming along?’\n\n‘Very well.’ I get up and look at the drinks cabinet. ‘Oh yes. Very, very well indeed. Very well.’ It’s a Giorgetti walnut Canaletto cocktail cabinet with gold leaf. We bought it in Harrods and it was ‘honestly the most beautiful thing’ that Leda had ever seen in her life. I take out a bottle of rum and hold it aloft. ‘RUM?’ I ask.\n\n‘Why are you shouting?’ Anne raises her eyebrows. She says that she will have some rum. I pour it into her coffee and mine. She says she is only having rum in her coffee to keep me company. I say that is fine even though I don’t care whether she keeps me company or not. After we toast with our mugs I try and settle back on the sofa but Anne is staring at me curiously and a little fiercely.\n\n‘Seb, you can’t murder every swan you see. You have to start thinking clearly.’\n\n‘Yes,’ I say, inhaling the sweet steam through my nostrils. I briefly imagine lying on a bed of dead swans. The odour molecules bind and transmit their beautiful information upwards. I close my eyes.\n\nI phoned the Samaritans a week ago. I was standing (or sort of leaning really) at the top of the stairs looking at the pattern of the wallpaper from very close up, which meant that with my myopia I was really seeing it for the first time – the grain, the way the colour of the leaves had been printed ever so slightly outside the line of the leaf. I said to the Samaritans that I ‘couldn’t cope’ and they had said to me ‘it sounds like you’re having a really difficult time over there’ and I had thought ah, but over where? On widower mountain where the winds blow icily over strange, hard fruits that used to be my eyes, my ears, my teeth, but that are now just marbles vibrating inside my skull waiting for a thaw to come? But all I said in response was, ‘Yes, I am, thank you,’ and the Samaritan said, ‘Oh, you’re welcome.’\n\nI wake in the morning with eyes gummed and sore. There’s a feeling I get when I’ve been drinking, a coldness that sets around my eyeballs. I’ve never been able to find a name for it, and nobody else admits to feeling similarly, but I have experienced it so many times that I know for sure it’s a result of drinking too much. It is my skull making itself known.\n\nI set about trying to leave the house and fail spectacularly. I end up at the kitchen counter with my hands over my head and bent forward as if I’m about to be taken roughly from behind. I’ve never explored that sort of thing properly. There was an evening when I was making love to Leda and she poked a finger noncommittally in that direction. I was terrified of enjoying myself so I screamed.\n\nI’ve taken it upon myself to learn more about her. Even in death, why shouldn’t I get to know my own wife? I’m unlikely to find a woman to interest me more. I take a trip to the library. It’s the first time I’ve set foot in the place, even though I signed a petition to save it. There are three other people in there, and they all seem to occupy space on a spectrum from mildly to considerably insane. One old man resides within the vast expanse of a sports jacket. It sits approximately six inches above his head, which cranes forward on a thin brown neck. A hooked and spotted nose sits prominently in the middle of his face, with delicate glasses perched on top. He excites a great deal of phlegm inside his throat intermittently and reads theNew Yorker, while his feet, which don’t touch the ground, kick euphorically upwards so that the entire table ricochets, sending the paper flying towards his face, which distresses him, which in turn sets him to exciting the phlegm inside his throat. It is rhythmic and greatly alarming, and I wonder how on earth the fat man lying on the floor beside him can sleep.\n\nThere is nothing in the library remotely to do with Latvia. Perhaps on closer inspection it would be wiser to let the library die. I wonder if I can unsign a petition. Instead I go online. I type ‘Latvia’, and ‘Latvian history’. I leave twenty tabs open while I reheat a fish pie. As I spoon the mashed potato into my mouth I think of something that the anthropologist Johannes Fabian once said: ‘Somehow we must be able to share each other’s past in order to be knowingly in each other’s present.’ I finger my credit card, the hard impressions of each number.\n\nI book my flight.\n\nI leave the house while it is still dark. The chill catches my breath and releases it like powder slapped from a gymnast’s hands. I catch the bus with people who seem awake, dressed, prepared. I feel somehow naked and ashamed. I’m carrying the largest carry-on bag that I can find: an old, curmudgeonly brown leather overnight bag that belonged to my father and that I insisted on using for trips much to Leda’s annoyance (and despite the fact that she bought me a new wheeled suitcase that had a sleek red carapace, and which I nicknamed The Ladybird and doomed to a life in the attic).The leather of the handles has become shiny over the years from being handled first by my father’s hands and now by mine. On the train to Gatwick the light pales and coolly silhouettes the branches of trees, thick mist rising among the legs of grazing horses. The sun eventually appears: red, completely round, severe and painful-looking, at the very edge of the sky. The country looks quiet and I am sorry all of a sudden to be leaving it.\n\nOn the plane people seem to arrive with full bladders and bowels – immediately there is a queue of six people for the toilet, which I am sitting close to. Their hovering presence at my elbow interrupts my concentration. An old lady leans heavily on my seat and says to nobody in particular, ‘I’m too old for this,’ and when nobody in particular pays any attention she shrieks, ‘I’m ninety-two!’\n\n‘Perhaps you should think about going on a cruise next year,’ I suggest, gently prising her blue little claws from my seat so that I can rest my head. She opens her mouth to protest but I can see that she’s perfectly able to support her own weight so I simply nod and close my eyes to dissuade her from carrying on. I’m very tired but unable to sleep. Glancing upwards I make eye contact with a large man who has joined the queue for the lavatory. In turn he grins at me as if neither of us is aware of the stink he is doubtless about to produce. On the screen in front of me I see the blinking avatar that represents us in the air on our way to Latvia. It seems so close, so ridiculously close.\n\nI listen to the hum of the engine, feel the cold breath of the air conditioning carrying a sigh from the front of the plane to the back. My newspaper lies abandoned on the tray in front of me. I can’t read for more than five minutes without coming across a word that somehow looks wrong, my brain playing tricks on me. ‘File’ I read, and think, surely not? File?\n\nThe stewardess comes and hands me my plastic cup full of ice, my concentrated orange juice, strangely thick. In my hands I clasp the thing that lay in the last envelope of all – a lock of, unmistakably, Leda’s hair.\n\nThere’s no right way to grieve. I know that because so many people have told me, but also because I’ve done my homework. Rachmaninoff, for instance, suffered badly from depression brought on by his loss. For three years following the death of Tchaikovsky in 1893, he couldn’t write a note. He recovered due in part to auto-suggestive therapy – one simply wills a thing to be and it is so. How sweet. However, in 1915 Rachmaninoff’s dear friend Scriabin died and this time he reacted differently. For many months he gave concerts solely of his friend’s music. What a lovely way to mourn; they asked for his repertoire and he retorted, ‘Only Scriabin tonight.’ I’d like to give other things thought, the university, for instance, the new course. The university will lose interest if I don’t put something together, and quickly. Yet every evening I sit in front of my computer and I try to lead my fingers to the keys and instead they flutter above, and I must again admit: this concert, like yesterday’s and that of the day before, will be for Leda. I imagine my audience getting restless. They whisper and start to chuckle nervously. The sound becomes intolerable. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people, uproarious and open mouthed.\n\nThere are many pathological causes of laughter: epilepsy (gelastic seizures), cerebral tumours, Angelman syndrome, strokes, multiple sclerosis, amytrophic lateral sclerosis (motor neurone disease). The name for uncontrollable and persistent laughter is, of course, Homeric. The etymology of Homeric laughter can be traced back to the Iliad– asbestos gelos– the unceasing laughter of the gods, who look down upon us to see our suffering and delight in it. The reason their laughter is without end is because our suffering is without end.\n\nThe above is excerpted from Eli Goldstone’s novelStrange Heart Beating, which is available for purchase now."],[8,"Hackers Hit Dozens of Countries Exploiting Stolen N.S.A. Tool","Security experts described the attacks as the digital equivalent of a perfect storm. They began with a simple phishing email, similar to the one Russian hackers used in the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other targets last year. They then quickly spread through victims’ systems using a hacking method that the N.S.A. is believed to have developed as part of its arsenal of cyberweapons. And finally they encrypted the computer systems of the victims, locking them out of critical data, including patient records in Britain.\n\nThe connection to the N.S.A. was particularly chilling. Starting last summer, a group calling itself the “Shadow Brokers” began to post software tools that came from the United States government’s stockpile of hacking weapons.\n\nThe attacks on Friday appeared to be the first time a cyberweapon developed by the N.S.A., funded by American taxpayers and stolen by an adversary had been unleashed by cybercriminals against patients, hospitals, businesses, governments and ordinary citizens.\n\nSomething similar occurred with remnants of the “Stuxnet” worm that the United States and Israel used against Iran’s nuclear program nearly seven years ago. Elements of those tools frequently appear in other, less ambitious attacks.\n\nThe United States has never confirmed that the tools posted by the Shadow Brokers belonged to the N.S.A. or other intelligence agencies, but former intelligence officials have said that the tools appeared to come from the N.S.A.’s “Tailored Access Operations” unit, which infiltrates foreign computer networks. (The unit has since been renamed.)\n\nThe attacks on Friday are likely to raise significant questions about whether the growing number of countries developing and stockpiling cyberweapons can avoid having those same tools purloined and turned against their own citizens.\n\nThey also showed how easily a cyberweapon can wreak havoc, even without shutting off a country’s power grid or its cellphone network.\n\nIn Britain, hospitals were locked out of their systems and doctors could not call up patient files. Emergency rooms were forced to divert people seeking urgent care.\n\nIn Russia, the country’s powerful Interior Ministry, after denying reports that its computers had been targeted, confirmed in a statement that “around 1,000 computers were infected,” which it described as less than 1 percent of its total. The ministry, which oversees Russia’s police forces, said technicians had contained the attack.\n\nSome intelligence officials were dubious about that announcement because they suspect Russian involvement in the theft of the N.S.A. tools.\n\nBut James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said he suspected that criminals operating from Eastern Europe acting on their own were responsible. “This doesn’t look like state activity, given the targets that were hit,” he said.\n\nThose targets included corporate computer systems in many other countries — including FedEx in the United States, one of the world’s leading international shippers, as well as Spain’s Telefónica and Russia’s MegaFon telecom giant.\n\nIt could take months to find who was behind the attacks — a mystery that may go unsolved. But they alarmed cybersecurity experts everywhere, reflecting the enormous vulnerabilities to internet invasions faced by disjointed networks of computer systems.\n\nThere is no automatic way to “patch” their weaknesses around the world.\n\n“When people ask what keeps you up at night, it’s this,” said Chris Camacho, the chief strategy officer at Flashpoint, a New York security firm tracking the attacks. Mr. Camacho said he was particularly disturbed at how the attacks spread like wildfire through corporate, hospital and government networks.\n\nAnother security expert, Rohyt Belani, the chief executive of PhishMe, an email security company, said the wormlike capability of the malware was a significant shift from previous ransom attacks. “This is almost like the atom bomb of ransomware,” Mr. Belani said, warning that the attack “may be a sign of things to come.”\n\nThe hackers’ weapon of choice on Friday was Wanna Decryptor, a new variant of the WannaCry ransomware, which encrypts victims’ data, locks them out of their systems and demands ransoms.\n\nResearchers said the impact and speed of Friday’s attacks had not been seen in nearly a decade, when the Conficker computer worm infected millions of government, business and personal computers in more than 190 countries, threatening to overpower the computer networks that controlled health care, air traffic and banking systems over the course of several weeks.\n\nOne reason the ransomware on Friday was able to spread so quickly was that the stolen N.S.A. hacking tool, known as “Eternal Blue,” affected a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows servers.\n\nHours after the Shadow Brokers released the tool last month, Microsoft assured users that it had already included a patch for the underlying vulnerability in a software update in March.\n\nBut Microsoft, which regularly credits researchers who discover holes in its products, curiously would not say who had tipped the company off to the issue. Many suspected that the United States government itself had told Microsoft, after the N.S.A. realized that its hacking method exploiting the vulnerability had been stolen.\n\nPrivacy activists said if that were the case, the government would be to blame for the fact that so many companies were left vulnerable to Friday’s attacks. It takes time for companies to roll out systemwide patches, and by notifying Microsoft of the hole only after the N.S.A.’s hacking tool was stolen, activists say the government would have left many hospitals, businesses and governments susceptible.\n\n“It would be deeply troubling if the N.S.A. knew about this vulnerability but failed to disclose it to Microsoft until after it was stolen,” Patrick Toomey, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said on Friday. “These attacks underscore the fact that vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and criminals around the world.”\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the White House created a process to review software vulnerabilities discovered by intelligence agencies, and to determine which should be “stockpiled” for future offensive or defensive cyberoperations and which should be reported to the companies so that they could be fixed.\n\nLast year the administration said that only a small fraction were retained by the government. But this vulnerability appeared to be one of them, and it was patched only recently, suggesting that the N.S.A. may have concluded the tool had been stolen and therefore warned Microsoft.\n\nBut that was clearly too little, and far too late.\n\nOn Friday, hackers took advantage of the fact that vulnerable targets — particularly hospitals — had yet to patch their systems, either because they had ignored advisories from Microsoft or because they were using outdated software that Microsoft no longer supports or updates.\n\nThe malware was circulated by email. Targets were sent an encrypted, compressed file that, once loaded, allowed the ransomware to infiltrate its targets. The fact that the files were encrypted ensured that the ransomware would not be detected by security systems until employees opened them, inadvertently allowing the ransomware to replicate across their employers’ networks.\n\nEmployees at Britain’s National Health Service had been warned about the ransomware threat earlier on Friday. But it was too late. As the disruptions rippled through at least 36 hospitals, doctors’ offices and ambulance companies across Britain, the health service declared the attack a “major incident,” warning that local health services could be overwhelmed.\n\nBritain’s health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was briefed by cybersecurity experts, while Prime Minister Theresa May’s office said on television that “we’re not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised.”\n\nAs the day wore on, dozens of companies across Europe, Asia and the United States discovered that they had been hit with the ransomware when they saw criminals’ messages on their computer screens demanding $300 to unlock their data. But the criminals designed their ransomware to increase the ransom amount on a set schedule and threatened to erase the hostage data after a predetermined cutoff time, raising the urgency of the attack and increasing the likelihood that victims would pay.\n\nWithout the ability to decrypt their data on their own, security experts said that victims who had not backed up their data were faced with a choice: Either live without their data or pay. It was not clear how many victims ultimately paid.\n\nSecurity experts advised companies to immediately update their systems with the Microsoft patch.\n\nUntil organizations use the Microsoft patch, Mr. Camacho said, they could continue to be hit — not just by ransomware, but by all kinds of malicious tools that can manipulate, steal or delete their data.\n\n“There is going to be a lot more of these attacks,” he said. “We’ll see copycats, and not just for ransomware, but other attacks.”"],[8,"Inside London's most expensive gyms","Exercising should, in theory, be free. If you can move your body, you can exercise. Whether that’s running, dancing or squatting, getting fit needn’t cost an impeccably toned arm and a leg.\n\nAnd yet the gym industry in the UK is huge. \n\nLast year’s UK State of the Fitness Industry Report found that the total market value is now estimated to be £4.4 billion and the number of gyms in the UK is increasing.\n\nGym memberships aren’t cheap, but many Brits are signing up and then wasting their money: the average gym-member spent £550 on membership in 2015 but only went 13.5 times in that time - a cost of £40 per visit.\n\nThat may seem pricey, but that’s the average - there are a select number of luxury gyms in the UK (predominantly in London) where the cost of monthly membership could pay for a month’s rent in the capital.\n\nI'm not a natural gym bunny. I’m also a millennial working in the media who has to pay rent in London. And for these reasons, I’m not a gym member. If I was to join one though, I’d probably go to one of the cheap chains which cost about £20 a month.\n\nSometimes, all you want is a few gym machines. Boom, workout, job done. But if you’re wealthy enough - well, why wouldn’t you spend your money on something fancier?\n\nThe question is, just what on earth can you possible do to a gym to justify the exorbitant sums people spend on memberships at the most expensive gyms? I decided to find out.\n\nOne of the most luxurious gyms in London is KX Life, in Chelsea, and boy, is it fancy. \n\nWhilst the main focus is on the gym, KX (pronounced ‘kicks’) is also a spa, restaurant and private members’ club. \n\nIt was founded 25 years ago but is extremely modern inside - in the restaurant and bar area, large lights hang down from a high ceiling over a long marble table, adorned with big vases of flowers.\n\nThere are sofas with the plumpest of perfectly positioned cushions in the bar area as well as the lounge - assistant general manager Lucy Clarke tells me that some of their members use the space to hold sales, be they owners of a jewellery or candle brand.\n\nThe average age of a KX member is 41 - considering their £575 monthly membership fee, it’s not surprising that there aren’t more younger members. However many of the gym’s loyal users have started buying memberships as presents for their children when they turn 18.\n\nThere’s an even split of male and female members, and on the morning I visit I see mainly muscular men, and toned, botoxed women (as well as one minor celebrity).\n\nIt’s also clear that everyone knows everyone at KX - the women chat to each other in the changing room and as Clarke shows me round, she says hi to every person we pass. \n\nDespite the fact that most people exercise because they know they should not because they enjoy it, everyone at KX seems remarkably upbeat given it’s 7.30am on a Wednesday.\n\nBut then again, given how lovely KX is, I don’t blame them - much like a five-star hotel, there's a bowl of apples on the reception counter. And everyone knows that's a sign of a fancy place.\n\nStanding behind the front desk is the concierge, who caters for members’ every desire. \n\nIn the gym, you can forget water fountains - members help themselves to free bottles of mineral water, with a choice of chilled or room temperature. \n\nIn the changing rooms (well, the women’s at least), towels of various sizes, dressing gowns, slippers, combs, makeup remover, moisturiser, deodorant, dry shampoo, hairspray, perfume, razors, hair straighteners, curlers and bobbles are all provided. The majority of the toiletries are Kiehl’s too. (It wasn't going to be Superdrug own-brand, was it?)\n\nThere’s also a housekeeper permanently in each changing room to keep them spotless, as well as a cleaner who comes round and wipes down gym machines after they've been used.\n\nNaturally, all the gym equipment is completely state-of-the-art and most people seem to be having personal training sessions - you can do yours in the main gym or in a private room if you prefer.\n\nAnd after all that hard work, you’re going to want to relax a bit - fortunately, there are steam rooms, saunas and plunge pools at KX too. They’re gender-segregated which is particularly popular with foreign members, Clarke tells me. \n\nIf that wasn’t enough by the way of relaxation, there’s a spa - which is open to non-members - offering treatments including “biostimulatory facial threads” and “pressotherapy lymphatic drainage.” I haven’t a clue either.\n\nOh, and there’s a ‘nail lounge’ dedicated to manicures and pedicures too.\n\nAs elaborate as it all seemed, it was also incredibly beautiful. And the restaurant was no exception.\n\nRather than just grab-and-go snacks and smoothies, the restaurant at KX was developed by their executive chef - with main courses ranging from £16 to £38, you’d hope the food tastes as good as any swanky London standalone restaurant. \n\nYou can also get all your meals from the restaurant delivered, and Clarke tells me some people do. The amount of money you must have to have to be able to afford that is, for most people, mind-boggling. But if you have it, perhaps why wouldn’t you?\n\nKX is, without a doubt, one of the fanciest places I’ve ever been (and I’ve been to some fancy places in my time), but it’s by no means the only one.\n\nOne level down on the luxury scale is Equinox, the US gym chain hoping to conquer the UK. Their first British branch is in Kensington, but they’re planning on expanding in London soon.\n\nAt £205 a month, membership at Equinox is a veritable bargain.\n\nAs seems to be the way with luxury gyms, they like to think of themselves as just as much a members’ club as a fitness club. Once again, they have a lounge and spa, but the feeling is less intimate than at KX, even though members do seem to know each other too.\n\nEquinox is huge and the main gym is open-plan, meaning it’s great for people-watching (and in Kensington, there really are some colourful characters to watch while you're working out). \n\nIt is, undoubtedly, a lovely place to exercise or just chill out, and when I visit I start to realise why people pay so much money for gym memberships - when the place is nice, you actually want to go there.\n\nPerhaps fanciest of all, however, is The Clock in Marylebone. Like all the most luxurious of members’ clubs, there’s no name at the door - from the outside, it looks like any posh London townhouse.\n\nAnd to be fair, it looks a lot like a posh London townhouse inside too.\n\nAfter you cross the marble floor of the entrance hall, you go up a wide, elegant staircase to the first floor. \n\nThe club space is unbelievably plush, complete with chandelier, fireplace, globe and beautiful high ceiling. The Clock founder, Zana Morris, tells me that members hold business meetings here.\n\nWorkout classes are held in the music room, which features a grand piano for extra elegance. It’s not a huge space but there can only be ever be six people in a class at once. \n\nAnd the main gym room at The Clock (which is the sister gym of The Library) is equally intimate - it contains two ginormous pieces of equipment, and I can’t work out whether they look more like instruments of torture or BDSM.\n\nOnly four people will ever be working out at once whilst being instructed by a personal trainer, and every workout is just 12 minutes long. It may sound too good to be true, but it’s hard: the workouts are incredibly intense but are designed to produce rapid and impressive results. \n\nAfter your workout, you can treat yourself to one of the tiny bottles of Seedlip (an expensive non-alcoholic spirit so beloved of the healthy and wealthy) dotted around the building, or perhaps brunch in the gorgeous family-style kitchen.\n\nIt’s almost enough to make a girl consider embarking on a career in the City.\n\nAre these luxurious gyms outrageously expensive? Yes. But would I join one if I was ludicrously - and I mean ludicrously - wealthy? Without a doubt. I’d give loads to charity too of course, but if I still had money leftover, surely it’s better to spend your pennies on staying healthy than buying handbags?\n\nWhilst I'll probably never be able to afford membership at any of these gyms, I've realised that it actually is worth paying a bit more for a nice gym, because if you like it there, you'll actually want to go and working out won't be a chore. \n\nAnd really, who's going to judge if you only use it for the sauna and lounge?"],[8,"Genetics and the Aryan invasion debate","Koenraad Elst (°Leuven 1959) distinguished himself early on as eager to learn and to dissent. After a few hippie years, he studied at the KU Leuven, obtaining MA degrees in Sinology, Indology and Philosophy. After a research stay at Benares Hindu University, he did original fieldwork for a doctorate on Hindu nationalism, which he obtained magna cum laude in 1998. As an independent researcher, he earned laurels and ostracism with his findings on hot items like Islam, multiculturalism and the secular state, the roots of Indo-European, the Ayodhya temple/mosque dispute and Mahatma Gandhi's legacy. He also published on the interface of religion and politics, correlative cosmologies, the dark side of Buddhism, the reinvention of Hinduism, technical points of Indian and Chinese philosophies, various language policy issues, Maoism, the renewed relevance of Confucius in conservatism, the increasing Asian stamp on integrating world civilization, direct democracy, the defence of threatened freedoms, and the Belgian question. Regarding religion, he combines human sympathy with substantive skepticism.\n\nAfter some fifteen years, we may be witnessing a revival in the debate between the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT) and the Out-of-India Theory (OIT). The AIT camp has been completely stonewalling any attempt at debate from the OIT camp for years now, though in the late 1990s some of its tenors did briefly try to refute the pro-OIT arguments then doing the rounds on the brand-new internet forums. But it went into smug hibernation, having decided that on second thought, the whole OIT was too flaky and too politically tainted (even more than the colonialist-cum-Nazi-tainted AIT) to dirty its hands on. Meanwhile, save for a handful of busy bees, the OIT camp was equally smug, deluding itself that it had disproven the AIT long ago. \n\nNow however, one Tony Joseph, veteran business journalist, gate-crashes into the Aryan origins debate via an article in The Hindu: “How genetics is settling the Aryan migration debate” (16 June 2017) This in turn is an interpretation of the impact of a scientific paper by Marina Silva et al.: “A genetic chronology for the Indian Subcontinent points to heavily sex-biased dispersals” (Evolutionary Biology BMC, March, 2017; the team was led by Prof. Martin Richards). Joseph claims that the AIT was put in doubt by earlier genetic studies but that this paper and other recent findings have firmly decided the debate in favour of an invasion. (Well, he uses the weasel word “migration”, like most AIT champions who lack the courage of their conviction; but like most “migrationists”, he turns out to mean not a migration of families in wagons, but an entry of all-male bands of warriors who end up fathering plenty of children upon native women; a scenario ordinarily known as an “invasion”.)\n\n[Tony Joseph]\n\nThe Aryan invasion question is correctly formulated as: “Did IE language speakers, who called themselves Aryans, stream into India some time in 2000-1500 BC?” Joseph’s triumphal answer is: “Genetic research based on an avalanche of new DNA evidence is making scientists around the world converge on an unambiguous answer: yes, they did.”\n\nThe strictly genetical parts of his thesis, I will leave to legitimate geneticists to answer. For starters, two excellent rebuttals have come to my notice: by Anil Kumar Suri and by AL Chavda. In the present article, I have mainly tried to put the highly partisan piece by Joseph in the context of the broader Aryan origins debate and of India’s culture wars.\n\nLinguistic or racial invasion?\n\nAs a reader of internet media, much lambasted by the mainstream media, I am aware of the genetic studies in recent years that were welcomed as disproving the AIT. I was sceptical: the initial generation of genetic studies had to be taken with a big pinch of salt because it suffered of childhood diseases. More fundamentally, genes, much like archaeological findings, don’t speak. You cannot tell from genes, nor from excavated artefacts, what language the people concerned spoke. I frowned when I saw genetic findings being mustered as proof against the linguistic AIT.\n\nConfusing language movements with demographic movements was a childhood disease of Indo-European linguistics before 1945. Especially after Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species (1859), race thinking came to dominate the Humanities. There were warnings from Indo-Europeanists, including the much-maligned Friedrich Max Müller, to maintain the distinction, but the public and many professionals started speaking of “the Aryan race”, not in the vague sense common earlier (race = any group of hereditary belonging, from family to nation and race to humanity, Sanskrit jāti), but in the biological sense. After 1945, this went completely out of fashion in the West, but in India, not encumbered with the guilt about Nazi racism, time has stood still.\n\nThat is why Joseph can assert that a genetic study has disproven a linguistic theory. Strictly speaking, that alone should stamp him incompetent for the Aryan debate. Then again, let us face the fact that among Indians, this confusion is also quite common, as it was among Europeans of an earlier generation. In principle this makes sense: you continue both the genes and the language inherited from your parents. But while your genes can’t be traded in for others, people do change language in the course of their lives, not as a rule but as a sufficiently frequent exception. Before the colonial age, which imparted European languages to a number of colonial populations, white Europe and brown India represented about a half each of the Indo-European-speaking population, thus vividly demonstrating that their language had crossed a racial frontier: either brown to white or white to brown. So, genes and language are different thing, partly related and partly not.\n\nFor an invasion as dramatic and rich in consequences as the Aryan influx is deemed to be, with a complete switch in language and culture of a highly civilized and densely populated country, it is nonetheless unlikely that it would leave no traces at all. In those days, there were no internet courses that allowed you to learn a language spoken at a great distance; for imparting a language to foreigners, it was necessary to go to their country. There must have been some kind of sizeable migration demonstrable in the archaeological and genetic record. In this respect, archaeology is completely disappointing the AIT party, for it consistently refuses to throw up any trace of this fabled Aryan invasion. But they have their hopes up anew: perhaps the genetic record can fill in the blanks?\n\nGiven that pattern of expectation, studies refuting the invasion theory, for whatever they were worth, were very welcome. They dampened the usual arrogance of the AIT camp,-- at least to the extent that people heard of them. The dominant media largely kept the lid on them. If they reported them, it was in measured, or what Joseph calls “nuanced”, tones; nothing like the triumphalism with which he himself claims that genetics has proven the AIT.\n\nNow that at least one scientific paper has been presented as supporting the AIT, the reaction among activist Hindus was initially one of unpleasant surprise, sometimes panic, for many of them had always harboured a secret fear: “What if the scholars do manage to prove the AIT?” But this was followed by a resolve among some of them to revisit the evidence and get serious about the debate again.\n\nOther activist Hindus, by contrast, feel vindicated in their long-standing support for the AIT. Indeed, there exists a casteist-racist fringe among Brahmins who feel flattered by the claim that they descend from foreign conquerors and that they imposed the caste system as a racial Apartheid system. Outsiders including Joseph may not know about this, but any defence of the AIT plays into the hand of the most regressive elements of Hindu society. In the West too, the AIT is not only an unassailable orthodoxy in academe, it also serves as ideological backbone for some remaining racist ideologues.\n\nApart from those fringes, the healthy reaction among more sober Hindu activists is the resolve that they, or at least those among them who are equipped for it, should return to the Aryan debate and win it once and for all. This promises to be an interesting cup final, for the opposing camp is self-assured and in no mind to give in.  \n\nHow does a language invade?\n\nThe origin of the Indo-European languages in India, starring Sanskrit, is principally a linguistic scenario, which must have come about on the waves of historical developments, and these may have left traces in the genetic record. Joseph is neither a linguist nor a historian nor even a geneticist, and in my quarter-century in the thick of the Aryan debate, I have never encountered his name. That need not be an obstacle, for by their own effort, people can become self-taught experts in a specialism in which they have no degree, even after a career in a different field, including business journalism. But they still have to satisfy the same criteria as the certified scholars or scientists whose equal they aspire to be. This, then, is what is missing in this article. Joseph doesn’t have a grasp of some basic issues in this debate.\n\nThis is not so exceptional. Many geneticists themselves don’t properly understand the Aryan debate, already two centuries old before genetics became a useful instrument in reconstructing migrations in history. The first studies in this field, finding e.g. that some genes were strikingly common between North India and Eastern Europe, contained conclusions that were at best not in conflict with the Aryan invasion scenario but did not prove it at all. In casu, they may at that stage have shown up grounds for either an India-to-Europe movement or a Europe-to-India movement without being able to decide between the two. Yet, they concluded in favour of the AIT because they retrofitted their own newfound data into the theory that, they heard, had already been proven by the linguists.\n\nThis is the so-called “circular argument of authority”: first you feed an expert a story, then he himself comes out with that same story, and then you can claim that your own little story has been confirmed by a world expert, thus giving it more authority. For example, when Indian “secularists” invoke the positions of Western India-watchers (about Kashmir, the supposedly secular Constitution, Hindutva etc.), the latter invariably turn out to have first swallowed the biases of their Indian “secularist” sources. So the Indian secularists are really only quoting themselves, though embellished with the academic jargon that Western graduates are so good at.\n\nIn the Aryan debate, the same thing has happened: the AIT viewpoint is first fed to experts from other fields, such as genetics, and then these view the data in their own field through the glasses which their partisan friends have put on their noses. The geneticists quoted here, both in their original papers and in the quotes from interviews, clearly have no independent grasp of the Aryan debate.\n\nThus, the quoted paper by Silva et al. states: “Indo-European has been frequently connected to the so-called ‘Indo-Aryan invasion’ from Central Asia ca. 3,5 ka, and the establishment of the caste system.” There never follows a critical second thought about this received wisdom. Not having studied this debate, they fall back on hearsay from their Orientalist colleagues, who all teach the AIT. What other influence would they have? Those capable of situating and defending the OIT can literally be counted on your fingers; none of them has functioned as an information source for geneticists. Though the geneticists certainly live up to the scientific method when it comes to handling genetic data; when they approach the AIT as possible explanation, they become mere followers of convention. \n\nNevertheless, we should not use this circumstance as an escape clause from the debate. For meanwhile, Joseph does report on a development among geneticists that may well prove as important as he asserts.\n\nInvaders\n\nJoseph claims he is part of a bold dislodging of an established orthodoxy:\n\nOh yes? Where are the schools and institutes that teach the demise of the AIT? The truth is that these studies never made a dent in the pro-AIT orthodoxy. The mainstream media chose to talk about them only minimally, the textbooks never mention them at all. The only people excited about these findings were the OIT adherents, and if you listened in on them, you might get the impression that the time was ripe for the acceptance of the OIT.\n\nWhat has suddenly happened, according to Joseph, is this: “Until recently, only data on mtDNA (or matrilineal DNA, transmitted only from mother to daughter) were available and that seemed to suggest there was little external infusion into the Indian gene pool over the last 12,500 years or so. New Y-DNA data has turned that conclusion upside down, with strong evidence of external infusion of genes into the Indian male lineage during the period in question.”\n\nIn itself, it is no big deal that Joseph misinterprets the “mt” as “matrilineal” instead of “mitochondrial”, but again it suggests he is unfamiliar with his chosen topic. In journalism you often have to deal with unfamiliar subjects, but relative to the tall claims he makes in this article, he ought to have done his homework better. Nonetheless, he whets our curiosity for his evidence on the Y-chromosome data.\n\nNote the AIT-serving claim, appearing out of the blue, that the Pontic-Caspian steppe “is seen as” the region of origin. This expression is a sure give-away of hearsay, of a borrowed opinion. It is not based on the geneticists’ R1a research.\n\nFrankly, I had understood that the jury is still out concerning the origin of R1A, and that it is strikingly in evidence among some “aboriginal” Indian tribes. But not being a geneticist, I will not argue too forcefully about that. At any rate, the paper by Silva et al. does not say that it found earlier studies to have been mistaken about this, and is altogether more nuanced and temperate than the tall and abrasive claims by Joseph.\n\nIn that paper,\n\nThat is something else altogether. Their evidence concerning an origin in “the Pontic-Caspian region” will have to be studied, of course. But note that the scientists admit that they have not studied the link between their genetic data and the identification of the purported migrants as Indo-European: this is only “attributed” and “inferred”, meaning “borrowed on trust from our Indo-Europeanist informers”, all of them wedded to the AIT. They do not make a professional claim for the AIT, that is only a speculative afterthought, merely for genetically attested movements.\n\n“In an email exchange”, of which doesn’t tell us the leading questions,\n\nTheir identification as Indo-European is, in his mouth, not more than hearsay, by definition not corroborated by genetic data, nor by the archaeological data, which show up no such dramatic discontinuity, as even AIT partisans admit. “Bronze Age” is also but a vague name for a long and ill-defined period. But we retain that, if rendered correctly, he does insist on a real influx from Central Asia still showing up in 17,5% of the Indian Y-chromosomes.\n\nCentral-Asian invaders in Hindu historiography\n\nIf this claim proves correct, there are a number of other explanations. An influx from Central Asia is roundly admitted by Indian tradition. Shakas, Kushanas and Hunas came in the historical period, just before and just after the time of Christ. Long before that, since the onset of the Ice Age, many northerners escaped the barren north and migrated south, hence e.g. the many blondes described by the Egyptians among their western neighbours; India too must have been among their destinations. And between those chronological extremes, there must have been more. \n\nThough their incursion was considered dramatic at the time, with Vikramaditya of Ujjain hailed by Indians as the defeater of the Shaka invaders, it remained inconsequential culturally, as these invaders dissolved in the Indian population and assimilated the language and religion of their hosts. Only their genes remained, till recently in hiding, but now accessible. Today they must form part of those 17.5%.\n\n[A statue of King Vikramaditya at Ujjain]\n\nA second consideration is that an inflow does not prevent a movement in the other direction. If the Silva paper is sensational, it might be because of passages like this one, about the Bronze Age: “Gene flow at this time was clearly bi-directional, as seen in the expansion west of lineages M5a2a4, U2c1b + 146 and M3a1b + 13105. This is reflected in the genome-wide ADMIXTURE analysis (…), where the autochthonous South Asian component (…) appears at low levels in Iran.”\n\nFor readers of The Hindu (please note, foreigners, that this name is a historical relic, and that since decades it is a left-wing anti-Hindu paper), it may come as a surprise that a paper claimed to prove the AIT actually documents a bit of OIT. Others will be less surprised by this confirmation of the emigrations from India, in line with extant archaeological findings and with the general drift of earlier genetic studies, -- which Joseph’s article was meant to counter.\n\nAnother possibility, tailor-made for the Hindu reader, is a compromise. Come to think of it, it is surprising that none of those synthesis-enamoured Gandhians raised this possibility before: a scenario that approximately satisfies both the AIT and the OIT camps. Here, there was an influx from Central Asia, which with the help of linguistics we could pinpoint to ca. 4000 BC, the farthest estimate of the fragmentation of Proto-Indo-European. Only, this influx did not bring Indo-Aryan, the exclusively Indian branch of Indo-European (distinct from other branches such as Greek, Celtic, Slavic etc., that “remained” in the west), as the AIT holds, but all of the branches, still united in their foremother, Proto-Indo-European.\n\nAs Shrikant Talageri has shown, Hindu tradition envisages all of “Aryan” history as the life and times of the descendents of Manu, the founder-king who landed with his Flood-survival ship in Manali and set up his court in Ayodhya. A descendent of his was Yayati, whose sons Druhyu and Anu must have been the ancestors of the non-Indian branches of Indo-European, destined to leave India in the pre-Vedic period c.q. in the middle Vedic period. Greek ambassadors after Alexander reported a Hindu tradition that Manu had come into India from the west. Like their estimate that Manu was crowned in precisely -6776, this may be a garbled reconstruction of hazy traditions; but for what it is worth, it might correspond to the alleged genetic findings of an early influx. After all, though India may be the cradle of all branches of Indo-European (exactly the OIT), nothing has been claimed about where the Proto-Indo-Europeans originate. It could be outside India, all while leaving the OIT untouched.\n\n[Shrikant Talageri]\n\nAs even Silva et al. acknowledge, “genetic data have provided no clear evidence for the ‘Indo-Aryan invasions’ so far, and their very existence is challenged by many archaeologists.” Tony Joseph has a long way to go before the AIT can be accepted as proven.\n\nGlobalization\n\nIn spite of the foregoing, let us appreciate what got Joseph so enthused about recent developments in genetics:\n\nThat is not true for the identification as Indo-European, which would at best be plausible, but otherwise I acknowledge Richards must be a pioneering scientist in a fast-progressing research field. The argument of authority implied in “around the world” is also exaggerated, for the really pioneering genetic research is confined to a few countries. China has recently joined the front group, and India is catching up, but if you see exotic names among the authors, they are mostly at American or European universities; witness all the Portuguese names under the quoted research paper produced in the UK. But this much is true: whereas the Indo-European origins question holds a certain fascination for people of European descent, the new research yields very similar new insights in the demographic history of other cultures.   \n\nJoseph quotes David Reich, geneticist and professor, Harvard Medical School:\n\nAbout that, we can only rejoice and join Joseph in his enthusiasm. And we may at once point out that a vaguely similar though more gradual development is taking place in the highly relevant field of linguistics, with the increasing sérieux of the once-flaky sub discipline of megacomparatism. So far, Indo-European studies including the Aryan origins debate focused on what happened after Proto-Indo-European, once the fragmentation had set in. But now we can look beyond that, and explain the long-existing suspicions of a kinship with Semitic, or the newly-realized kinship with Dravidian. This too is a heady evolution, though encumbered by the 19-century impression of bookishness when genetics has all the glitter of futuristic science.\n\nMore controversial is another big name he invokes: “Peter Underhill, scientist at the Department of Genetics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, is one of those at the centre of the action. Three years ago, a team of 32 scientists he led published a massive study mapping the distribution and linkages of R1a. It used a panel of 16,244 male subjects from 126 populations across Eurasia. Dr. Underhill’s research found that R1a had two sub-haplogroups, one found primarily in Europe and the other confined to Central and South Asia. Ninety-six per cent of the R1a samples in Europe belonged to sub-haplogroup Z282, while 98.4% of the Central and South Asian R1a lineages belonged to sub-haplogroup Z93. The two groups diverged from each other only about 5,800 years ago.”\n\nNote that 5,800 years ago is about the time estimated by legitimate experts in linguistics for the initial fragmentation of Proto-Indo-European. It could for instance be the time when an Indo-European-speaking population left its Indian homeland.\n\nFrom these data about Z93, it does not follow that “Indo-European language speakers came” to India. Here you see a vivid illustration of how the interpretative framework in terms of an Aryan invasion is merely borrowed on trust from people whose bias the geneticists don’t even realize.\n\nNonetheless, Joseph takes this as a sufficiently strong launching-pad for an unwarranted jump:\n\nThis is not the expert speaking. Note indeed that in spite of Joseph wanting Dr. Underhill to say that, and no doubt trying to make him say it, the professor is not quoted as saying it. All that the quoted text says, is that these genes have a common origin, and that they split up when spread over sizable distances. The OIT has no quarrel with that. Then, he adds the AIT as possibly explaining his findings, but that part is not his expertise as a geneticist speaking. His findings are just as compatible with the OIT, but that is just not part of his mental horizon.\n\nAccording to Joseph:\n\nBut even with the data now claimed, R1a is still more diverse in India than in Central Asia and Europe. If the former is therefore incapable of being the homeland, so are the latter. Nonetheless, our AIT activist goes full steam ahead:\n\nHere we see no link with an immigration, perfectly unnecessary for a genetic differentiation. And if there was one, it apparently took place 4,500 years ago, still a thousand years before the established Aryan invasion scenario.\n\nBut at least we note with satisfaction that Joseph has belatedly accepted that nothing points to the once-orthodox scenario of the Aryan plunderers ruining the Harappan civilization: “This is remarkable, because roughly 4,000 years ago is when the Indus Valley civilization began falling apart. (There is no evidence so far, archaeologically or otherwise, to suggest that one caused the other; it is quite possible that the two events happened to coincide.)”\n\nThen, Joseph makes another jump: “The avalanche of new data has been so overwhelming that many scientists who were either sceptical or neutral about significant Bronze Age migrations into India have changed their opinions. Dr. Underhill himself is one of them.”\n\nIf true, such conversion among experts would count as prized secondary evidence. Thus, leading archaeology professor BB Lal’s and Sanskrit professor Nicholas Kazanas’ conversion from AIT to OIT have been functioning as serious arguments of authority, especially in the absence of such conversions in the opposite direction. But let us look more closely:\n\nImpressive progress, yet that does not make Underhill find genes moving into India. Though certainly trying hard, Joseph has not managed to extract a statement from Underhill that his earlier research was wrong.\n\nJoseph is very good at making the most of what comes under his hand, and of shading over nuanced expert findings into his own blatantly partisan narrative. However, our interest is not in finding fault with Joseph; indeed we thank him for drawing our attention to this new scientific development. Our interest is in what genetics really has to say on the Aryan origins question.\n\nNorth-South divide\n\nJoseph claims another convert from OIT to AIT:\n\nWesterners will only be mildly excited by this, but in India, the racial interpretation of the linguistic division between Indo-Aryans and Dravidians is so vividly kept alive by Dravidianists, Ambedkarites and their missionary shepherds, that others there will heave a sigh of relief at news of the “admixture” between the two populations.\n\nIn the same vein, Indian patriots rejoiced that the study found “the ANI ancestry higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers”.\n\nWell of course: speakers of Indo-Aryans live predominantly in the north, so they have a higher incidence of northern genes. As for the higher castes, it doesn’t take any invasion scenario to understand that they must be more from the north, as per the written Hindu tradition. Especially in Tamil Nadu, hotbed of Dravidianism, this is striking, with Bania castes originating in Rajasthan and Gujarat, and Brahmins imported from the north by kings who wanted to endow their dynasties with Vedic prestige. So obviously, in Dravidian areas, upper castes will stand out by their more northern genes. But only gradually, for even here there is an “admixture”.\n\nHence this comment quoted from a prominent Indian researcher involved in this study, geneticist Lalji Singh: “But at some point in time, the ancient north and the ancient south mixed, giving birth to a different set of population. (…) This paper rewrites history (…) there is no north-south divide”! A newspaper headline made it even more sensational: “Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study”.\n\n(The linguistic state of the art on this is that Dravidian is related to Elamite in Southwestern Iran, a reasonable theory insufficiently verified but largely based on trust in the very few scholars who have investigated these data. An anti-India bias predictably deduces from this that Dravidian must have come from Elam, not the other way around. And then, after having entered India and developed in Gujarat, Dravidian expanded to the south, where a more primitive native population adopted the language. To the dismay of Dravidian chauvinists and separatists, this means that Dravidian is not native to South India, but that it is native to India. The political unit they ought to be defending is not “Dravidasthan”, but India. Moreover, Dravidian is related to Indo-European on a par with Uralic, Semitic et al., descending from a common grandmother-language some 15,000 years ago, “Nostratic”, as distinct from more distant languages like Munda, Tibetan, Andamanese etc.)\n\nANI and populations to the west\n\nJoseph’s misunderstanding of the whole Aryan issue is again clear from this claim: “By itself, the study didn’t disprove the arrival of Indo-European language speakers; if anything, it suggested the opposite, by pointing to the genetic linkage of ANI to Central Asians.”\n\nThat North-Indians and Central-Asians are related, as the genetic linkage between them implies, is true in any serious scenario, certainly also in the OIT. Being closer to Central Asia, it is perfectly normal for the ANI to have more in common with it than the ASI. The only narrative that throws up a problem here is not the OIT, with speakers of Indo-Europeans streaming out of India into Central Asia and thence into Europe, but a purely reactive alternative to the AIT, viz. the non-migration scenario. When Europeans first thought up the AIT around 1820 (after having espoused the OIT for half a century) and then took it to India, many Indians simply denied that anyone had come from anywhere, and pointed out correctly that nothing amounting to what is known as the Aryan invasion (with the importation of Sanskrit from outside) is described in scripture.\n\nNo, but the Rg-Veda and the Puranas do describe a hoary emigration from India, viz. of the Druhyu and Anu tribes. Therefore, knowledgeable Indians have adopted the OIT, which necessitates commonalities between India, Central Asia and Europe as much as the AIT does.\n\nBut I have no doubt that Joseph’s dialogue partners in Aryan origins discussions included many who saw no need to explain the linguistic commonalities between Indo-Aryan and the languages further west, and simply settled for the static and unimaginative non-migration narrative. Those people reject the very concept of an Indo-European language: to them, Greek, Germanic and other European languages are not related to Sanskrit, and so there is no need for any migration either way to explain how they came to be in their present habitat. If at all you confront them with similarities, they make bold that these are just loanwords.  \n\nThis is part of a larger problem, that explains why the OIT has made no headway at all in terms of international acceptance. Most Indians don’t have their heart in the OIT, a non-Indian term launched by the American Hare Krishna follower Dr. Edwin Bryant ca. 1996. In describing the Aryan debate, he took ample account of a vocal Indian vanguard that understands the basics of the Indo-European question, viz. that one language straddles the Hindu Kush, and that therefore half its speakers must have crossed this border either in eastern or in western direction (AIT c.q. OIT). But far more weighty and numerous in India are those who merely want to be left alone, who don’t want to be bothered with the AIT and all its concomitant politics (colonialist, Nazi, Dravidianist, Dalit). They simply have no specific theory about the non-Indian Indo-Europeans: these are simply not within their mental horizon, which stops at the Khyber Pass. The question whether they migrated, and whether they really speak a cognate language, is simply of no interest to these AIT-rejecting laymen.\n\nWestern participants in the debate may have debated some OIT sophisticates from a distance, but they have also interacted with Indian-born colleagues from, say, the Medical or Engineering Department of their university, who are bright but have never studied the Aryan question. These far more representative Indians often have strong opinions about the “breaking India” implications of an Aryan invasion but not the necessary knowledge to argue this point, often even rejecting the whole notion of an Indo-European family. They are “under-informed but over-opinionated”. Meeting such people makes Western Indo-Europeanists sceptical of any Indian contribution to this debate, and by extension of any pro-OIT contribution even by Western colleagues. Both Sanskrit professor Nicholas Kazanas (Athens) and myself have many anecdotes up our sleeves of how any Homeland debate in which the OIT figures, is being stonewalled by AIT-leaning linguists.\n\nGenetics and linguistics\n\nNow, Tony Joseph is going to teach us reason:\n\nFor that, no “stretch beyond reason” is necessary, for the two phenomena, the genetic division in ANI and ASI and the linguistic division in Indo-European, Dravidian and others, are unrelated. Even if the ANI people came from outside, any “reasonable” scenario has them mingle with natives and take in lots of their genetic heritage, rather than commit genocide on them and replace them wholesale with a different genetic type. Then again, this genocide does exist, viz. as part of the Dravidianist mythology, especially in its missionary version, because of overcompensation for the real genocide of natives in the Americas that accompanied their Christianization.\n\nIf I have understood anything of these genetic discussions, it is that chronological estimations of genetic events are possible (much as in historical linguistics, though this “glottochronology” is in fact highly controversial). Apparently, the split of the Indian people in a northern ANI and a southern ASI dates a lot deeper into the past than the fragmentation of Indo-European and than the “Bronze Age migration” discussed in Silva et al.’s paper, and need not even result from a migration, as Joseph had assumed. And if there was a migration at all, it may not have been the Aryan invasion, or may have nothing to do (causally nor chronologically) with the division of Indo-European.\n\nThe concepts of ANI and ASI were developed by geneticists untrained in linguistics and never visibly bothering about a coordination between their own data and those of historical linguistics. So, it is not so scandalous if the two sets of data are greatly at variance.\n\nConspiracy by association\n\nIn some reactions, Tony Joseph has been attacked on account of the company he keeps. Look whom he quotes:\n\nContents-wise, we have a repeat of Joseph’s just-discussed mistakes: (1) he identifies the genesis of ANI with an immigration, as if such genetic development could not originate in a vast area like the subcontinent; and (2) he identifies this unsubstantiated migration with the supposed Indo-European migration. But the interesting thing here is not what Khan says, but who he is.\n\nIt is rumoured, in some reactions below Joseph’s article as well as elsewhere, that Khan is a right-winger, has published on the “race-realist” website Vdare (after Virginia Dare, the first white person born on American soil), and has been sacked as a columnist by the New York Times. This is “guilt by association”: Joseph’s position is blackened by association with the company he keeps, and Khan’s position on Indian genetics is blackened by association with his writing outlets. This type of gossip is very popular among illiterates, who lack the habit of serious debate on issues, and of seasoned debaters who realize that in a given case, no argument ad rem will succeed, and who therefore resort to an argument ad hominem.\n\nA quotation that deserves repetition in almost every debate on the Aryan question, and many other debates besides, is: “Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people.” It is often flatteringly ascribed to Eleanore Roosevelt but is traceable farther back, at least to Theology professor Samuel Miller in 1827. It contains a part of the reason why AIT skepticism has made no headway.\n\nA few of us have tried to present the arguments for the OIT, but our discourse was drowned out by the shouting and cackling of numerous vocal Hindus against famous upholders of the AIT: “The British concocted the AIT as part of their divide-and-rule policy!”, “William Jones was a colonial agent!”, “Friedrich Max Müller was a missionary agent!”, “Michael Witzel is a professor of Harvard, started as a theology school!” This has greatly put off serious scholars who didn’t know better than the AIT and would have given a fair hearing to the OIT if it had not been associated with this miserable conspiracy discourse (as well as with Hindu Nationalism).\n\nNot that their camp is much better. There too we have “guilt by association” thinking. AIT pamphlets often contain phrases like: “The OIT is defended by people like PN Oak, NS Rajaram, Koenraad Elst…” (This, incidentally, is untrue: the late PN Oak deduced everything everywhere from India or Hinduism, with no special role for Indo-European, and NS Rajaram rejected the AIT but equally pooh-poohed the OIT and any other concern about any non-Indians, including the claim that they came from India.) This is mere juxtaposition, but in the real world it functions as association and achieves the target of putting all the people mentioned outside of polite society.  \n\nAll these associates on the anti-AIT side can shout all they want, because they only speak to their own side, never interact with the AIT camp and never suffer any (healthily correcting) consequences. The consequences are for us, who live in the real world and interact with real opponents. Just recently, I had been arranged to speak at an archaeology conference in Maastricht (Netherlands), in a panel on interdisciplinary research, where I had proposed to discuss the unique situation where a theory is treated by some as unshakably certain, viz. the AIT by European linguists, and by others of equally high academic rank as completely outdated and unsupported, viz. by Indian archaeologists. At the last moment, my participation was annulled. Clearly, the same thing happened that has happened many times before: my abstract was judged interesting enough, but then someone up there was briefed about my views and associations, and intervened to my detriment.\n\nAnother aspect of the backbiting against Razib Khan concerns its relevance. Those who cite the incriminating opinions about him, should tell us what difference such contemporary facts make to the truth or otherwise of the AIT, which pertains to events that took place thousands of years ago. It is irrelevant chronologically. At least if your goal is not to win an ongoing debate with Joseph by making him look bad, but to disprove the AIT. I guess small minds don’t aim that high.\n\nIt is also irrelevant logically. The truth of a proposition is independent of its formulator’s record or character. Surely you can find writing-pads from Adolf Hitler’s childhood in which the devil himself writes: “1 + 1 = 2”. Does this suddenly become untrue just because an unsavoury character agreed with it?\n\nAs an extra, I would like to learn whether the purported boycott of this alleged brown racist is a policy that our AIT  disbelievers advocate. Attempts to shut down debate and impose left-wing control are as much a problem in Berkeley as in Jawaharlal Nehru University. The people who call this Khan a “right-winger” are the same who attack Hindus with the same allegation. Hinduism is deemed a racist religion, with Brahmin Aryan invaders oppressing the native Dalits and Dravidians. American liberals, in this case strange bedfellows with the Evangelists, consider the struggle against caste and untouchability and against its justifying ideology, Hinduism, as a noble and necessary struggle, a new frontline now that slavery has been abolished elsewhere.\n\nSo, this Razib Khan may have unsavoury opinions or associations, and he may be downright wrong about the AIT, but he is entitled to having his comments on a genetics debate discussed in an Indian left-wing paper. To that extent, he deserves our support.\n\nSymmetrical migration\n\nLet us return to genetics and quote Joseph again: “Let’s (…) ask what Reich says now, when so much new data have become available? In an interview with Edge in February last year, while talking about the thesis that Indo-European languages originated in the Steppes and then spread to both Europe and South Asia, he said: “The genetics is tending to support the Steppe hypothesis because in the last year, we have identified a very strong pattern that this ancient North Eurasian ancestry that you see in Europe today, we now know when it arrived in Europe. It arrived 4500 years ago from the East from the Steppe...”\n\nYes, there was an Aryan invasion, but it was not the one usually meant. In Central Europe in the -3 millennium, the material culture changed drastically. In some areas, the population was entirely replaced by newcomers, in others too the percentage of newcomers was sizeable. By culture and physical type (now mapped and understood more precisely thanks to genetics), they were the same people later identified as Celts, Germans, Romans. There, in Europe, we really have an invasion of Aryans moving in from the east. And now that we know what a real Aryan invasion looks like, we note that it is completely missing in India.\n\nSpeaking of which:\n\nNote that Reich doesn’t describe an invasion, at least not in the passage Joseph chooses to quote here. He describes an admixture of different populations, something that can easily be imagined as internal to a large territory such as India, not needing foreign immigrations. Instead, it could have to do with the migrations triggered by the dessiccation of the Saraswati basin, for instance. It is only Joseph himself who interprets Reich’s statement as “in essence” a matter of Aryan invasions.\n\nAlso note that Joseph has “the Indo-European language speakers” spread from the steppes to “both Europe and South Asia”. While this is not impossible, it rarely happens. Migrations are mostly very asymmetrical because the reasons why humans migrate are rarely symmetrical.\n\nThus, the Bantu languages were carried forward by the Neolithic innovation, agriculture, and ended up being dominant in half of Africa, all starting from somewhere in sub-Saharan West-Africa. Why did they only expand in a southeastern direction, and not north? Because you cannot practise agriculture in the desert.\n\nSimilarly, Austronesian has spread south from Southeast China, not north, because to their north was a numerous and well-ordered society that would assimilate any immigrants; southwards, they could find a niche in Malaysia and Indonesia, and virgin territory in islands from Madagascar to New Zealand and Hawaii. For the same reason, Russian could expand eastwards all the way to Alaska, but not westwards. In the case of Arabic, no such reason can immediately be identified (Iran could just as well have been arabicized as Egypt), yet fact remains: Arabic spread from Arabia westwards all the way to Morocco, and not eastwards at all.\n\nAlso, the steppe does not support large populations, whereas India was a demographic heavyweight, then already. It is not impossible for (all-male) bands of steppe warriors to conquer centres of civilization, but leaving a lasting imprint is rarer. The Huns invaded China, India and Europe and did not leave their language anywhere; in fact, we are not even sure what it was (Attila was a Gothic nickname; after much research, the dominant estimate now is that they spoke Chuvash, a para-Turkic language marginally surviving in Russia). The Mongols invaded Central and Western Asia, Eastern Europe, and China, yet except for marginal Kalmukkia, they did not leave their language anywhere. And such invaders should have completely changed the linguistic and cultural landscape of mighty India?\n\nParting shot\n\nThe final paragraph is merely an exercise in slamming open doors. Or so it seems, for several in-your-face assertions are built into this innocuous piece of journalistic emptiness:\n\nThis is a phrase absolutely no one will disagree with; though it conceals the more pressing question how weighty the different contributions are, and the false implication that these are all equal. Yet, it is here for a reason, part of The Hindu’s editorial line: it is meant as a punch in the face of the Hindu Nationalists, who stress unity. Not racial unity, as is here falsely intimated, but still some kind of pan-Indian sense of national unity, translating today in e.g. the conviction that Kashmir belongs with India. Therefore, among secularists, it is always welcomed if an anti-unity statement of any kind is smuggled in.\n\nThat “bedrock of the population” phrase may not be so innocent, as it is probably meant to exclude the Brahmins and thus forms part of the dominant anti-Brahmin discourse. But it is not said in so many words, so let that pass. Anyway, Joseph already refrains from saying that Indian indigenousness is confined to the tribals (some 8%), whom the missionaries ca. 1930 have started flattering as Adivasis, a pseudo-traditional Sanskrit coinage meaning “aboriginals”, like the Amerindians in America.\n\nNevertheless, against the “Aryan invaders”, he still tries to affirm their superiority by calling their entry from Africa more than 50,000 years ago “fearless”. Exchanging lion territory for tiger territory must indeed be courageous and certainly “pioneering”, but peopling an empty land is not braver than invading a human habitat. The Aryan invaders may never have existed, but if you do postulate them, as Joseph does, you have to at least credit them with the bravery required for defeating a vastly more numerous native population. If you care to look at the details, his bias is showing.\n\nHere we get the bulwark part of the secularist view of ancient India: the Harappan population spoke a different language than the Northwest-Indian population today, mostly taken to be Dravidian; and their civilizational innovations starting with agriculture had been borrowed from abroad, viz. from West Asia. This latter point is important to stress, as Hindu Nationalists might get the pretentious idea that some inventions had been done in India and even by Indians; Allah forbid!\n\nBut at least Joseph recognizes that the Harappans, deemed non-Aryans, “arrived” from somewhere else. We are talking of what was then the largest demographic concentration on earth, so it is hard to imagine how they all came from the surrounding mountains and deserts. Nevertheless, the core of truth here is that Dravidian, deemed to have been the language of Harappa, arrived from somewhere. The aboriginality of Dravidian, which Dravidian chauvinists take for granted as a logical counterpoint to Aryan foreignness, deserves questioning.\n\nThe Mundas, tribals whose language must have been spoken all around the Bay of Bengal, speak an Austro-Asiatic language related to Vietnamese. However, the jury is still out on whether their homeland (as well as the homeland of rice cultivation) was in India or in Southeast Asia.\n\nThis phrase, affirming the foreign origin of Sanskrit through the Aryan Invasion Theory, is the raison d’être for this whole paragraph. Tony Joseph may not be a geneticist, nor a historian or linguist, but having been editor of the Business World, he is a first-class journalist. The occupational hazard of this vocation is that you have to talk about any topic that may come under your hands, often very much outside your area of expertise; such is the case in this article about the genetic evidence for an Aryan invasion. But a strength of this professional group is their mastery of simple rhetorical devices. Case in point: writing a conciliatory final paragraph full of empty phrases amounting to an all-together-now chumminess, and yet, inside it, burying a dagger aimed at your usual target: “Aryans”, Brahmins, Hindus.\n\nAlthough not the topic of the article, this phrase is nevertheless highly welcome to drive home the usual concern of any secularist paper: affirming that Muslims and Christians are equally entitled to whatever India has to offer. Note however that in crucial respects, unlike earlier immigrants such as Shakas and Hunas, who have dissolved their identities in the ambient population and culture, Muslims and Christians have not “mingled”.\n\n“We are all migrants.”\n\nWhat an enlightened phrase, meant to reassure his secularist friends of his own virtue and to exercise moral pressure on status-conscious Hindus that they should shed this backward attachment to the nationalism-infested Indian homeland theory. Yet, do you think that all the anti-Hindu and anti-Brahmin activists who now go around triumphantly quoting Joseph’s article, intend to say: “We too, we are but migrants, as much as the invading Aryans”?\n\nConclusion\n\nBy now, Tony Joseph may wish he had never written this piece. He presents a blatantly partisan interpretation of a recent research paper in a field he visibly doesn’t master. At least he could have had it proofread by a legitimate geneticist. His bias pertains to the Aryan origins question, and that too he hasn’t thought through.\n\nThen again, I understand that he felt the normal journalistic urge to let the world know about a new development that he considered very important. For a definitive account, you do not go to journalists, their role is not that of experts, merely of messengers: “Something is happening over there; now go see for yourself what is really is.” At the present state of the art in genetics, however, developments are not as dramatic as he seems to have thought.\n\nNonetheless, we had better look into them. The geneticists he has quoted here may not be the publicity-seeking types who like to make bold statements. Nonetheless, their belief in an all-male incursion into India that has left traces in the Y-genes may well have substantial ramifications for Indian history, even by implying an Aryan invasion. And while none of them has been quoted as actually having proven, through his research, an Indo-European invasion, it is still possible that some of them do think so. Or, because of the present commotion over Joseph’s article, they may step back to make up their minds, now with a better grasp of the Aryan origins question, and finally conclude that what they have proven, does imply the Aryan invasion. It will take argumentative acumen and a serious research effort to convince them otherwise.\n\nHindus have long acted as if it is enough to convince yourself in order to be entitled to declaring yourself as winner of the debate. In fact, it is necessary to convince others before you can rest on your laurels. Therefore, we must thank Joseph for spurring us into more and better research. After two centuries, let’s get this invasion nuisance over and done with."],[8,"Met's Collin Sutton refused to lead Madeleine McCann probe","A detective tipped to head up the Madeleine McCann probe was warned he would be ordered to prove she was abducted and ignore other leads. \n\nColin Sutton said a high-ranking friend in the Met called him and warned him not to lead the case when Scotland Yard announced it would get involved in 2010.\n\nThe source warned that he would be tasked with proving her parents Kate and Gerry were innocent and ignoring any alternatives to the abduction theory, he claims.\n\nSpeaking to Martin Brunt on Sky News, he said: 'I did receive a call from a very senior met police officer who knew me and said it wouldn’t be a good idea for me to head investigation on the basis that I wouldn’t be happy conducting an investigation being told where I could go and where I couldn’t go, the things I could investigate and the things I couldn’t.\n\nAsked to clarify what he meant, he added: 'The Scotland Yard investigation was going to be very narrowly focused and that focus would be away from any suspicion of wrongdoing on the part of the McCanns or the tapas friends.'\n\nThe Tapas Nine refers to the McCann parents and the seven friends they were out to dinner with when Madeleine disappeared in 2007.\n\nThey were interviewed by Portuguese Police, who have always worked on the basis that Madeleine was abducted from her room, but Mr Sutton said other possibilities should be entertained.\n\nSpeaking on Searching for Maddie, which looks at the case ten years on from her disappearance, he criticises the narrow focus of both Portuguese and British police.\n\nHe added: 'If you are conducting a re-investigation you start at the very beginning. Look at all the accounts all the evidence all the initial statements and go through them and make sure they stack up and they compare.'\n\nThe documentary revealed details from a Home Office report on the case, ordered by then Labour minister Alan Johnson before the 2010 election, seen by Sky News' Martin Brunt.\n\nThe report shows that Gerry and Kate McCann's relationship with Portuguese police after they closed the investigation into her disappearance.\n\nThe Met took the unusual step of getting involved in the case in 2010 after the report was compiled, and recommends police collaborate with private investigators hired by the McCanns because of the 'unique nature of the case'.\n\nHowever, it also reveals that much of the information gathered by investigators had not been shared with police investigating the case so far.\n\nHighlighting the 'turbulent relationship' between the parents and detectives, it describes how the McCann's felt badly treated by the Portuguese authorities.\n\nThey were called in to speak to officers then asked to wait for hours, only for a detective never to appear, in treatment they described as 'inhumane'.\n\nThe relationship broke down entirely when Portuguese police closed the investgation in to Madeleine's disappearance in in Praia de Luz.\n\nWhen the Met Police came in, they also fell out with local police. The Met would later fall out with the McCanns too, the report revealed.  \n\nMr Johnson wanted to find out if the Met should intervene further in the case so the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre investigated. \n\nIt was commissioned in late 2009, completed by March 2010 and published in May 2010, MailOnline understands.\n\nIn May 2011 the Home Office launched the Scotland Yard review of the case. The Met's investigation has cost £11million so far.\n\nThe report said: 'It is clear that from the beginning the McCanns felt there was a lack of clarity and communication on the part of the Portuguese police.\n\n'Despite the involvement of British consular staff, they were, by their own accounts, left for long periods without any updates or communication with the investigators.\n\n'They state they were taken to the police station on more than one occasion and then left for hours waiting to speak to someone who never materialised.\n\n'They describe this situation as inhumane, with no real consideration for their emotional and physical wellbeing.'\n\nThe report also reveals tensions between the Portuguese and British police, with the Met accused of acting 'like a colonial power'.\n\nThe report says: 'Clearly, the McCanns have had a turbulent relationship with both Portuguese and UK law enforcement. They now openly acknowledge that there is a distinct lack of trust between all parties.'\n\nThe police in Britain and Portugal say they are working together to find Madeleine, who vanished on May 3 2007.\n\nThe documentary was aired just hours after it emerged the former Portuguese detective Goncalo Amaral claimed Madeleine's body was cremated in a TV interview.\n\nThe detective, one of the leading investigators early in the case, made the wild statement hours after her parents vowed to take him back to court over other claims.\n\nAmaral made his latest statement on a TV documentary to be aired on the 10th anniversary of her disappearance from the Praia da Luz resort in Portugal.\n\nThe claims will add to the anguish of her parents who, in a moving interview this week, said they have still not given up hope on seeing Madeleine again.\n\nAmaral said she may have been hidden in another British woman's coffin as she was cremated, and said the church where Madeleine's parents prayed was key.\n\nHe said: 'We had information three figures went into the church via a side door at night. They had a box and there was to be a cremation of a British woman.\n\n'It is possible the child's remains were in this box and cremated as well. The parents had the key to the church,' reports The Sun.\n\nThe claim is the latest spark in a long dispute between Amaral, who was booted off the Madeleine case, and Kate and Gerry McCann. \n\nAmaral, 57, claimed in The Truth Of The Lie that Madeleine died at the McCann's holiday house and Kate and Gerry covered it up.\n\nThe McCanns won a libel case against Amaral in 2015, and he was ordered to pay them 250,000 euros (£209,000) each in damages.\n\nBut this was overturned on appeal and that decision upheld in another court this April, meaning Amaral is now able to sue the McCanns for damages potentially totalling tens of thousands of pounds.\n\nDuring the interview, BBC presenter Fiona Bruce asked the McCanns: 'One of the police officers in Portugal has been a thorn in your side for many years, he was thrown off the investigation but then he wrote a book ... and you fought it through the courts.\n\n'At the moment you've lost and he's won. Is this the end for you now, are you going to continue to fight him?'\n\nMr McCann replied: 'I think the short answer is we have to because the last judgment I think is terrible.\n\nToday a flower garden in tribute to the 140,000 children who go missing annually in Britain has been opened on the eve of the 10th anniversary of Madeleine McCann's disappearance.\n\nThe floral memorial, nestled deep in the lush green lawns of Chiswick House in west London, was opened with a performance by the Missing People Choir.\n\nThe group, which recently melted hearts on Britain's Got Talent, is made up of families with loved ones who have vanished.\n\nSarah Godwin, whose 18-year-old son Quentin went missing in 1992, said: 'It's absolutely beautiful, I'm stunned.\n\n'It's going to be lovely to come back here, see the plants growing ... and just be able to sit here and think about my son and other missing children.\n\n'My son was a very passionate gardener and kept bees ... so the nature aspect means quite a lot to me.\n\n'Spring has that lovely feeling of warmth and renewal after winter, and May is when my son went missing, so it's pretty powerful.'\n\nThe garden was created by designer Esra Parr, and features many species of forget-me-nots.\n\nIt is part of the charity Missing People's countdown to International Missing Children's Day on May 25.\n\nPeter Boxell, whose son Lee disappeared in 1988, said standing and singing in the garden 'filled me with so much emotion'.\n\nMr Boxell, who wrote the lyrics to the song I Miss You, added singing was 'really healing for us to get our emotions out'.\n\nMissing People chief executive Jo Youle said the permanent floral feature would be a place for families to 'reflect and remember and be reassured that there are others who are thinking of their missing loved one too'. "],[8,"Tories' winter fuel payment policy is 'all over the place' - SNP","The Scottish National Party has warned that taxpayers north of the border could be \"short-changed\" by Conservative plans to preserve the winter fuel payment for all Scottish pensioners while limiting it to the poorest in England and Wales.\n\nSNP pensions spokesman Ian Blackford accused Theresa May of being \"all over the place\" on benefits for the elderly, as he highlighted SNP commitments on welfare and pensions ahead of next week's unveiling of the party's manifesto.\n\nThe SNP is joining Labour and the Liberal Democrats in committing to preserve the \"triple lock\" on state pensions, which guarantees they will rise by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.\n\nWhile the SNP manifesto pledge on the triple lock will extend only to 2022, Mr Blackford indicated that the party was likely to retain the commitment beyond the end of the next parliament, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We've had a commitment to the triple-lock as long as it's been here and I can't imagine any scenario where that would not be the case.\"\n\nMrs May sparked controversy on Friday by revealing that Scottish pensioners would all keep the winter fuel allowance of up to £300 a year under a Tory government, despite the introduction of means-testing in England and Wales.\n\n\"When you look at what they are doing with the winter fuel allowance, they are all over the place, saying different things to different people in different parts of the UK,\" he said.\n\n\"The question is where will the funding come from? Last year, that cost £158 million in Scotland. We need to make sure, if the Conservatives are saying that winter fuel payments are going to be protected, that the funding for that comes from the Westminster Government in order that we can do that.\n\n\"This will become a devolved competency over the course of the lifetime of this parliament so we need to make sure that people in Scotland are not going to be short-changed by the Conservatives.\"\n\nAnd he said the party will continue to fight for so-called \"WASPI women\" born in the 1950s who will lose out from the planned equalisation of the state pension age. But he said the Scottish Government had neither the powers nor the resources to implement by itself the SNP's proposals for an extended transition period.\n\nDefending the SNP decision to keep the triple lock in the face of evidence it will lead to a growing tranche of state spending going to the elderly, Mr Blackford said: \"We have a commitment to keep the triple lock through the lifetime of the next parliament.\n\n\"We still have far too many pensioners in poverty in this country. It's about making sure that we protect the interests of the vulnerable in our society.\n\n\"We've got a situation in the Highlands of Scotland where 77% of pensioners are in fuel poverty. Until we've dealt with that situation, it's quite right that we should protect the interests of this most vulnerable group.\n\n\"What we're not going to do is play off one generation against the other, and that's exactly what this Government is doing.\""],[8,"7 Reasons Voting Tory Means You Hate Your Children","June 8 will be the most important election in a generation, and Britain is preparing itself for a major historical shift in the trajectory of its social and political destiny. Throughout the last 7 years the Conservative Party has executed a programme of systemic vampirism, preying on the vulnerable and the poor, draining the public sector and consistently immiserating the population of Britain.\n\nThe story of Tory Britain is one of austerity. It is a story of unimaginable human cost resulting from massive cuts to the social provisions the state should exist to provide; this includes cuts to education, healthcare, welfare, and indeed the whole public sector. Their policies have seen higher education become increasingly unaffordable, the wealth inequality gap grow further and further, the NHS begin to buckle under new pressure, and the cycle of terrorism and international conflict continue.\n\nWith 68% of young people planning to vote Labour, many have felt incredibly disheartened at conversations shared with Tory supporting family and friends. Many of us know those uncomfortable dinner time debates, the slowly boiling rift of opinions, the side eyes and sighs of consternation.\n\nHow can we explain the truth of the Conservative party in such situations? Beyond the shallow sea of opinions and into the deep oceans of facts, we took it upon ourselves to demonstrate how to use ‘The Kid’s Manifesto: A Guide to Not Voting Conservative’ by offering 7 simple reasons as to why a vote for Theresa May is a vote against your children’s future and the future of generations to come.\n\nhereAll information listed below is compiled and referenced in ‘The Kid’s Manifesto: A Guide to Not Voting Conservative’,  available for free online or downloadable here\n\nIn 2015, the Tories cut£3bnfrom public education funding. Theresa May will continue on this course. It is predicted that almost half of Britain’s teachers will leave their jobs due to overworking, chronic underfunding, and stress.\n\nTheresa May has also pledged to scrap free school dinnersfor over 900,000 children, putting greater strain on families already struggling to make ends meet. The Prime Minister claims this will save up to £3.5m of public money. It is interesting to note that as recently as 2015, politicians were enjoying five course meals in luxury restaurants and the Parliament barat a public cost of £3.7ma year.\n\nUnder the Coalition government tuition fees were increased to £9000 a year, last year the Conservatives granted permission to universities to lift the cap with inflation. That is set to raise fees as high as £11,697 by 2025 – tipping the price of a top degree over £35,000, before additional living costs. The Conservatives also replaced maintenance grants with more loans, adding greater financial pressure for young people from lower income backgrounds.\n\nA Tory future will be one where many schools are understaffed and underfunded, with a  drastic decline in the quality of education. It is also a future where young people will choose not to apply for university degrees and where only the richest will be educated, with universities becoming even more of a market for private profiteering.\n\nA vote for the Conservatives is a vote for the continued attack on every child’s right to learn.\n\nWith George Osbourne already scrapping the £6000 a year student nurses grant unveiled in 2015, with changes imposed to junior doctors’ contracts, and with severe underfunding and budget cuts, the NHS is in crisis. Adult social care and mental health service cuts have increased pressure on many hospitals, all of which are already overstretched and lacking in resources.\n\nThe Conservatives have promised increased investments whilst also reducing and redefining what services are provided by the NHS. This has seriously undermined what should be considered a national institution to be cherished and protected.\n\nThis is all mainly thanks to Jeremy Hunt – the current Health Secretary – who co-authored a book advocating for NHS privatisation. Hunt has already sold off and privatized parts of the NHS, even those that were making money. NHS Privatisation has made young people, as well as most of the adult population, fearful of an American style health system that would leave those unable to afford healthcare to die.\n\nFor many young people, the NHS is not something to be whittled away and thrown into the fire. With the possibility of the eventual collapse of the NHS is a looming reality in the wake of a Conservative victory, a vote for Conservative is a vote forthe destruction of free healthcare in Britain.\n\nUnder the Conservatives, the UK has experienced a housing crisis unlike any other in living memory. With home ownership at its lowest in 29 years, most young people already have no hope of owning a house. Families are now increasingly dependent on rental properties with scant protection from bad landlords. Since 2010 rents have also risen by 15%, largely due to  Tory policy allowing private property tycoons to buy huge swathes of land and former social housing in the UK, especially in London. None of this is surprising considering almost a third of British MPs are also private landlords, and property developers contributed upwards of £3.3m to the Conservative party between 2008-2011 alone.\n\nThe result has been a marked rise in unaffordable housing and an erosion of tenant rights. In 2016, over 43,000 families were made homeless. In February 2017 alone, it was estimated that the equivalent of five families an hour were made homeless. In the UKhomelessness has doubled since David Cameron’s election in 2010. Despite this happening, the Conservatives have continued with their austerity measures, adding insult to injury by making huge cuts to council budgets and homelessness relief bodies.\n\nIf the Conservatives are allowed to continue it is likely jobseekers aged 18 to 21 will also no longer get Housing Benefit to help with their rent. According to homelessness charity Centrepoint this will force thousands of young people on the streets and severely impact children from abusive homes; leaving them faced with a choice between abuse and homelessness.\n\nEvery child deserves shelter and warmth. A vote for the Conservatives is a vote to deny these things to thousands.\n\nWith the natural world facing a crisis unlike anything ever known, future generations are staring down the barrel of a gun: immense ecological damage and a significant impact on human and animal populations – from mass extinction, to deforestation and oceanic pollution.\n\nIt is anthropogenic climate change that is likely to have the biggest consequences for human civilisation and for much of life on Earth. This is agreed on by 97% of scientists, and it is caused by an enormous amount of carbon emissions – primarily due to the consumption of fossil fuels as well as the industrial production of other gases such as methane.\n\nThe technology for a greener economy is available, but the fossil fuel industry is fighting tooth and nail to propagate lies about climate change and encourage countries to continue investing in dirty energy, and practicing the damaging resource extraction techniques necessary for fossil fuels.\n\nBetween October 2013 and March 2015 11 fossil fuel trade bodies spent over £39m lobbying British and European policymakers, and the Conservatives, under the leadership of Theresa May, received over £390,000 from the oil industry in 2017 alone.\n\nWith the Conservatives having already legalised fracking (a highly controversial and damaging method of extracting shale gas) under national parks in 2015, they remain the only major political party in the UK that do not oppose the method; Theresa May described fracking as ‘a revolution’ in energy in her 2017 manifesto.\n\nThis is hardly surprising considering the Conservatives and the British fossil fuel industries responsible for fracking are notoriously close, with many ex-Tories going onto to serve in this industry and maintaining contact with government. These ties may also explain the attack on renewable energy alternatives, with cuts of 64% made to small household solar panels funding and the exclusion of onshore wind farms in a 2016 subsidy scheme.\n\nThe Conservative relationship with animal rights is also horrific. Alongside Theresa May’s vocal support for fox hunting, the pledge to ban all ivory products has also disappeared from the Conservative 2017 manifesto – despite many experts describing this tactic as the only way to truly combat elephant poaching. Likewise, under the Conservatives, thousands of badgers have been slaughtered in a cull that has been scientifically proven as ineffective and pointless in controlling the spread of bovine tuberculosis.\n\nThis is merely a glimpse of the legacy that will be left for young people in the UK – and it will only get worse under another Tory government. If the Conservatives win, children today will be facing a future severely affected by the destruction of the UK’s natural habitats, further pollution, increased climate change, and the exhaustion of fossil fuels without renewable alternatives.\n\nThe Conservatives have repeatedly expressed that they would scrap the Human Rights Act and replace it with the British Bill of rights – this pledge has been in Tory manifestos since 2010. The Tories also have a terrible record in addressing domestic violence in the UK; with further austerity measures shutting down ever more refuge centres for women, and putting pressure on victim support funding for LGBT people. We have also seen the proliferation of detention centres, such as Yarl’s Wood, which hold refugees of all ages and genders, and are run by corporate security contractors such as G4S and Serco. Many of these facilities have reported mistreatment of detained refugees, including racist abuse, sexual harassment, and even rape.\n\nUnder the Conservatives, Britain has also become the world’s second largest arms exporter and their hardline stance on defence, including extensive British military interventionism in the Middle, has caused huge ‘blowback’ (the intelligence term for unintended domestic consequences of military operations) in the form of terrorism. Furthermore, Britain has sold up to £3.3bn worth of arms to states such as Saudi Arabia; who are known for funding ISIS as well as conducting their own brutal war on Yemen (a conflict which has now displaced upwards of 3m people.) Despite this, the Conservative foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued to urge the Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, to continue selling these weapons to Saudi Arabia. This is one example of the Conservatives pathologically deranged and irresponsible foreign policy.\n\nAt home, the Conservatives have also overseen increased impoverishment – with the number of people using food banks in the UK rising from 43,000 (when Cameron came to power in the coalition) to a staggering 1.2m. The decimation of support for people with chronic illnesses and disabilities is another legacy of the Conservatives: the Department for Work and Pensions revealed that2,380 people died between December 2011 and February 2014 after being declared ‘fit for work’. This is the direct human cost of the Conservatives austerity policies – and proof that cuts cost lives.\n\nFormer Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith also made sure that MP’s no longer have to scrutinise child poverty target figures in the House of Commons. The Conservatives even managed to erase the term ‘Child Poverty’ from the Child Poverty Act, renaming it the ‘Life Chances Act’ – just as they did with the ‘Child Poverty and Social Mobility Commission’, now simply ‘Social Mobility Commission’.\n\nA vote for the Conservatives is vote for a future of war, terror, oppression, and poverty.\n\nUnder the past seven years of Conservative leadership, state surveillance has massively increased. The Snoopers’ Charter gives wide ranging powers which include the right to hack devices, look at web history, and infect devices with malware and spyware. With almost no oversight or any real way of holding accountability, we are handing over all of our privacy and our intimate lives – to be surveiled, gathered, collected, stored, and analysed.\n\n‘Nothing to hide, nothing to fear’: this buzz phrase is often used by government to justify surveillance and the violation of privacy rights. The phrase has been employed by Conservative politicians such as the ex foreign secretary William Hague as well as Tory MP Richard Graham, who caused controversy after using the phrase in Parliament – as the words have been previously associated with Nazi Minister of Information, Joseph Goebbels. The narrative that surveillance is solely for the purpose of preventing domestic terrorism becomes destabilised when we understand that in fact, bulk surveillance and big data processing is inefficient, unwieldy, and has not been shown to increase the state’s counter terrorism ability.\n\nYoung people today have grown up with a significant portion of their lives using the internet, and tend to be the most intensive user, making them particularly at risk. A right to privacy on the internet is no different from a right to privacy in your own home. A vote for  the Conservatives is a vote for the party that has committed itself to curtailing these rights, and, if allowed, will do so for years to come.\n\nAfter Brexit, with economic uncertainty on the horizon, the Conservatives have tried to portray themselves as the most economically competent party. However, largely thanks to George Osbourne chancellorship, the UK is now among worst performing advanced economies in the world – despite the proclaimed benefits of austerity.\n\nGeorge Osbourne missed or delayed his targets on shrinking the deficit again and again, at one point, even only a month after setting them. The devastating effects of austerity have not been grounded in economic science, with many experts warning that austerity actually leads to greater economic disaster and wealth inequality. Indeed, the interesting question remains as to how, even amidst this freeze on spending and the regime of austerity, Britain’s billionaires have seen their net worth more than double since the recession, with the richest 1,000 families now controlling a total of £547bn. As much wealth as the poorest 40% in the UK.\n\nFurthermore, during the reign of the Conservatives, young people have faced the unfettered proliferation of zero hour contracts that enable bosses to legally change shifts each week. Whilst they can offer flexibility, they also can risk reducing work hours to zero without notice or redundancy rights. Unemployment also remains high, and what work there is is often in low paying gig economy jobs which exploit legal loopholes and undeveloped regulations – such as Uber and Deliveroo. The growth of the gig economy and zero hour contracts has particularly affected young people who need to fend for themselves. For under 25s unemployment is at 18.5% and many claiming jobseekers have already faced the prospect of losing benefits under the Conservative’s Work Programme (discontinued in April after years of militant grassroots opposition) which forced Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants into performing unpaid labour under pain of benefit sanctions.\n\nMany young people, after a prolonged feeling of apathy and disillusionment with establishment politics, are now turning towards Jeremy Corbyn, because they recognise that there is now hope to pick up the shattered pieces of history and try to reassemble Britain’s future. But it is up to the older generation – the parents, the aunts, the uncles, the grandparents – to now take responsibility for their decisions and the material consequences that their vote will have on their children’s world. The young represent the future; the Conservatives a toxic past which they do not want to inherit.\n\nA note from the authors:\n\nAfter having many difficult and problematic conversations with family or friends who were committed to voting Conservative in the upcoming general election on the 8th June, we wanted to examine the truth behind the last 7 years of Tory government and condense it all into a simple, accessible and widely sourced investigative report.\n\nThe report explores the impact of Conservative government in almost every aspect of life in the UK.\n\nWe hope it can become a useful tool for anyone hoping to educate, inform and persuade their friends and familyto vote in a fashion that does not condemn them and future generations to a poorer quality of life and the inevitable suffering that will arise from another Conservative victory.\n\nWith love,\n\nThe KM Collective"],[8,"Grenfell Tower victims 'murdered by political decisions' – John McDonnell","John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has claimed that the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire were “murdered by political decisions”, saying politicians’ decisions over recent decades were important factors in the deaths of 79 people in the tower block in north Kensington, London.\n\nAddressing a debate on Sunday at the Glastonbury festival, in Somerset, chaired by the Guardian’s John Harris, McDonnell said: “Is democracy working? It didn’t work if you were a family living on the 20th floor of Grenfell Tower. Those families, those individuals – 79 so far and there will be more – were murdered by political decisions that were taken over recent decades.”\n\nThe strength of the language used by the MP, whose Hayes and Harlington constituency is a few miles from the site of the tower block fire, will anger some Conservative MPs who have accused Labour of trying to politicise a disaster.\n\nMcDonnell added that housing provision was now driven by profitability instead of need. “The decisions not to build homes and to view housing as only for financial speculation rather than for meeting a basic human need, made by politicians over decades, murdered those families,” he said. “The decision to close fire stations and to cut 10,000 firefighters and then to freeze their pay for over a decade contributed to those deaths inevitably and they were political decisions.”\n\nMcDonnell’s intervention came amid continuing tension in Camden, north London, where the local council is trying to persuade remaining residentsto leave their homes in tower blocks where most have been evacuated.\n\nThousands of residents have left their homes on the Chalcots estate after an evacuation operation which began Friday to clear the buildings because of an “unacceptable fire risk”. Some residents said they had been intimidated by security guards.\n\nThe effort to clear the estate comes after the government revealed that all of the 34 high-rises that submitted building cladding samples for inspection after the Grenfell Tower disaster failed combustibility tests. Hundreds more blocks have still to be tested.\n\nThe Glastonbury debate took place on Sunday in the Left Field a day after Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, drew a crowd of thousands to the Pyramid stage. McDonnell appeared with the Green party’s co-leader Jonathan Bartley, and Faiza Shaheen, an economist.\n\nMcDonnell’s words echoed the claims of the Labour MP Diane Abbott, who told a Progress meeting on Saturday that the final death toll from the Grenfell Tower would exceed 100 and blamed the disaster on Conservative attitudes towards social housing.\n\nShe said: “The Tories think people in social housing are second-class citizens. And, as we have seen from Grenfell [Tower], they are offering them second-class standards of safety. So, a direct consequence of that, a direct consequence of outsourcing … and a direct consequence of deregulation.”\n\nMcDonnell repeatedly drew cheers from the crowds when he spoke of the need for electoral reform and changes to the House of Lords. He called for a “progressive intellectual alliance” between parties to rebuild what was needed for a democracy. “The House of Lords – 92 of them are there on the basis of who Charles II shagged at some point in the past,” he said. “It can’t be right that we have a House of Lords that’s based upon those people appointed rather than elected.”\n\nMcDonnell told the audience: “We have been beating our heads against a brick wall for 30 years,” he said. “We are on the edge of a huge victory.”\n\nMcDonnell said he and Corbyn had been trying to achieve honest politics for the past two years despite media attacks. He said some sections of the press “came after us and tried to destroy us because we stood up to the establishment and the elite”."],[8,"Dalits convert to protest","A Jatav home in Shabbirpur that was torched by Thakurs. Picture by JP Yadav Lucknow, May 19: At least 180 Dalit families from three western Uttar Pradesh villages claim to have embraced Buddhism \"in protest against the atrocities on Dalits under the Yogi Adityanath government\". Residents of Idhari, Roopadi and Kapoorpur in Saharanpur district, 600km northwest of Lucknow, gathered in Mankamau village last evening and threw idols and pictures of Hindu gods and goddesses into the Badi Nahar canal to signal their abandonment of their previous faith. The incident carries echoes of a milestone protest six decades ago when atrocities against Dalits had prompted Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar to adopt Buddhism with a group of followers on October 14, 1956. Asked why they had converted, the Saharanpur Dalits referred to a May 5 clash between Thakurs and the Dalit Jatavs in Shabbirpur village in the same district and argued that Adityanath's government \"belongs only to his fellow Thakurs\". Last Sunday, about 50 Dalit families in Moradabad, 200km east of Saharanpur, too had cited the Shabbirpur violence and threatened to abandon Hinduism if Adityanath did not stop the attacks on Dalits by the \"saffron brigade\". \"Dalits were attacked and their homes and agricultural fields burnt down in Shabbirpur. Our caste brethren were arrested and now the state government wants to link our social organisation with Maoists,\" said Narendra Gautam, one of those who claimed to have converted to Buddhism in Saharanpur. \"Our social organisation\" was a reference to the Bhim Army, which describes itself as a non-violent and apolitical organisation formed to unite and help Dalits but is facing a police crackdown in western Uttar Pradesh. Rahul Gautam, another purported convert to Buddhism, said: \"We support the Bhim Army because it makes us aware of our socio-political situation and unites the community to raise a collective voice. But the BJP government and the Hindu vigilante groups don't want us to be united.\" Police officers accuse the Bhim Army of leading a violent Dalit protest against the Shabbirpur clashes in Saharanpur city on May 9. The outfit is also accused of planning further violence in Saharanpur and Delhi, and circulating \"objectionable\" videos and messages on Facebook and WhatsApp against Adityanath. Rahul and his fellow Dalits did not provide details of how exactly they had converted, and who conducted the rituals. They, however, identified the immediate provocation: a police raid yesterday morning on a house in Chapur village and the arrest of five Dalits on the charge of being Bhim Army members. \"They were planning a violent protest in the city. Pawan Gautam, at whose home the meeting was going on, is a member of the Bhim Army,\" said M.P. Singh, station house officer of Sahsawa police station that conducted the raid. Pawan told reporters at the police station that it was not a crime to be a member of a lawful organisation. Subhas Chandra Dubey, Saharanpur senior superintendent of police, denied hearing about any religious conversion in the district. \"We are taking unbiased action against whosoever is involved in violence and hate-mongering,\" he said. A few days ago, Dubey had alleged that the Bhim Army's operations resembled those of a Maoist outfit. Officers have so far, however, failed to produce any evidence before the media that the Bhim Army possesses firearms. Police records show that the May 9 protesters carried only stones and sticks. The police, who had already registered a case against Bhim Army founder Chandra Shekhar for \"instigating Dalits to violence\", lodged a fresh case against him and his friend Vikas Meshram today over certain videos and messages. \"I have received the screen shot of a WhatsApp message from Vikas's number that contained objectionable remarks against the chief minister,\" said Piyush Dixit, officer in charge of Sadar police station in Saharanpur city. Manish Bist, a sub-inspector, told reporters he had received a similar video clip from Chandra Shekhar's mobile number. \"Such messages and clips are in circulation on many social networking sites. They have appealed to Dalits to assemble at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on May 21 (to protest attacks on Dalits in Uttar Pradesh),\" Bist said. Chandra Shekhar, said to be a Saharanpur native, remains a somewhat shadowy figure. The police believe he is a lawyer. He apparently founded the Bhim Army in 2008 but it became active in a big way only two years ago. Some police sources, however, said that western Uttar Pradesh was home to at least a dozen organisations that called themselves the Bhim Army. K.L. Gupta, former Uttar Pradesh police chief, blamed \"Hindu vigilante groups associated with the ruling party\" for the tensions. \"They have become very active since Adityanath's elevation as chief minister two months ago. Adityanath should control their unlawful activities if he wants the other side to maintain peace,\" Gupta said. On May 9, BJP and Bajrang Dal activists had surrounded a house at Raniyala Dayalpur village in Saharanpur and beaten up two young men, alleging they were encouraging Dalits to abandon Hinduism. The vigilantes forced the police to take the two men into custody. Chhote Singh, officer in charge of the local Nakud police station, later said the allegations against the duo were \"fiction\" and released them. The May 5 violence in Shabbirpur had taken place when a procession by Thakurs, sporting saffron scarves and marking the birth anniversary of 16th-century Rajput king Maharana Pratap, entered Jatav settlements. The Dalits claim they were attacked first. Over two dozen people suffered injuries and a young Thakur died - killed mistakenly by his caste brethren, the Dalits claim. The incident is seen as a sign of rising Dalit assertiveness in the region. A police officer had told this newspaper last week that \"Shabbirpur and a couple of other villages are like tinderboxes that can explode anytime\". Mahesh Prasad Ahirwar, a Dalit activist and professor of ancient history and culture at Banaras Hindi University, had recalled that since Ambedkar's protest, many Dalit families had converted to Buddhism in the face of upper caste oppression. He said that buoyed by their election victory, Hindu radicals were \"showing their true colours but were forgetting that their numbers would fall drastically if the 22 per cent Dalits discard Hinduism\". Ahirwar believes that Dalits could convert to other religions in large numbers across the state \"in the coming days\"."],[8,"Lawyer who says Palestinians don't exist sues San Francisco university","A lawyer who denies that Palestinians exist is suing San Francisco State University, alleging the administration there fosters a hostile environment for Jewish students.\n\nBut faculty and civil rights lawyers say the lawsuit, filed on behalf of six plaintiffs, is yet another attempt at censorship by conflating criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.\n\nThe complaint, filed in federal court in Northern California on 19 June, was prepared by The Lawfare Project, a group that describes itself as “the legal arm of the pro-Israel community.”\n\nLast year, the group’s director, Brooke Goldstein, was filmed asking Israel lobby leaders in New York, “Why are we using the word Palestinian?”\n\n“There’s no such thing as a Palestinian person,” Goldstein asserted:\n\nIn the same speech, Goldstein also revealed new strategies to undermine the movement for Palestinian rights, including preparing legal challenges against US institutions, among them specifically San Francisco State University.\n\n“The goal is to make the enemy pay,” Goldstein explained.\n\nThe Lawfare Project says that the lawsuit was filed after the US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it would be “scaling back” investigations of alleged discrimination on campuses around the country.\n\nClaiming that San Francisco State University is “among the worst of the worst” campuses for Jewish students, the plaintiffs, three students and three area residents, say administrators have “fostered, fomented and systematically instilled an anti-Jewish animus” on the campus.\n\nThe 73-page complaint lists about a dozen incidents, some dating back to the early 1990s – before many of the university’s current students would have been born – in an attempt to paint of picture of systematic discrimination.\n\nNearly all of those incidents involve disputes between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian communities on campus, including the disruption of an event last year featuring the Israeli mayor of Jerusalem Nir Barkat.\n\nIsrael’s municipality includes occupied East Jerusalem, which no country recognizes as part of Israel.\n\n“The incidents they are complaining about involve activism for Palestinian rights, which is political speech that is protected by the First Amendment,” Dima Khalidi, director of Palestine Legal, told The Electronic Intifada.\n\n“The whole premise of their complaint relies on the conflation of anti-Jewish animus and criticism of Israeli policies,” Khalidi added. “That’s where the complaint is going to fail.”\n\nThe lawsuit invokes the State Department definition of anti-Semitism, which describes much criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic.\n\nThe definition has no legal force, but Israel lobby groups have been been pressing institutions and governments around the world, including the US Congress, to formally adopt it.\n\nBut even Kenneth Stern, the former American Jewish Committee executive who authored the definition, has vigorously opposed its adoption into legislation, warning that it would be used by Israel advocacy groups to police speech.\n\nStern told US lawmakers in December that legislating the definition would be “unconstitutional and unwise” and would “actually harm Jewish students and have a toxic effect on the academy.”\n\nIn recent years, Israel lobby groups have urged the Department of Education to investigate Palestine advocacy as a potential violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act – landmark legislation that requires administrators to ensure campuses are free from a pervasive atmosphere of bias.\n\nBut in 2013, the strategy hit a dead end as the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights threw out a slew of Title VI complaints against the University of California campuses at Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Irvine, where there had been active Palestine solidarity campaigns.\n\nKhalidi says it is revealing that The Lawfare Project is now citing the State Department definition in its lawsuit.\n\n“This is about an effort to categorize any and all criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic and crush a growing movement that is looking critically at Israel,” she said.\n\nWhile painting a lurid broad-brush picture of anti-Jewish hatred on campus, the lawsuit is centered on only two specific incidents: a protest of Israeli government official Nir Barkat’s visit in April 2016, and the exclusion of the campus chapter of the Jewish student organization Hillel from a “Know Your Rights” fair in February 2017.\n\nStudents disrupted the Barkat event with chants, forcing his audience to huddle around to hear his speech. Leslie Wong, SFSU’s president, immediately condemned the protest and announced an investigation.\n\nThat investigation upheld the students’ right to protest and found that campus police and administrators acted in accordance with how they had handled protests in the past.\n\nThe investigative report also affirms that “the protestors did not create a credible threat to public safety” and that they “did not engage in any threatening physical conduct or raise any direct threats that could be interpreted as incitement to imminent lawless action.”\n\nYet the lawsuit claims that by not intervening to stop the protest as it happened, the administration violated the audience members’ First Amendment right to hear Barkat.\n\nThis video, posted online by a pro-Israel group, shows Barkat speaking to students gathered around him, while chants of “Free, Free Palestine” can be heard from protesters in the back of the room:\n\nIn the second incident, plaintiffs claim Hillel was barred from a Know Your Rights fair on campus because of its Jewish identity. The university is still investigating the incident.\n\nResponding to the lawsuit, San Francisco State University affirmed its dedication to free speech, diversity and inclusion.\n\nBut its statement repeats the allegation that the protest of Nir Barkat was anti-Semitic.\n\n“The disruption of the event featuring Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat in spring 2016 and bias incidents that were reported this year were ugly reminders that anti-Semitism, like all forms of discrimination, is real and our community has work to do.”\n\nThis new position contradicts the university’s own earlier investigation, which found that the protest targeted Barkat’s politics, not his Jewish identity.\n\n“In the end, the record demonstrates that the protest was directed towards the Mayor of Jerusalem based on his politics, and not towards any of the audience members,” the investigation concluded.\n\nBarkat oversees the ongoing forced displacement of Palestinians from their homes in occupied East Jerusalem to make way for Jewish settlers.\n\nIn 2016, Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank, including Jerusalem, hit a new record.\n\nYet the lawsuit frames the protest against Barkat as an attack on Jewish students on campus, not as political speech against a foreign government’s objectionable behavior.\n\nThe complaint alleges for instance that protesters “had every intention of making the Jews in the room feel intimidated and that they reveled in threatening them.”\n\nSuch assertions manufacture the anti-Semitism the lawsuit claims to expose, by identifying all Jews with Israel and Israel with all Jews. This is absurd on its face, not least because Israeli settlements are illegal under international law and are opposed not only by Palestinians and dozens of governments but by also by many Jewish groups and activists, including Israelis.\n\nThe lawsuit also describes the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement for Palestinian rights as “inherently anti-Semitic.” It attempts to link BDS activists to “terrorist” organizations.\n\nIt even claims that murdered Palestinian cartoonist Naji al-Ali’s iconic character Handala – a child holding a key who represents Palestinian refugees’ desire to return home – is “an established anti-Semitic symbol.”\n\nThe image of a key is often used by Palestinians as a reminder of the houses they left behind in the Nakba – the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine. But to the plaintiffs, “the key represents the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state.”\n\nAnother target of the lawsuit is San Francisco State University’s historic College of Ethnic Studies.\n\n“Unfortunately, part of the legacy that evolved from [the College of Ethnic Studies] has been an extremely disturbing pattern of blatant anti-Jewish animus at SFSU,” the complaint claims.\n\nThe first of its kind, the College of Ethnic Studies was founded in 1969 after the Black Student Union and the Third World Liberation Front waged the longest campus strike in US history, starting the year before.\n\nIt quickly became a model for Black and ethnic studies programs across the country.\n\nIn 2007, in the same spirit, San Francisco State University founded the Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas Initiative. Professor Rabab Abdulhadi, who teaches in the department, is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, along with the dean of the College of Ethnic Studies.\n\nThe university’s statement responding to the lawsuit does not mention or defend the college.\n\nAbdulhadi has been the repeated target of Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian attacks by Israel advocates.\n\n“These right-wing, pro-Israeli groups are well funded but tiny,” Abdulhadi told The Electronic Intifada. “They don’t represent a consensus of the Jewish community.”\n\n“They are trying to stop the scholarship and activism on campus,” she added. “They are attacking the spirit of 1968.”"],[8,"EU negotiators steeled for post-election Brexit crisis","EU negotiators are bracing themselves for a “big crisis” over Brexit soon after this week’s UK election, including a possible walkout as early as the summer or autumn.\n\nAlarmed by an election campaign that has stoked up tensions between UK and continental European leaders, Brussels is hoping for reassurances over Britain’s negotiating team and answers on whether the UK will reject outright the EU’s divorce-first timetable for talks.\n\nThe negotiations could dominate the new British government’s time in office.\n\nThe European Commission is expected to make contacts with London to organise the talks within days of the election on June 8.\n\nA formal negotiating round is planned for June 19 or 20, a week that ends with an EU summit on the anniversary of the Brexit referendum.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has promised to send position papers on citizen rights and the financial settlement “very quickly” after the election. Brussels wants both issues to be addressed before the start of talks on a “future relationship” between Britain and the bloc.\n\nWhile surprised by polls that indicate Labour may be narrowing the gap with the ruling Conservatives, most European capitals still expect prime minister Theresa May to secure a new mandate. But they are unimpressed by Mrs May’s claim that “every vote for the Conservatives will make me stronger when I negotiate for Britain”.\n\nOne negotiator said: “Frankly the size of the majority does not matter to us.”\n\nThe EU side is more worried about a clash in the two sides’ approach to the talks, particularly if Mrs May takes personal charge of negotiations, attempts to bargain with the 27 leaders at the EU summit, and refuses to engage over a financial settlement before trade talks begin.\n\nThe EU wants an upfront gross payment of up to€100bn to settle Britain’s Brexit bill and insists that talks be strictly sequenced. Mrs May calls such demands “aggressive” while David Davis, Brexit secretary, has said the UK will lay down its own “ground rules” for the negotiations.\n\n“All the talk is over the big crisis, the walkout, and if it will be in the summer or October,” said one EU ambassador in Brussels. “We know it is coming.”\n\nA eurozone foreign minister said the question of money “will be really tough”, agreeing with Mr Davis that the Brexit bill will be “the row of the summer”.\n\nWhile the EU27 have approved a detailed negotiating mandate for Mr Barnier, London has yet to respond in kind on policy, or assign responsibilities for the negotiation. That has reinforced a sense in other EU capitals that Britain is ill-prepared; one senior EU figure involved in Brexit talks called it “a shambles”.\n\nBritish officials are insisting to European diplomats that it is “for Britain to decide” who leads their negotiations. This has sparked concerns in Brussels that Mrs May will attempt to turn this month’s EU summit into a Brexit negotiation on citizen rights.\n\n“If she tries that she will be given a cold shower,” said one senior diplomat on the EU side.\n\nMrs May has given some EU officials the impression she wants her “sherpa” Olly Robbins, a senior civil servant, to discreetly handle technical talks on her behalf, rather than Mr Davis taking day-to-day charge.\n\n“We are not hung up about how senior they are. What we need is somebody who is empowered to actually take commitments, who is available, and accountable,” the senior EU diplomat said, noting that Mr Barnier wanted press conferences at the beginning and end of each negotiation round.\n\n“You cannot make progress if you have somebody there who cannot commit and who cannot sell it [commitments] to the public. That is a real risk.”\n\nBritain is looking for an early agreement on citizen rights and Mr Davis has promised a “generous offer” on the status of the 3m EU migrants in Britain.\n\nBut it is much less clear whether the UK is ready even to engage in discussions about a financial settlement. The tenor of the first engagements will be crucial.\n\nSeveral senior diplomats on the EU side say they are looking for signs that the UK is aiming at a workable deal, and understands the compromises that will be required.\n\nIf the UK explains why it disagrees with the EU’s financial demands that may constitute the start of a negotiation, some EU officials say. But if the country refuses to address such issues at the start of talks, then the negotiations may be much more fraught.\n\n“If they were just to come and say: your sequencing, forget it, we will not talk about financial settlement without talking about the future relationship, then we have a problem,” said another senior EU diplomat working on Brexit."],[8,"The U.K. Election Wasn’t That Much Of A Shock","Despite betting markets and expert forecasts that predicted Theresa May’s Conservatives to win a large majority in the U.K. parliamentary elections, the Tories instead lost ground on Thursday, resulting in a hung parliament. As we write this in the early hours of Friday morning, Conservatives will end up with either 318 or 319 seats, down from the 330 that the Tories had in the previous government. A majority officially requires 326 seats.\n\nConservatives will wind up with the plurality of seats and the plurality of the popular vote. It’s still possible — indeed, probable — that Conservatives will form a government, either as a minority government or as part of a coalition, most likely with the Democratic Unionist Party, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland. By contrast, a coalition between Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party (which lost a significant number of seats) would have about 310 seats — short of a majority. It’s also probable that May will continue as Conservative leader and prime minister, the BBC reports.\n\nWith 42 to 43 percent of the vote, in fact, the Tories should wind up with their largest vote share since under Margaret Thatcher. But the outcome isn’t being interpreted as any sort of moral victory for May; instead, it’s being portrayed in the British media as a disaster. That’s because at the time May unexpectedly called for a “snap” election seven weeks ago, polls showed Conservatives leading Labour by 17 percentage points and poised to win as many as 400 seats in parliament. Instead, they went backward and are at best hanging on by a thread. It’s even plausible that there could be another election later this year.\n\nAnd yet, the results should not have been all that surprising if one followed this year’s polling and the polling history of the U.K. closely. The final polling average showed conservatives ahead by 6.4 percentage points. In fact, Conservatives should wind up winning the popular vote by 2 to 3 percentage points. That means the polling average will have been off by about 4 percentage points. (The table below lists YouGov twice because they polled the race using two different methods.)\n\nWhile a 4-point error would be fairly large in the context of a U.S. presidential election, it’s completely normal in the case of the U.K. On average in U.K. elections since World War II, the final set of polls have missed the Conservative-Labour margin by 3.9 percentage points, almost exactly in line with this year’s error.\n\nAs has been the case in several recent elections, therefore, the problem was not so much with the polls, or at least not with some of the polls. The problem was with how people were interpreting them. Betting markets on Thursday morning showed Conservatives with only about a 15 percent chance of failing to achieve a majority. In our view, this was unrealistically low given that their lead in the polling average was close to the Tories’ winning margin in 2015 (6.5 percentage points), which had barely been enough for a majority. Taken at face value, the polls suggested a result wherein Conservatives took barely over half the seats, not a blowout.\n\nBut while pollsters had middling results on the whole, some did much better than others. Indeed, the polls in the lead-up to this election showed a wide range of outcomes, with final polls showing margins that ranged from Labour +3 to Conservatives +13. There were a number of pollsters who had results very close to the final outcome, including Survation, Kantar Public, Norstat and SurveyMonkey. That’s far different than what occurred two years ago in the 2015 U.K. election, when all but two polls had the election within a narrow range between Labour +1 to Conservatives +1. That had been a sign of pollsters “herding” toward a consensus instead of behaving independently.\n\nAlthough pollsters may not have herded in this election, however, some of them were guilty of another sin: distrusting their own data. After the 2015 election, many pollsters applied much more aggressive turnout models which weighted down the number of younger voters who are generally more favorable to Labour. In turn, they boosted the percentage of older voters, who are generally more friendly toward the Conservatives.\n\nGiven the substantial age gap in this election, the turnout weighting had an especially big effect. Among the final polls, seven of them adjusted their results in this way, in all but one case yielding a more friendly result for the Conservatives. You can see this in the table below, which looks at the raw results for these seven pollsters and their adjusted results. The average difference was nearly 6 percentage points in Tories’ favor. That’s a huge gap. In 2015, such adjustments had shifted the results by only about 1 point toward Conservatives. And likely voter models in U.S. presidential elections typically only move the numbers by a couple of percentage points in either direction (usually toward Republicans).\n\nThese adjustments proved to be counterproductive in the U.K. The average “raw” result from these polls — which applied demographic weights but otherwise relied on voters’ self-reported likelihood to vote instead of complicated turnout models — showed a 2.7 percentage point lead for the Conservatives, very close to their actual results. But the “headline” version of the polls, which applied the turnout models and removed or reallocated undecided voters, showed an 8.3-percentage point lead for the Conservatives instead.\n\nAlthough polling the U.K. is hard, we’re not very sympathetic to the pollsters who made these adjustments. That’s because turnout models were probably not the cause of the Conservative underestimation in 2015. According to a report prepared by the British Polling Council and the Market Research Society, the error had more to do with the fact that the initial samples were unrepresentative of the overall population.\n\nThe 2017 election therefore seems to be a case of an overcorrection. The pollsters apparently did a good enough job of weighting the raw samples properly, which got them fairly close to the right outcome. Then on top of that, some of them gave extra weight to the Conservatives through their turnout models. As a result, they discounted signs of a youth-driven Labour turnout surge. As was the case in the U.S. with Bernie Sanders, younger voters turned out in a big way for Labour’s left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn. It’s one thing for a pollster to get an outcome wrong because voters fail to turn out when they say they will. But if voters tell you they’re going to turn out, you ignore them, and they show up to vote anyway, you really don’t have much of a defense.\n\nThe overall theme is that many people who covered the U.K. election (whether as pollsters or pundits or journalists) were guilty of fighting the last war. It’s true that Conservatives have some history of outperforming their polls in the U.K. and had done so in 2015. Yet, those previous underestimations may have occurred just by chance or for reasons peculiar to each election. Many people were so preoccupied with not underestimating Conservatives that they failed to consider how they might be underestimating Labour instead. Thus, they largely ignored the possibility of a hung parliament despite its being an entirely realistic outcome. (We estimated the chances of it to be about 1 in 3.)\n\nBut if the results ought not to have been much of a surprise given where the polls stood on Thursday morning, what about where they stood in April, when May called the election as Conservatives led by 17 percentage points? While this is a trickier case, we’re still not sure the outcome should be considered all that shocking.\n\nWhen May called the election, we noted that she was undertaking a risky move because the U.K. polls had historically been volatile (in addition to not being very accurate even at the end of the campaign). And there were some reasons to expect an especially large amount of volatility in this race. The election was unexpected, so voters had only about 50 days to get to know the candidates. May had only become prime minister last July and might still have been in her “honeymoon period” when she skated above the partisan fray — something that was bound to change once she asked voters to go to the polls again. A better economy traditionally boosts the incumbent party, but the British economy wasn’t doing all that well. And U.K. elections are typically fairly close — only three of them since World War II have been decided by double-digit popular vote margins — so there was some risk of reversion to the mean.\n\nThere were also a lot of events during the campaign, but the compressed time frame makes them hard to sort out from one another. How much did the Conservative manifesto hurt the Tories? Did terrorist attacks in Manchester and London work against them? Was May’s perceived softness toward President Trump a factor, especially after Trump began to attack London Mayor Sadiq Khan? Given the results of the French election, is there an overall resurgence toward liberal multiculturalism in Europe, perhaps as a reaction to Trump? We don’t know the answers to these questions, although we hope to explore some of them in the coming days. We do know that elections around the world are putting candidates, pollsters and the media to the test, and there isn’t a lot they can be taking for granted."],[8,"Theresa May hung out to dry: PM clings on to power with DUP bailout","Theresa May is clinging to power by her fingertips through a hasty deal with 10 Northern Ireland MPs.\n\nThe Prime Minister was forced to beg for a lifeline from the Democratic Unionist Party after tossing away her Commons majority in a catastrophic election gamble.\n\nIt leaves the Tory leader a weakened occupant of Downing Street, potentially a prisoner of the DUP and backbench factions — a shadow of the all-powerful landslide winner she imagined when she called the snap election.\n\nA DUP source said the party would keep Jeremy Corbyn from toppling Mrs May. “IRA sympathisers will never do a deal with us,” they added. But the party is expected to drive a hard bargain — and has a history of exploiting narrow majorities to extract favours from Westminster governments. \n\nThere were hints from some supporters that Mrs May could be out in two years, after conducting Brexit talks. \n\nHer authority drained away in a night of shock that sent sterling plunging, as the world weighed in horror the implications for Brexit negotiations, which are due to start in 10 days. \n\nBut in a speech to supporters in the early hours the Prime Minister signalled her plan to cling on by stressing the need for “a period of stability”. She then spent an agonising morning phoning Cabinet members to shore up her position amid some calls for her to resign for, in one MP’s words, “steering the liner on to the rocks”.\n\nWith the Conservatives eight seats short of a Commons majority, Mrs May rang DUP leader Arlene Foster to strike exactly the sort of bargain she had claimed her opponents would resort to in a “coalition of chaos”.\n\nTory sources could not say if the two women had discussed a coalition, which some Right-wingers would prefer, or a less formal deal involving horse-trading in return for key votes. One Tory source said: “I wouldn’t say a deal has been done. The DUP has made clear they will work for us, but the precise nature of that will emerge in due course.”\n\nMs Foster, who was recently mired in a massive energy subsidies scandal, was making the most of her transformed position. She said it was “too soon to say” what would happen and mused that it would be “difficult for her [Mrs May] to survive”. \n\nAt 10.15am Downing Street was finally able to announce that Mrs May would see the Queen at 12.30pm to seek permission to form a government. \n\nMs Foster is understood to have given an assurance that the DUP is ready to support the Government. The details will await consultations between the two parties over the weekend.\n\nTories were furious at the election shambles. Ex-minister Anna Soubry called on Mrs May to “consider her position” following a “disastrous” campaign. Tory MPs were sharpening their knives for the Prime Minister’s closest aides, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill.\n\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson, often tipped as a successor to Mrs May, said: “We’ve got to listen to our constituents and listen to their concerns.” \n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said he would “fight tooth and nail” to keep Mrs May in post. “The simple truth is we have a Prime Minister, she is a very good leader, I’m a big supporter of hers,” he said.\n\nWith all but one seat counted during a night of unbelievable political drama, some of the key points today were: \n\nAfter 649 results, the Commons was divided as follows: Conservatives, 318 (-12); Labour, 261 (+29); SNP, 35 (-21); Liberal Democrats, 12 (+4); DUP, 10 (+2); Others, 13.\n\nMr Corbyn said Labour had “won this election” after its best vote share since 2001, at 40 per cent, fuelled by an extraordinary turnout of students and young supporters. Former Tory MP Matthew Parris dubbed it “the revenge of the young on the older generation” for last year’s Brexit vote. \n\nSenior MPs said they will demand that Mrs May consult backbenchers and Cabinet ministers about policies as part of the price of her keeping her job.\n\nOne supporter of Mrs May suggested she could stay on for Brexit negotiations and fall on her sword in 2019. “She won’t be PM for a decade now, but we need her for the next two years,” said the minister. “There’s no time for a Tory leadership election and no clear and quick replacement.” \n\nThe first tremors of the third political earthquake in two years came at 10pm last night, when an exit poll by Ipsos MORI predicted a hung Parliament. \n\nInteractive map: London election results\n\nAt first there was disbelief on all sides. But as the trickle of results turned into a flood in the early hours, it was clear that the Prime Minister’s gamble had backfired spectacularly.\n\nAmong unexpected Labour gains were Canterbury, Battersea and Warwick. The Conservative seat of Kensington went to a third recount. However, the Tories made gains in some old Labour strongholds, including Mansfield.\n\nAmong the smaller parties, Tim Farron’s Liberal Democrats were buoyed by the return of big beasts Sir Vince Cable and Sir Ed Davey. Ukip was crushed, however, with voters splitting between Labour and the Conservatives. Leader Paul Nuttall came third in the Lincolnshire seat he fought and later announced his resignation.\n\nThe pound dropped two per cent against the dollar and the euro, but it remained above levels seen when the Prime Minister called the snap election in April. Experts thought a weakened Mrs May had less chance of pushing through a hard Brexit that would be more damaging for the economy and the currency. \n\nFrom Brussels, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator, gloated: “Yet another own goal, after Cameron now May, will make already complex negotiations even more complicated.”\n\nMs Soubry was the first Tory MP to suggest Mrs May should go. “This has been a disaster, the results are dreadful,” she said.\n\nLord Turnbull, the former Cabinet secretary who sits as a crossbencher, said Mrs May “wasn’t up to it” and should resign. He said she had made a “catastrophic mistake” and “didn’t have the skillset” to be Prime Minister. Moreover, he said, she had run No 10 “as a fiefdom” that froze out Cabinet members. \n\nKatie Perrior, Mrs May’s former director of communications at No 10, said it would be “incredibly difficult” for her ex-boss to stay as Conservative leader. “There are a lot of bruised people out there this morning,” she said. \n\nAn executive member of the 1922 Committee, which represents Tory MPs, said Mrs May could stay but at a price. The MP said: “Nick Timothy has to go for his role in the manifesto. It was the worst I have fought on for 25 years. Instead of dollops of cream it was laced with arsenic.”\n\nNigel Evans, joint-secretary of the 1922 Committee, said manifesto hits on elderly voters had been toxic. “We derailed our own campaign,” he said. “We managed to steer the liner straight on to an iceberg called social care, the triple lock and winter weather payments.”\n\nCampaign consultant Lynton Crosby was said to be blaming Mr Timothy for the manifesto, when a so-called dementia tax led to a U-turn within days.\n\nThe Tories lost eight frontbenchers including Cabinet Office minister Ben Gummer, the official author of the manifesto. Home Secretary Amber Rudd held her seat with a 346 majority. Lib Dem ex-deputy prime minister Nick Clegg was ousted from Sheffield Hallam. There are more women MPs than ever, with over 200 for the first time. \n\nAfter 649 constituency results out of 650, the turnout was 32,159,240, or 68.74 per cent, up 2.63 per cent."],[8,"How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform","The Egyptians used to believe that literacy was divine, a gift from baboon-faced Thoth, the god of knowledge.\n\nScholars no longer embrace that theory, but why ancient civilisations developed writing was a mystery for a long time. Was it for religious or artistic reasons? To communicate with distant armies?\n\nThe mystery deepened in 1929, when a German archaeologist named Julius Jordan unearthed a vast library of clay tablets that were 5,000 years old.\n\nThey were far older than the samples of writing already discovered in China, Egypt and Mesoamerica, and were written in an abstract script that became known as \"cuneiform\".\n\nThe tablets came from Uruk, a Mesopotamian settlement on the banks of the Euphrates in what is now Iraq.\n\nUruk was small by today's standards - with only a few thousand inhabitants - but in its time was huge, one of the world's first true cities.\n\n\"He built the town wall of 'Uruk', city of sheepfolds,\" proclaims the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest works of literature. \"Look at its wall with its frieze like bronze! Gaze at its bastions, which none can equal!\"\n\nThis great city had produced writing that no modern scholar could decipher. What did it say?\n\n50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world.\n\nUruk posed another puzzle for archaeologists - although initially it seemed unrelated.\n\nThe ruins of Uruk and other Mesopotamian cities were littered with little clay objects - conical, spherical and cylindrical. One archaeologist quipped they looked like suppositories.\n\nJulius Jordan was a little more perceptive. They were shaped, he wrote in his journal, \"like the commodities of daily life - jars, loaves, and animals\", although they were stylised and standardised.\n\nBut what were they for? Nobody could work it out.\n\nNobody, that is, until the French archaeologist Denise Schmandt-Besserat.\n\nIn the 1970s, she catalogued similar pieces found across the region, from Turkey to Pakistan, some of which were 9,000 years old.\n\nSchmandt-Besserat believed the tokens had a simple purpose: correspondence counting. The tokens that were shaped like loaves could be used to count loaves. The ones shaped like jars could be used to count jars.\n\nCorrespondence counting is easy: you don't need to know how to count, you just need to look at two quantities and verify that they are the same.\n\nThe technique is older even than Uruk.\n\nThe 20,000-year-old Ishango Bone - found near one of the sources of the Nile in the Democratic Republic of Congo - seems to use matched tally marks on the thigh bone of a baboon for correspondence counting.\n\nBut the Uruk tokens took things further: they were used to keep track of counting lots of different quantities, and could be used both to add and to subtract.\n\nRemember, Uruk was a great city. There was a priesthood, there were craftsmen. Food was gathered from the surrounding countryside.\n\nAn urban economy requires trading, and planning, and taxation too. Picture the world's first accountants, sitting at the door of the temple storehouse, using the little loaf tokens to count as the sacks of grain arrive and leave.\n\nDenise Schmandt-Besserat pointed out something else revolutionary. The abstract marks on the cuneiform tablets matched the tokens. Everyone else had missed the resemblance because the writing didn't seem to be a picture of anything.\n\nBut Schmandt-Besserat realised what had happened. The tablets had been used to record the back-and-forth of the tokens, which themselves were recording the back-and-forth of the sheep, the grain, and the jars of honey.\n\nIn fact, it may be that the first such tablets were impressions of the tokens themselves, pressing the hard clay baubles into the soft clay tablet.\n\nThen those ancient accountants realised it might be simpler to make the marks with a stylus. So cuneiform writing was a stylised picture of an impression of a token representing a commodity. No wonder nobody had made the connection before Schmandt-Besserat.\n\nAnd so she solved both problems at once. Those clay tablets, adorned with the world's first abstract writing? They weren't being used for poetry, or to send messages to far-off lands. They were used to create the world's first accounts.\n\nThe world's first written contracts, too - since there is just a small leap between a record of what has been paid, and a record of a future obligation to pay.\n\nThe combination of the tokens and the clay cuneiform writing led to a brilliant verification device: a hollow clay ball called a bulla. On the outside of the bulla, the parties to a contract could write down the details of the obligation - including the resources that were to be paid.\n\nOn the inside of the bulla would be the tokens representing the deal. The writing on the outside and the tokens inside the clay ball verified each other.\n\nWe don't know who the parties to such agreements might have been - whether they were religious tithes to the temple, taxes, or private debts, is unclear. But such records were the purchase orders and the receipts that made life in a complex city society possible.\n\nThis is a big deal.\n\nMost financial transactions are based on explicit written contracts. Insurance, a bank account, a government bond, a corporate share, a mortgage agreement - they're all written contracts - and the bullas of Mesopotamia are the very first archaeological evidence that written contracts existed.\n\nUruk's accountants provided us with another innovation, too.\n\nAt first, the system for recording five sheep would simply require five separate sheep impressions. But that was cumbersome. A superior system involved using an abstract symbol for different numbers - five strokes for five, a circle for 10, two circles and three strokes for 23.\n\nThe numbers were always used to refer to a quantity of something: there was no \"10\" - only \"10 sheep\". But the numerical system was powerful enough to express large quantities - hundreds, and thousands.\n\nOne demand for war reparations, 4,400 years old, is for 4.5 trillion litres of barley grain, or 8.64 million \"guru\".\n\nIt was an unpayable bill - 600 times the US's annual production of barley today. But it was an impressively big number. It was also the world's first written evidence of compound interest.\n\nIn all it is quite a set of achievements.\n\nThe citizens of Uruk faced a huge problem, a problem that is fundamental to any modern economy - how to deal with a web of obligations and long-range plans between people who did not know each other well, who might perhaps never even meet.\n\nSolving that problem meant producing a string of brilliant innovations: not only the first accounts and the first contracts, but the first mathematics and even the first writing.\n\nWriting wasn't a gift from the gods. It was a tool that was developed for a very clear reason: to run an economy."],[8,"Another deadly consequence of climate change: The spread of dangerous diseases","With President Trump’s decision on U.S. participation in the Paris climate accords expected in the next few days, there has been widespread discussion of the many consequences that climate change will have for us and our children, including extreme weather events, displacement of people, submergence of lands and devastation to our oceans. But one of the most potentially deadly effects has been far less discussed: an increase in the spread of dangerous epidemics and the risk of a global pandemic.\n\nAs the Earth’s climate alters, we are seeing changes in where and how humans live; these changes increase the risk that deadly diseases will emerge and spread more rapidly. While the interactions between climate change and disease are hard to predict with certainty, the scientific linkages are unmistakable. If we fail to integrate planning for the impact of climate change with planning for the prevention and management of pandemic disease, the consequences will be deadly.\n\nThe link between climate and disease is most often identified through the spread of disease vectors such as mosquitoes. As areas warm, habitats for insects — mosquitoes and deer ticks, for example — expand, exposing new populations to new disease threats. As Maryn McKenna recently explained in the New York Times Magazine, the approximately one degree Celsius increase in average temperatures the planet has experienced is “changing the numbers and distribution of the insect intermediaries that carry diseases to people.” Most immediately, we could see a larger number of people at risk in the United States from Zika this summer as the Aedes aegypti mosquito moves farther north, complicating the already challenging efforts to constrain the disease.\n\nBut a second, and less appreciated, interaction between climate change and epidemics occurs when humans and animals are forced to compete for dwindling habitat and resources. The scenario behind Ebola’s rise and global threat in 2014 illustrates this point. Climate change destroys habitats and stresses animal populations such as the bats of West Africa, forcing them to hunt for food nearer to humans. Humans, likewise pressed by climate impacts, encroach more closely on animal habitats. While we cannot know that climate change was the cause of the specific interaction between bats and humans that is believed to have launched the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, we will see more of these interactions in the future, and more epidemics as a result.\n\nEbola demonstrates that even localized dislocation of people and animals can create global risk. Climate change is a threat multiplier for much broader dislocation — accelerating the complex factors that drive people from their homes. While in some cases climate-affected dislocation will be “planned” — as with the climate refugees in Louisiana or on remote Pacific islands such as Kiribati — more often it will occur in large, unplanned migrations that amplify regional instability and crisis. This dynamic can also drive migrations from rural into urban areas, as occurred in Syria, where the 2006-2010 drought killed off 80 percent of the country’s livestock and helped drive more than 1.5 million people into stressed urban centers. The U.S. intelligence community’s bottom-line assessment of the risk is plain: “Over 20 years, the net effects of climate change on the patterns of global human movement and statelessness could be dramatic, perhaps unprecedented.”\n\nWe saw Ebola breach the rural-to-urban interface in West Africa; the outcome and extent of the current outbreak of Ebola in Congo remains to be seen. As climate change accelerates the movement of people, the risks of disease formation and transmission will multiply.\n\nWhile these risks are acute, they can be addressed. The use of data to build models of future disease incidence based on climatic trends can create an early-warning system. In recent years, the State Department stepped up its work with developing countries to use high-quality data to project climate risks, including from the spread of disease. International efforts such as the IRI/WHO early-warning system for climate-related diseases also provide models. To be maximally effective, these measures should be integrated into the whole-of-government planning for pandemic prevention and response. This work requires resources and global coordination, but it can deliver results.\n\nUnfortunately, the Trump administration is engaged in a form of double denial — slashing funding for the science to fight disease and climate change. Trump’s newly released budget would set back medical research through a massive, 19 percent ($5.8 billion) cut to the National Institutes of Health and would undermine federal capacity to work with communities on strategies to keep them safe through a 17 percent ($1.3 billion) cut to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the same time, it would effectively eliminate our government’s capacity to collect and analyze data on climate change and end all of the State Department’s efforts to get other countries to prepare for threats before they spill over their borders to ours.\n\nThe administration’s response seems to be that, by retreating, we can simply ignore these global challenges. How else can one explain a budget strategy that funds the construction of a border wall while cutting roughly $7 billion from the NIH and CDC?\n\nBoth climate change and disease are intrinsically global threats. They cannot be wished away by ignoring science or building walls. There is no strategy to close our borders or shut our doors that can keep temperatures from rising, disease vectors from spreading and humans from interacting in ways that create new vulnerabilities.\n\nThe only way to keep our country safe is to better understand the science behind climate change and disease, better prepare our communities and public-health officials to respond, and better arm other countries to anticipate the spread of these threats before they spill over national borders. Denying this reality will have deadly consequences."],[8,"Bernie Sanders Says Democrats Need To Do More Than Just Criticize Trump","During a speech to thousands of activists in Chicago this weekend, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called the Democratic Party’s political strategy “an absolute failure” and he urged party leaders to begin promoting a more forceful populist economic agenda. \n\nAfter the speech, Sanders spoke with International Business Times’ David Sirota about his renewed push for single-payer health care, his fight against Donald Trump's administration — and his battle with some Democrats who say the party should not move dramatically leftward. Sanders talked about whether it is time for a third party in America, and what his 2016 campaign taught him about communities of color. He also discussed whether or not the Trump-Russia controversy is siphoning attention from issues like economic inequality, healthcare and climate change. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of the discussion. (Disclaimer: Sirota briefly worked for Sanders 18 years ago.)\n\nSirota: You said that the Democratic Party's political strategy has been an “absolute failure,” and that it must decide which side it’s on. Why are you still operating within the party? Why don't you start your own party?\n\nSanders: Look, these are enormously dangerous times for this country. We are drifting toward authoritarianism, we are seeing 43 million people living in poverty, we’re seeing this nation move toward an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control our economy and our political life. You know, I have probably more experience than almost anybody in terms of third party politics. I’m the longest serving independent in the history of the United States Congress, I’ve defeated Democrats, I’ve defeated Republicans. All that I’m saying is, if you look at history it is not so easy to form a third party, to run candidates in 50 states in this country to get the kind of media attention that you need. It ain't easy and the time is late.\n\nAt this moment what my view is, is that there are many parts of this country where progressives get involved in a very active way. They can become the leadership of the Democratic Party. We showed that within the Democratic primary — taking on the entire establishment. We did quite well. So I think there is potential to make real progress within the Democratic Party and that's what I propose to do.\n\nSirota: You were criticized recently for supporting a Democratic candidate who has at times voted against abortion rights. In Georgia now, Democratic congressional candidate Jon Ossoff says he opposed to raising taxes on the wealthy and opposes single payer healthcare. You and many progressives have argued for the opposite. Is the Democratic Party a big-tent party, big enough to include both sets of those positions?\n\nSanders: I think in terms of the most important issues facing this country, which would include finally demanding the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes, moving toward universal healthcare, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, etc, etc, a vast majority of the people support those ideas. Now, there are more conservative districts, and I can understand somebody who's more conservative running for office. That's fine. There are parts of this country where people are split, where honest people are not, you know, I've a 100 percent lifetime pro-choice voting record, but there are people who disagree with me. I supported the candidate who's running for mayor of Omaha who I thought put together a very strong progressive coalition; I disagree with him on one issue. So, in general, the momentum is with us toward making the Democratic Party far more progressive. It will not have progressive candidates, or strong progressive candidates in every single district on every single issue, and I think we have to understand that.\n\nSirota: Hillary Clinton during the campaign said single-payer healthcare, “will never, ever happen.” How much opposition to that idea do you see within the Democratic Party?\n\nSanders: There'll be a lot of opposition to it. I think again, the momentum is with us, and I'll tell you why, because while most people, including myself, would agree that Obamacare has done good things, we added 20 million more people to the ranks of the uninsured, did away with this nonsense about pre-existing conditions, etc, etc. I think people also see the limitations of the Affordable Care Act and are asking why it is that we can't join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Why it is we spend probably two-and-a-half times per person than they do in the United Kingdom. Why? And they guarantee healthcare to all people. The momentum is with us. The opposition from insurance companies, drug companies, and conservatives within the Democratic Party will be enormous. Transforming our healthcare system, which is 17 percent of our GDP, will be a monumental struggle, but I think time is on our side.\n\nSirota: You participated in civil rights protests and you supported pro-equality legislation throughout your career, and yet you were attacked during the campaign at times by some who said you did not care about communities of color. How did that feel?\n\nSanders: That was personally very painful. It was very painful, but what I am proud of is that we ended up winning within the African-American community, within the Latino community, by the way. Very, very strong support in virtually every state in this country. We won the youth vote, people under 40 in the African-American community. So I think it was also a generational issue. Older African-Americans felt comfortable with the Clintons, they knew them, they liked them. But I think we have made real inroads among young people.\n\nSirota: What did you learn about communities of color that perhaps you hadn't known before the campaign?\n\nSanders: That's a very fair question, and what I learned is that there are African-American communities around this country where people feel extremely intimidated by the local police, and it's not just the examples, the horrible examples of police murders that took place with people getting shot in the back. It is just the fear of sending your kid out to the grocery store and what might happen to him or to her. That degree of intimidation, of oppression in inner cities is something I was not as aware of at the beginning of the campaign as I certainly was by the end.\n\nSirota: You described yourself in the past as a democratic socialist and much of your agenda and message is a critique of capitalism. Do you believe fundamentally that capitalism itself is a problem?\n\nSanders:  Well, what I believe is that, I believe two things. Number one, I believe that human beings, because they are human beings, are entitled to certain rights. You're a human being, you're entitled to healthcare, whether you're rich or you're poor. You and your kids are entitled to quality education, whether you're rich or you're poor. You're entitled to decent housing. So the question of rights is to me very, very important.\n\nSecond of all, what capitalism does, it says what the good life is about, what you have got to strive for is to make as much money as you possibly can. That's the ulterior. We judge you as a person, not whether you're a great teacher, whether you're a great childcare worker, whether you're a physician saving lives every day, you are a multi-billionaire. And by the way, increasingly, we don't even care how you make your money. So somebody like Donald Trump becomes the example of what we are striving for. Here's a guy who has been involved in 3,500 lawsuits in his business life. He lies all the time, but he is a multi-billionaire and this is the kind of mentality and character that we should be approving of. I don't accept that. I think that being a good human being doesn't mean stepping on other people in order to get rich. It means sharing your life with other people, understanding the importance of community. That's another aspect of capitalism that concerns me.\n\nSirota: Have you ever met Donald Trump? \n\nSanders: I've been in the same room with Trump, I've been invited to meet with him in the White House, but my nervousness about Trump is such that I certainly do not want to be used as a photo opportunity. So if Trump, for example — Trump has talked about infrastructure, Trump has talked about the high cost of prescription drugs. If he wants to sit down and negotiate specific legislation I would be happy to do that, but I'm not going to be there just to get a photo opportunity and have it used for his advantage.\n\nSirota: Are you at all optimistic that there are some issues and policies on which you can work constructively with Trump?\n\nSanders: Originally I thought there were two places. One was infrastructure. He talked about a trillion dollar infrastructure program, which is exactly what I raised during the campaign. He talked about the high cost of prescription drugs and his willingness to take on the pharmaceutical industry. Unfortunately, as I think most Americans now know, Trump lies a whole lot of the time and a lot of his campaign was just a lot of lies. The infrastructure plan that he brought forth was a disaster. Instead of a trillion it was 200 billion, and essentially he wants cities and towns all over this country to sell off their water systems, their roads, their bridges, to Wall Street and to the private sector to raise the money to do that. That’s just a disastrous, absurd plan. We will see the nature of the negotiations that take place. So, can we do something on infrastructure? I certainly hope so, because we can create up to 15 million jobs, and we certainly need to rebuild our roads, bridges, and water systems.\n\nSecond of all, in terms of prescription drugs, he talked a good game. We have introduced legislation that would allow Americans to purchase much lower cost medicine from Canada, from other countries. We will see if he comes on board. I suspect he probably won’t if all of that was just talk and lies.\n\nSirota: Some have argued that the Russia-Trump controversy has gotten too much attention, and that it is distracting from other important economic issues.\n\nSanders: I understand the argument, and I understand the absolute need to focus on issues like raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks and hour, pay equity for women, rebuilding our infrastructure, moving toward a single payer healthcare system. No debate we have got to do that, and we cannot succeed in winning the issues or winning elections simply by criticizing Trump. I accept that, and I am one of the leaders in trying to do that.\n\n On the other hand, you can not ignore the fact that a major nation on this earth, Russia, and their leader, Vladimir Putin, attempted to undermine the American democratic process by cyber attacks in the United States at our election, and doing that in France, and doing that in other countries around the world. That is unacceptable and that has to be dealt with. You can not ignore the fact that right now there is an investigation to look at whether or not Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in that effort, and whether or not Trump obstructed justice by firing James Comey as FBI director. So the difficulty is, there are an enormous number of important issues. We got to deal with them all, but it’s not either-or. We’ve got to deal with them all.\n\nSirota: The Democratic Party leadership has lost the White House, Congress, 1,000 state legislative seats and many governorships. Why is the party still run by the same group of people who delivered that electoral record?\n\nSanders: Because there are people who, as I often say, would rather have first class seats going down with the Titanic, rather than change the course of the ship. There are people who have spent their entire lives in the Democratic Party, there are people who've invested a whole lot of money into the Democratic Party, they think the Democratic Party belongs to them. You know, they own a home, they may own a boat, they may own the Democratic Party. I mean, that's just the way people are, and I think there is reluctance on some, not all by the way — I mean, I ran around this country and I met with the Democratic Party leaders in almost every state in the country. Some of them made it very clear they did not want to open the door to working people, they did not want to open to door to young people. They wanted to maintain the status quo. On the other hand, I will tell you, there are party leaders around the country that said, “You know what, Bernie? There’s a lot of young people out there who want to get involved. We think that’s a great idea, and we want them involved.”\n\nSirota: After decades in public office, what do you think remains the least well-understood aspect of American politics?\n\nSirota: The least understood, or the least discussed, has to do of course with class issues, because who’s going to talk about it? NBC is not going to talk about it, CBS, The New York Times are not going to talk about it. The reality of American society today not talked about in Congress or the corporate media is that we are moving toward an oligarchy. Our political system is entirely corrupt as a result of Citizens United. Who would have believed 20, 30 years ago that a handful — a handful! — half-a-dozen billionaires could spend many, many, many hundreds of millions of dollars on elections from school board to the White House and buy elections? This is just an outrage. It’s why we need not only to overturn Citizens United, but move to public funding of elections.\n\nSecond of all, in terms of income and wealth inequality, the idea that the top one-tenth of 1 percent now makes almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent; the top 1 percent earns 52 percent of all new income; it is incredible. It is absolutely incredible, but it is easier for the media to say, “Let's talk about racism. Let's talk about sexism. Let's talk about homophobia,” than talk about the movement of this country into oligarchy. So, that is an area that does not get ... You know, the oligarchs, needless to say, are not enthusiastic about talking about oligarchy in America."],[8,"Devastating blow for hundreds of dementia sufferers as Alzheimer's Society quits Liverpool","Hundreds of dementia sufferers face losing vital care services after the Alzheimer’s Society confirmed they were pulling out of Liverpool.\n\nThe charity, which helps 650 people in the city suffering with the debilitating disease, is axeing its support network after their funding was cut by the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).\n\nServices due to be culled include dementia support, singing for the brain services, the dementia café and CrISP - the carers information support programme - among others.\n\nDementia is caused when the brain is damaged by diseases, such as Alzheimer’s or a series of strokes.

She didn’t expect anything else from him, she finds him absolutely unpredictable. Her analysis of his character is that he is no politician. For politics in a multi-polar world means balancing interests, finding compromises, face-saving solutions for everyone. Trump is incapable of that since he only feels strong when everyone else loses. Given that, shared policies are as good as impossible. All attempts at changing something about this anti-politics through the rational people surrounding the president are largely hopeless. The rule is, the more sensible, the less the influence. Even Trump’s relatively accessible and open-minded daughter, Ivanka ultimately acts not to correct and restrain her father, but as his accomplice.\n\nMany consider Donald Trump to be an aberration of an intrinsically sensible American foreign policy and also imply the chancellor wants a return to \"normality\" as soon as possible. In fact, the chancellor apparently isn’t assuming that Donald Trump will step down any time in the foreseeable future or could be removed by an impeachment process. She also doesn’t judge Vice President Mike Pence to be a reliable partner. The man is a creationist, meaning he disputes the theory of evolution, which permits certain conclusions about how rational his world view is. Moreover, he embodies a superiority-inspired foreign policy that falls far behind Barack Obama. In any case, the chancellor has an extremely dim view of the state of American democracy. The Democrats are far from recovering from their defeat, while the Republicans are dominated by all kinds of extreme sects.\n\nThe day after her speech, the chancellor had it made known that of course, she stands by the trans-Atlantic alliance. With that, she not only wanted to muffle the noise her comment on Sunday had made, she also meant it that way. After all, it isn’t in German interests that Americans isolate themselves and act against the EU and Germany in all the key areas of global politics. She certainly wasn’t looking to make a demonstrative gesture of German emancipation. After all, it isn’t Germany that is saying goodbye to the US but the other way around. The US is withdrawing from the old continent and out of its neighborhood conflicts. And hasn’t been doing so just since Donald Trump has been president. Power and interest here had already diminished greatly under President Obama. (Actually, it is certainly difficult to explain why, for instance, the USA should spend huge amounts to defend a continent, which, as the EU, has an almost equally large gross domestic product at its disposal, meaning it could equally well help itself.)\n\nIf Merkel didn’t want to end the trans-Atlantic relationship, what’s all the fuss about anyway? She, herself, showed no signs at all of being surprised by the worldwide reaction. She was aware of the message within the message. That has to do with an unspoken premise of this special relationship. Trans-Atlantic always meant the democratically-reliable USA is watching over the Europeans, who tend to be unreliable, that it is allowed to dominate them, indeed must. This right to leadership and watching over Europe derives from the World Wars and the Cold War, during which the Americans protected the Europeans from the Soviets’ expansionist designs by their presence. Amazingly enough, this asymmetrical relationship had survived up until last Sunday, in other words, over a quarter of a century longer than the Soviet Union.\n\nBy now declaring the US to be an unreliable partner, Merkel isn’t terminating the trans-Atlantic relationship as such, but is certainly ending the paternalistic bias contained in it. The German chancellor assumes the right to publicly give an opinion about the condition of the US. It may be that she will revise her judgment in a couple years, if the US returns to its senses. But she will no longer surrender the right to judge (nor will her successors). The provocation is less in the judgment than in the judging. By all appearances, Ms. Merkel sees the US’ claim to leadership as having been forfeited. That would explain the big waves her words made.\n\nIt was a long road for this woman to reach Trudering. Merkel was once again reminded during her recent encounter with Barack Obama that she had yearned to go to the US, the land of her dreams, even back when she was still living behind the Wall. And also as a politician, she remained true to the unequal friendship to the US, so much so, in fact, that it almost cost her her career. For when Schröder was formulating his \"no,\" the CDU chairman at the time had it made known from the US that the chancellor wasn’t speaking for all Germans. Close, she was darn close to saying \"yes\" to the Iraq War. It wasn’t until she herself was chancellor that a learning process began that more and more often led to her own discretely presented and skillfully-packaged \"nos.\" They spanned the Libyan intervention, Georgia’s and Ukraine’s NATO membership or the many arms shipments to Kiev vehemently demanded in Washington.\n\nIt was on these occasions that she came to know the imperious side of American foreign policy, without being impressed by it. At least her pro-American background now prevents Merkel from thinking naively about her neighbor to the East to compensate for the unreliability of her partner overseas. Her speech from last Sunday has also changed nothing in her attitude toward Putin. On the contrary, only because she has a firm stance toward the East is Merkel able to allow herself to direct criticism of the West.\n\nOne thing can be said for sure: without Emmanuel Macron’s victory in France, there would have never been that speech in the beer tent. Only because the authoritarian forces in Europe have been stopped for the time being, is the German chancellor able to count on the strength of Europe. Nevertheless, this mortgage is wildly expensive, because the EU cannot quickly fill the vacuum left behind by the unreliable Americans, who themselves are becoming weaker. Most of all, this leaves a dangerous gap in security policy for now. With his refusal to reaffirm the NATO agreement’s mutual defense commitment, Trump undermined the alliance’s credibility – and the Europeans are a long way off from being able to forego US military should Putin be of a mind for an adventure. And while the USA has plunged the Middle East into chaos, the Europeans are far from being able to establish a new order there. Merkel knows the EU can’t do everything without the US – though there’s a lot it can do.\n\nThe chancellor has evidently decided to also act in opposition to the US if needs be. She scored one spectacular initial success at the summit, where she managed to create a constellation of 6 against 1. She even pulled Japan and Canada over to her side, the European side. That is now most likely her motto: better not to make decisions with everybody than make no decisions; better isolate the US than suspend common sense. She’ll act along those lines at the upcoming G20 summit. Either Donald Trump changes his policies, or at least his tactics, or it could turn out to be 19 against 1. Even better, 18 to 2, the US and Saudi Arabia. The two can dance the saber dance by themselves.\n\nTranslated by David Andersen"],[8,"Tony Robbins: How to Suffer Less (and Invest Intelligently)","Whether you’d like to avoid unnecessary emotional suffering or unnecessary financial suffering, this post has something for you.\n\nIn my second podcast with Tony Robbins, he said that all fear comes from three triggers: loss, less, and never.

An undirected mind operates naturally in survival mode, constantly identifying and magnifying these potential threats to our well-being. The result: a life filled with stress and anxiety.\n\nMost people live this way since it’s the path of least resistance. They make unconscious decisions, based on habit and conditioning, and are at the mercy of their own minds. They assume that it’s just an inevitable part of life to get frustrated, stressed, sad, and angry—in other words, to live in a suffering state. But I’m happy to tell you there’s another path: one that involves directing your thoughts so that your mind does your bidding, not the other way around.\n\nNow, before we go any further, let’s just clarify the difference between these two emotional and mental states:\n\nA Beautiful State\n\nWhen you feel love, joy, gratitude, awe, playfulness, ease, creativity, drive, caring, growth, curiosity, or appreciation, you’re in a beautiful state. In this state, you know exactly what to do, and you do the right thing. In this state, your spirit and your heart are alive, and the best of you comes out. Nothing feels like a problem, and everything flows. You feel no fear or frustration. You’re in harmony with your true essence.\n\nA Suffering State\n\nWhen you’re feeling stressed out, worried, frustrated, angry, depressed, irritable, overwhelmed, resentful, or fearful, you’re in a suffering state. We’ve all experienced these and countless other “negative” emotions, even if we’re not always keen to admit it! Most achievers much prefer to think they’re stressed than fearful. But “stress” is just the achiever word for fear. If I follow the trail of your stress, it’ll take me to your deepest fear.\n\nEveryone has his or her own flavor of suffering. So here’s my question for you: What’s your favorite flavor of suffering? Which energy-sapping emotion do you indulge in most? Is it sadness? Frustration? Anger? Despair? Self-pity? Jealousy? Worry? The specific details don’t really matter because they’re all states of suffering. And all this suffering is really just the result of an undirected mind that’s hell-bent on looking for problems.\n\nThink for a moment about a recent situation that caused you pain or suffering—a time when you felt frustrated or angry or worried or overwhelmed. Whenever you feel emotions like these, your sense of suffering is caused by your undirected mind engaging in one or more of three particular patterns of perception.\n\nConsciously or unconsciously, you’re focused on at least one of three triggers for suffering:\n\nWhen you focus on loss, you become convinced that a particular problem has caused or will cause you to lose something you value. For example, you have a conflict with your spouse, and it leaves you feeling that you’ve lost love or respect. But it doesn’t have to be something someone else did—or failed to do—that caused you to perceive the sense of loss. This sense of loss can also be triggered by something you did or failed to do. For example, you procrastinated, and now you’ve lost a business opportunity. Whenever we believe in the illusion of loss, we suffer.\n\nWhen you focus on the idea that you have less or will have less, you will suffer. For example, you might become convinced that because a situation has occurred or a person has acted a certain way, you will have less joy, less money, less success, or some other painful consequence. Once again, less can be triggered by what you, or others, do or fail to do.\n\nWhen you focus on the idea or become consumed by a belief that you’ll never have something you value—such as love, joy, respect, wealth, opportunity—you’re doomed to suffer, you’ll never be happy, you’ll never become the person you want to be. This pattern of perception is a surefire route to pain. Remember: the mind is always trying to trick us into a survival mindset! So never say never! For example, because of an illness, an injury, or because of something your brother did or said, you might believe that you’ll never get over it.\n\nThese three patterns of focus account for most, if not all, of our suffering. And you know what’s crazy? It doesn’t even matter if the problem is real or not! Whatever we focus on, we feel—regardless of what actually happened. Have you ever had the experience of thinking that a friend did something horrible to you? You became tremendously angry and upset, only to discover that you were dead wrong and that the person didn’t deserve all that blame! In the midst of your suffering, when all those negative emotions were swirling inside your head, the reality didn’t matter. Your focus created your feelings, and your feelings created your experience. Notice too that most, if not all, of our suffering is caused by focusing or obsessing about ourselves and what we might lose, have less of, or never have.\n\nBut here’s the good news: once you’re aware of these patterns of focus, you can systematically change them, thereby freeing yourself from these habits of suffering. It all starts with the realization that this involves a conscious choice. Either you master your mind or it masters you. The secret of living an extraordinary life is to take control of the mind since this alone will determine whether you live in a suffering state or a beautiful state.\n\nOur lives are shaped not by our conditions, but by our decisions. If you look back on the last 5 or 10 years I’d be willing to bet that you can recall a decision or two that has truly changed your life. Maybe it was a decision about where to go to school, what profession to pursue, or who you chose to love or marry. Looking back on it now, can you see how radically different your life would be today if you had made a different decision? These and so many other decisions determine the direction of your life and can change your destiny.\n\nSo what’s the biggest decision you can make in your life right now? In the past, I would have told you that what matters most is who you decide to spend your time with, who you decide to love. After all, the company you keep will powerfully shape who you become.\n\nBut over the last two years, my thinking has evolved. What I’ve come to realize is that the single most important decision in life is this: Are you committed to being happy, no matter what happens to you?\n\nTo put this another way, will you commit to enjoying life not only when everything goes your way but also when everything goes against you, when injustice happens, when someone screws you over, when you lose something or someone you love, or when nobody seems to understand or appreciate you? Unless we make this definitive decision to stop suffering and live in a beautiful state, our survival minds will create suffering whenever our desires, expectations, or preferences are not met. What a waste of so much of our lives!\n\nThis is a decision that can change everything in your life, starting today. But it’s not enough just to say that you’d like to make this change or that your preference is to be happy no matter what. You have to own this decision, do whatever it takes to make it happen, and cut off any possibility of turning back. If you want to take the island, you have to burn the boats. You have to decide that you’re 100% responsible for your state of mind and for your experience of this life.\n\nWhat it really comes down to is drawing a line in the sand today and declaring, “I’m done with suffering. I’m going to live every day to the fullest and find juice in every moment, including the ones I don’t like, BECAUSE LIFE IS JUST TOO SHORT TO SUFFER.”\n\n[TIM: The below is a small sample of my notes from Tony’s newest book, Unshakeable: Your Financial Freedom Playbook.  I originally captured these notes in Evernote.]\n\nPaul Tudor Jones questions:\n\n“Is this truly the hard trade (something others can’t easily replicate)? Does it really have asymmetric risk/reward? Is it a five-to-one or a three-to-one? What’s the entry point? Where are your stops?”\n\nPg. 36, -38% year — TF: How long to recover to baseline if you entered that year?\n\nThe stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient—WARREN BUFFETT\n\n****TF:  If corrections of 10% come once per year, couldn’t I hold cash and simply have that trigger purchases 1x per year?  Or wait for 20% “bear market” drop, then invest?\n\n“Buffett did just that in late 2008, investing in fallen giants such as Goldman Sachs and General Electric, which were selling at once-in-a-lifetime valuations. Better still, he structured these investments in ways that reduced his risk even further. For example, he invested $5 billion in a special class of “preferred” shares of Goldman Sachs, which guaranteed him a dividend of 10% a year while he waited for the stock price to recover.”\n\nAnd/Or: Go with index fund\n\nShowmethefees.com for 401(k) plan fees, etc. http://getasecondopinion.com/ for Tony’s Creative Planning\n\nIn the interests of cutting through the confusion, I’m going to make this as simple and straightforward as possible. In reality, all financial advisors fall into just one of three categories. What you really need to know is whether your advisor is:\n\nNow let’s break this down in more detail so you know exactly what you’re dealing with.\n\nQuestion to ask: Do you act as a “fiduciary” [what you want] or a “broker” or both?\n\nWealth manager needs to understand taxes, insurance, etc.\n\n1. Are You a Registered Investment Advisor? If the answer is no, this advisor is a broker. Smile sweetly and say good-bye. If the answer is yes, he or she is required by law to be a fiduciary. But you still need to figure out if this fiduciary is wearing one hat or two.\n\n2. Are You (or Your Firm) Affiliated with a Broker-Dealer? If the answer is yes, you’re dealing with someone who can act as a broker and usually has an incentive to steer you to specific investments. One easy way to figure this out is to glance at the bottom of the advisor’s website or business card and see if there’s a sentence like this: “Securities offered through [advisor’s company name], member FINRA and SIPC.” This refers to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, respectively. If you see these words, it means he or she can act as a broker. If so, run! Run for your life!\n\n3. Does Your Firm Offer Proprietary Mutual Funds or Separately Managed Accounts? You want the answer to be an emphatic no. If the answer is yes, then watch your wallet like a hawk! It probably means they’re looking to generate additional revenues by steering you into these products that are highly profitable for them (but probably not for you).\n\n4. Do You or Your Firm Receive Any Third-Party Compensation for Recommending Particular Investments? This is the ultimate question you want answered. Why? Because you need to know that your advisor has no incentive to recommend products that will shower him or her with commissions, kickbacks, consulting fees, trips, or other goodies.\n\n5. What’s Your Philosophy When It Comes to Investing? This will help you to understand whether or not the advisor believes that he or she can beat the market by picking individual stocks or actively managed funds. Over time, that’s a losing game unless the person is a total superstar like Ray Dalio or Warren Buffett. Between you and me, they’re probably not.\n\n6. What Financial Planning Services Do You Offer Beyond Investment Strategy and Portfolio Management? Investment help may be all you need, depending on your stage of life. But as you grow older and/or you become more wealthy with various holdings to manage, things often become more complex financially: for example, you may need to deal with saving for a child’s college education, retirement planning, handling your vested stock options, or estate planning. Most advisors have limited capabilities once they venture beyond investing. As mentioned, most aren’t legally allowed to offer tax advice due to their broker status. Ideally, you want an advisor who can bring tools for tax efficiency in all aspects of your planning—from your investment planning to your business planning to your estate planning.\n\n7. Where Will My Money Be Held? A fiduciary advisor should always use a third-party custodian to hold your funds. For example, Fidelity, Schwab, and TD Ameritrade all have custodial arms that will keep your money in a secure environment. You then sign a limited power of attorney that gives the advisor the right to manage the money but never to make withdrawals. The good news about this arrangement is that if you ever want to fire your advisor, you don’t have to move your accounts. You can simply hire a new advisor who can take over managing your accounts without missing a beat. This custodial system also protects you from the danger of getting fleeced by a con man like Bernie Madoff.\n\nPAUL TUDOR JONES\n\n“The most important thing for me is that defense is 10 times more important than offense. . . . You have to be very focused on protecting the downside at all times.”\n\nPaul Tudor Jones, who uses a “five-to-one rule” to guide his investment decisions. “I’m risking one dollar in the expectation that I’ll make five,”\n\nRAY DALIO\n\n“What I realized is nobody knows and nobody ever will,” he says. “So I have to design an asset allocation that, even if I’m wrong, I’ll still be okay.”\n\nTONY TO ADVISORS\n\n“Don’t even bring me an investment idea unless you first tell me how we can protect against or minimize the downside.”\n\nCap gains of 20% versus 50% for income. “Believe me, all the billionaires I’ve ever met have one attribute in common: they and their advisors are really smart about taxes! They know that it’s not what they earn that counts. It’s what they keep. That’s real money, which they can spend, reinvest, or give away to improve the lives of others.”\n\nTony: “Of course, I don’t start with taxes. That would be a severe mistake. I always start with a focus on not losing money and on getting asymmetric risk/reward. Then, before making any investment, I make a point of asking, “How tax efficient is this going to be? And is there any way we could make it more tax efficient?””  Focus on after-tax returns and consider MLPs (p. 108).\n\nDIVERSIFICATION\n\nDavid Swensen:\n\nOf course, there are many different ways of diversifying. I discuss this in detail in Money: Master the Game, laying out the exact asset allocations recommended by Ray and other financial gurus, such as Jack Bogle and David Swensen. For example, David told me how individual investors can diversify by owning low-cost index funds that invest in six “really important” asset classes: US stocks, international stocks, emerging-market stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs), long-term US Treasuries, and Treasury Inflation-Protected securities (TIPS). He even shared the precise percentages that he would recommend allocating to each.\n\nRay Dalio:\n\nAim for 15 uncorrelated bets. “The holy grail of investing is to have 15 or more good—they don’t have to be great—uncorrelated bets.” In other words, everything comes down to owning an array of attractive assets that don’t move in tandem. That’s how you ensure survival and success. In his case, this includes investments in stocks, bonds, gold, commodities, real estate, and other alternatives. Ray emphasized that, by owning 15 uncorrelated investments, you can reduce your overall risk “by about 80%,” and “you’ll increase the return-to-risk ratio by a factor of five. So, your return is five times greater by reducing that risk.”\n\nSURVIVING/THRIVING IN BEAR MARKETS\n\nSir John Templeton’s famous remark: “The four most expensive words in investing are ‘This time it’s different.’\n\nTony co-author, Peter Mallouk: “Throughout the crash, we continued to invest heavily in the stock market on behalf of our clients. We took profits from strong asset classes such as bonds and invested the proceeds in weak asset classes such as US small-cap and large-cap stocks, international stocks, and emerging-market stocks. Instead of betting on individual companies, we bought index funds, which gave us instant diversification (at a low cost) across these massively undervalued markets”\n\nOn average, the market is down about one in every four years. You need to recognize this reality so you won’t be shocked when stocks tumble—and so you’ll avoid excessive risks. At the same time, it’s useful to recognize that the market has made money three out of every four years.\n\nOne reason why the best investors are so successful is that they override the natural tendency to be fearful during periods of market turmoil. Take Howard Marks. In the last 15 weeks of 2008, when financial markets were imploding, he told me that his team at Oaktree Capital Management invested about $500 million a week in distressed debt. That’s right! They invested half a billion dollars a week for 15 straight weeks during a time when many thought the end times had arrived! “It was obvious that everybody was suicidal,” Howard told me. “In general, that’s a good time to buy.”\n\nALTERNATIVE OPTIONS THAT CO-AUTHOR LIKES\n\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (REITS). I’m sure you know people who’ve done well by investing directly in residential property. But most of us can’t afford to diversify by owning a slew of houses or apartments. That’s one reason why I like to invest in publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nPrivate Equity Funds\n\nMaster Limited Partnerships. I’m a big fan of MLPs, which are publicly traded partnerships that typically invest in energy infrastructure, including oil and gas pipelines. What’s the appeal? As Tony mentioned in the last chapter, we sometimes recommend MLPs because they pay out a lot of income in a tax-efficient way. They don’t make sense for many investors (especially if you’re young or have your money in an IRA), but they can be great for an investor who is over 50 and has a large, taxable account.\n\np. 132 — Doesn’t like gold or hedgefunds\n\nREBALANCING\n\nBurton Malkiel: Unsuccessful investors tend to “buy the thing that’s gone up and sell the thing that’s gone down.” One benefit of rebalancing, says Malkiel, is that it “makes you do the opposite,” forcing you to buy assets when they’re out of favor and undervalued. You’ll profit richly when they recover.\n\n[Read more on investing from Tony here.]\n\nPosted on: February 20, 2017.\n\nPlease check outTribe of Mentors, my newest book, which shares short, tactical life advice from 100+ world-class performers.

The 57-year-old, from Erzincan in Turkey’s north-east, who has diabetes, had been marching for 15 days. He is one of thousands journeying by foot from Turkey’s capital to its largest city, many carrying banners that say “adalet” or “justice”.\n\n“We lost democracy in our country, and we want it back,” Aydur said, his shirt bearing the images of Nuriye Gülmen and Semih Özakça, two teachers who were jailed last month after more than 70 days on hunger strike over their arbitrarily dismissal in a government decree.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been dismissed or detained in a broad government crackdown in the aftermath of a coup attempt last July that left more than 250 people dead and 1,400 wounded. After declaring a state of emergency, the government’s purge went beyond the direct perpetrators of the coup to encompass a large swathe of civil society, the political opposition, academics, journalists and civil servants, squandering a rare moment of unity to solidify its hold on power.\n\nIn April, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan narrowly won a referendum that vastly expanded his powers, while the country’s judiciary has been reshaped in his image, with a quarter of the nation’s judges and prosecutors dismissed or jailed over alleged connections to Fethullah Gülen, an exiled preacher whose grassroots movement is widely believed in Turkey to have orchestrated the putsch.\n\nSenior opposition politicians have also been imprisoned. Earlier this month Enis Berberoğlu, a lawmaker with the People’s Republican party (CHP), was jailed for 25 years after leaking information to the press on Turkish intelligence’s transfer of weapons across the border to Syrian rebels.\n\nThat arrest sparked the Adalet march, a 280-mile (450-km) walk led by the CHP’s chairman, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, which set off from Ankara on 15 June. Organisers hope it will culminate in a large rally in Istanbul’s Maltepe neighbourhood on 9 July. It has drawn supporters along the way from across Turkish society despite the scorching summer heat, as it covers nine miles a day.\n\nThe protesters, dismissed as Gülen supporters by the government, have given a variety of reasons for their involvement: the country’s slide to authoritarianism, the authorities’ abuse of the state of emergency, the arrest of journalists and politicians, the crackdown on dissent, and even opposition to retirement laws.\n\n“Academics and teachers are being wrongfully dismissed, losing their jobs and food and they’re being deprived of their constitutional rights,” say Aydur. “The only thing left for them is to resist, and I wanted to give a voice to their resistance. We want independent courts, not one-man rule, and we want this justice for everyone including those on the opposite side.”\n\nThe atmosphere on Thursday was relaxed, belying the deep fissures and polarisation that run through a nation yet to come to terms with the coup attempt.\n\nA year ago hundreds of thousands of Turks gathered in Yenikapı square in Istanbul to celebrate victory over the coup plotters. But the euphoria quickly turned to alarm and then despair in the weeks and months that followed.\n\n“There is a reign of fear,” Kılıçdaroğlu said in an interview conducted during the march. “Journalists and citizens, the people, cannot speak. This is what we want to get rid of.”\n\n“When the 15 July coup happened every party was against it, but on 20 July there was a civil coup and its main plotter was Erdoğan,” he said. “The state of emergency gave him all the power, and with all the dismissals and investigations against thousands of academics and journalists and civil servants, there are ordinary citizens who cannot even talk to their lawyers. There is oppression against the opposition, and lawmakers are being arrested. This justice march is against this civil coup.”\n\nMany of Erdoğan’s religiously conservative supporters look upon the country’s secular opposition as elitist “White Turks” who used to dominate the upper echelons of the state and oppress the poor. In their eyes Erdoğan’s rise can be interpreted as a rebuke to the excesses of the elite.\n\nNamik Akbas, a 32-year-old from Amasya who joined the march, said the Erdoğan government was using religion to divide people.\n\n“Turkey has been ruled for a long time by this mentality of manipulating the public,” he said. “Adalet to me means unifying the country under secular, enlightened values. Secularism is not against religion.”\n\nFor Borga Budak, a 36-year-old CHP member from Ankara sporting a Che Guevara cap, the march is an attempt to give succour to the Turkish opposition’s cowed base.\n\n“The idea of this protest isn’t geographical,” Budak said. “It doesn’t stop in Istanbul. People need hope, and this walk gives them hope.”"],[8,"Police officer hugged grieving fiancé after his partner died in his arms in London Bridge attack","A police officer who tried to save the life of terror victim Christine Archibald as she lay dying on London Bridge has told of how he hugged her distraught fiancé as he learnt of her death.\n\nPc Liam Dolphin, 30, of City of London police, who was among a group of officers at a royal visit to the Met’s special operations room in south London, said he believed he and his colleague Special Constable Steven Morgan, 36, were the first officers on the scene.\n\nHe told of how he gave her cardiopulmonary resuscitation before  later hugged her distraught fiancé Tyler Ferguson after he learnt she had died inSaturday night's atrocity.\n\nThe heart breaking story emerged as the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall made a visit to thank the emergency services for their work during the London terror attack. \n\n“We thought we were turning up to a road accident,” said Mr Morgan. “But as we made our way to the south side of the bridge it became more severe with casualties. We were both doing first aid to the critically wounded.”\n\nBut as they started treating the wounded on the bridge “the naughty guys came back”, said Pc McLeod, 29, and the officers started fighting the terrorists. \n\n“Unfortunately all I had was my baton. That was actually the first time I have had to use it.”\n\nPc Dolphin said that when he arrived he found members of the public trying to help Ms Archibald, a 30-year-old Canadian charity worker who had been hit by the van on the bridge. “I was giving her CPR,” he said. “I left her when the medics came.”\n\nLater he came across her fiancé Tyler Ferguson among the walking wounded. “I found him on the other end of the bridge,” he said. “He was quite distressed. He told me she had been pronounced dead. I was just hugging him for a while. He had a bit of a difficult time.”\n\nHe said the memory of that night remained vivid. “It sticks with you,” he said. “It’s very difficult.”\n\nMr Morgan said he had not been back to his day job – as a marine specialist with Scottish Power working with offshore wind farms – since the attack. “I decided it would not be best to go straight back,” he said. “It is quite a different role, being a special constable and doing a day job.”\n\nOfficers from British Transport Police told how they went to the aid of a colleague who stabbed in the eye by the attackers. \n\n“We thought we were going to a fight,” said Pc Leon McLeod, 29. But as they started treating the wounded on the bridge, “the naughty guys came back” and the officers started fighting the terrorists, he said. \n\nIt was during that confrontation that a BTP officer was stabbed in the eye. By the time Pc Alfred Iswa, 51, got there the injured officer was lying on the ground. \n\n“I could see blood was coming out of his face, near the eye. But I couldn’t see where.”\n\nHe checked him for other injuries, and found another cut on the thigh.\n\nBy that time the attackers had fled, with Pc McLeod chasing after them. Pc Iswa, who stayed behind looking after the injured officer, said: “I was trying to help him and he pointed his baton towards the attacker and said, ‘Get him.’ Even when injured he was trying to fight.”\n\nPc McLeod knew the officer because they had joined the force at the same time. “It has become clear that is a fighter. He is a big guy. I was happy to have him by my side.”\n\nLater Pc McLeod said the severity of the incident never really sank in, “not even when the bullets started going.”\n\nThe time from the first call to the shooting of the terrorists “felt like forever”, he said. But when he checked the time, he realised it had only been eight minutes. “I thought, ‘Is that it?’”\n\nHe also questioned whether he had done all he could on the night. “Personally for me I question if I could do more, because it’s such a shit thing to be involved in.”\n\nTheir colleague Pc Lee Crook, 36 – whose birthday was on Saturday – was at Lewisham when the attack happened, and jumped on a train to London Bridge. “I wasn’t expecting it to stop at London Bridge. I was ready to pull the emergency alarm and jump off.”\n\nWith a member of the public Pcs Iswa and Crook loaded the injured officer on to an emergency stretcher and started walking him to Guy’s Hospital. But a passing police van flashed them and took him to King’s College Hospital instead. \n\nTwo City of London detectives also described how they arrived at the scene within two or three minutes of the call. DC Mark Alston, 35, said: “The whole thing was so surreal. It was just a strange situation to be in. There were people’s belongings all over the bridge. It was dead quiet there.”\n\nDc Tom Hayball, 33, said: “We had walking wounded being tended to by members of the public covered in blood. There was a real sense of community that came out of it.”"],[8,"RIPE NCC Statistics and Data — RIPE Labs","This article gives an insight into what the RIPE NCC's data shows us about Greece and its neighbouring coutries in terms of membership development, IPv6 deployment and RIPE Atlas coverage, among other factors.\n\nOn 26 May 2017, the Greek Network Operators' Group (GRNOG) holds its first full-day workshop in Athens. The NOG has grown steadily since it started in 2015, and over 100 people are expected to attend this meeting. The RIPE NCC will be attendance, and this article provides some background information on how we see developments in Greece and four countries surrounding it - Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).\n\nIn the table below, you can see geographic and demographic information for the countries we look at. Figures for area and population are from Wikipedia.\n\nPlease note that this article, unless otherwise noted, shows a snapshot of the situation as seen on 22 May 2017. However, in most cases we also provide a link to the most up-to-date information.\n\nIn Figure 1, you can see the growth of the number of Local Internet Registries (LIRs) in Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and FYROM. As of 22 May 2017, there are 68 LIRs registered in Greece.\n\nFigure 1: Number of LIRs in Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, FYROM and Albania on 22 May 2017\n\nFor comparison, Figure 2 shows the growth in the number of all LIRs registered with the RIPE NCC since 2008. There are currently over 15,700 LIRs registered with the RIPE NCC. Note that the numbers for 2017 only contain data up to 22 May.\n\nFigure 2: Number of all LIRs in the RIPE NCC service region from 2008 - 2017\n\nThe next figure shows the age of the LIRs in Greece. You can see that 18 LIRs in Greece have joined the RIPE NCC in  the past two years, while the next biggest grouping of Greek LIRs is those who are ten years or older.\n\nFigure 3: Age of LIRs in Greece\n\nFigure 3b: Age of all LIRs in RIPE NCC service region\n\nIPv6 RIPEness is a rating system that awards stars to LIRs in the RIPE NCC service region depending on indicators of IPv6 preparedness. Stars are awarded for:\n\nFigure 4 shows the situation in Greece. You can see that 79% of all LIRs in the country have an IPv6 allocation and 45% of Greek LIRs have done something with their IPv6 allocation.

The RIPE NCC is proud to be a sponsor of GRNOG and we recommend that all Greek operators follow its progress and get involved where possible.\n\nThe Greek story as seen from the RIPE NCC is one of very positive development in recent years, both in terms of numbers and the people-driven community. The number of LIRs in Greece has grown considerably in the last two years, while there is still a strong group of older members, contributing to a good mix of the experienced and newer players in the Greek environment. In terms of IPv6, Greece sits at around the average number of ASNs announcing IPv6 but this does not tell the whole story. Two of the larger ISPs in Greece have fully deployed, meaning that Greece ranks very highly in terms of IPv6-capable countries in Europe. Importantly, the local community has organised itself around a NOG that has become established and capable of attracting good local content as well as speakers from the wider community that bodes well for future developments in Greece."],[8,"8-year-old suicide: Student was beaten, kicked","Let friends in your social network know what you are reading about\n\nCINCINNATI — A security camera video taken inside a Cincinnati elementary school reveals that a student assaulted an 8-year-old boy in a restroom and other children may have kicked and struck the boy for 5 minutes while he lay unconscious.\n\nTwo days later, the child, Gabriel Taye, hanged himself.\n\nIn a report obtained by The Cincinnati Enquirer, a Cincinnati Police homicide detective describes the Jan. 24 Carson Elementary School video’s content: “I witnessed behavior that in my belief is bullying and could even rise to the level of criminal assault” if not for the young ages of the perpetrators.\n\nSchool officials did not tell Gabriel's mother about the assault or that he had lost consciousness, only that the boy had fainted, said Jennifer Branch, a lawyer for the boy's mother. Gabriel's mother has agreed to identify her child publicly but did not wish to release her own name.\n\n► Related: Is '13 Reasons Why' more controversial than other depictions of suicide?\n\nCarson Elementary officials are not commenting on the video or the assault, but a Cincinnati Public Schools statement took issue with the detective's characterization of multiple students beating Gabriel. School system officials said the video does not support that description and said they would release a version of the surveillance video, possibly by Friday, altered to blur the faces of the children to protect their identities. \n\nGabriel died Jan. 26, the first youth suicide in 2017 in Hamilton County, where Cincinnati is the largest city. Seven county residents 18 and younger have died in suicides so far this year.\n\nLast year, 13 occurred. The yearly average is about five.\n\nSchool spokeswoman Janet Walsh declined to answer any other questions about the situation. Walsh previously has said Carson Elementary had zero reports of bullying in the August-December term.\n\nIn January, Cincinnati Public Schools reported that the number of bullying incidents had declined systemwide:\n\n• In the 2014-15 school year, 319 incidents were reported.• In the 2015-16 school year, 265 were reported.• In the first semester of this school year, the number was 107.\n\nThe 8-year-old’s death triggered a police investigation.\n\nEric Karaguleff, a veteran Cincinnati homicide detective, wrote a Feb. 3 email, about a week after the boy’s death, to Jeff McKenzie, Carson's assistant principal. Carson principal Ruthenia Jackson and three other Cincinnati Public Schools officials were copied on the message.\n\nThe detective reported that the security-camera video was taken over the noon hour of Jan. 24 and focuses on a restroom entrance. Karaguleff viewed the video Feb. 1, six days after the 8-year-old boy’s death, and said he found it alarming.\n\n“I saw some concerning events, and I don’t even have a child at that school,\" Karaguleff wrote.\n\nKaraguleff composed a timeline for 18 minutes of video. Eleven minutes in, a boy enters the restroom, wearing a red and gray coat “with dyed hair sorta O’Dell Beckham Jr. style,” in the manner of the professional football player.\n\n► Related: Netflix adds warning to teen suicide series '13 Reasons Why'\n\nSix seconds later, kids flee the restroom. The boy in the red and gray coat hits another boy in the stomach, “sending him to the floor in all fours.”\n\nThe assailant then threatens another boy.\n\nThen Gabriel arrives “and appears to shake hands.” The boy in the red and gray coat yanks him to the ground and “appears to celebrate and rejoice in his behavior” as the victim lay motionless.\n\n► Related: Psychologists warn '13 Reasons Why' could inspire copycat suicides\n\nFor nearly 5 minutes after that, “many students step over, point, mock, nudge, kick, etc.,” the 8-year-old boy, Karaguleff wrote. Finally, McKenzie rushes into the restroom and finds the boy.\n\n“While we are concerned about the length of time that Gabriel lay motionless and the lack of adult supervision at the scene, when school administrators became aware of the situation they immediately followed protocol by calling the school nurse to evaluate Gabriel,\" according to a Cincinnati Public Schools statement.\n\n\"The school nurse checked Gabriel's vital signs, which were normal,\" according to the statement. \"She also contacted Gabriel's mother and asked her to pick him up and take him to the hospital to be checked out,” which Branch said no school official mentioned to Gabriel's mom.\n\nThe detective’s report said the school staff could best handle the issue, but he asked for the name and date of birth of the boy in the red and gray coat. This week, police spokesman Lt. Steve Saunders said the department concluded its investigation with no further action.\n\nOn the day of the assault, someone from Carson Elementary called the mother to say Gabriel fainted and was in the nurse’s office with normal vital signs, Branch said. The mother picked up her son and took him home.\n\nLater in the evening, Gabriel became nauseous and vomited twice, and his mother took him to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. Branch said the boy only told his mother his stomach hurt, adding that the mother believes he did not know what had happened that day.\n\n► Related: Schools warn about impact of show featuring teen suicide\n\nCincinnati Children’s kept Gabriel until about 6 a.m. ET Jan. 25 and decided he was suffering from stomach flu, not knowing about his potential for a head injury, Branch said. Exhausted, Gabriel stayed home from school that day.\n\nHe did go to school Jan. 26 and came home. But around 5:30 p.m., he went to his bedroom, knotted a loop in his necktie and hung himself from his bunk bed.\n\nCarson Elementary and school district officials did not tell the mother that Gabriel had been assaulted at school, Branch said.\n\n► Related: Read these young-adult books after watching '13 Reasons Why'\n\n“If the school had told her what had happened to him in the bathroom, that he was unconscious for such a long period of time, she would have taken him to the hospital immediately, reported that to the medical professionals, and she would have called police,” the lawyer said.\n\n“That’s why this is so frustrating for her, not knowing what really happened in that school,\" Branch said.\n\nFollow Anne Saker on Twitter: @apsaker"],[8,"Accelerationism: how a fringe philosophy predicted the future we live in","Half a century ago, in the great hippie year of 1967, an acclaimed young American science fiction writer, Roger Zelazny, published his third novel. In many ways, Lord of Light was of its time, shaggy with imported Hindu mythology and cosmic dialogue. Yet there were also glints of something more forward-looking and political. One plot strand concerned a group of revolutionaries who wanted to take their society “to a higher level” by suddenly transforming its attitude to technology. Zelazny called them the Accelerationists.\n\nHe and the book are largely forgotten now. But as the more enduring sci-fi novelist JG Ballard said in 1971, “what the writers of modern science fiction invent today, you and I will do tomorrow”. Over the past five decades, and especially over the past few years, much of the world has got faster. Working patterns, political cycles, everyday technologies, communication habits and devices, the redevelopment of cities, the acquisition and disposal of possessions – all of these have accelerated. Meanwhile, over the same half century, almost entirely unnoticed by the media or mainstream academia, accelerationism has gradually solidified from a fictional device into an actual intellectual movement: a new way of thinking about the contemporary world and its potential.\n\nAccelerationists argue that technology, particularly computer technology, and capitalism, particularly the most aggressive, global variety, should be massively sped up and intensified – either because this is the best way forward for humanity, or because there is no alternative. Accelerationists favour automation. They favour the further merging of the digital and the human. They often favour the deregulation of business, and drastically scaled-back government. They believe that people should stop deluding themselves that economic and technological progress can be controlled. They often believe that social and political upheaval has a value in itself.\n\nAccelerationism, therefore, goes against conservatism, traditional socialism, social democracy, environmentalism, protectionism, populism, nationalism, localism and all the other ideologies that have sought to moderate or reverse the already hugely disruptive, seemingly runaway pace of change in the modern world. “Accelerationism is a political heresy,” write Robin Mackay and Armen Avanessian in their introduction to #Accelerate: The Accelerationist Reader, a sometimes baffling, sometimes exhilarating book, published in 2014, which remains the only proper guide to the movement in existence.\n\nLike other heresies, accelerationism has had generations of adherents, declared or otherwise: passing its ideas on to each other, refining some and renouncing others, communicating with each other in a private language, coalescing around dominant figures, competing to make the faith’s next breakthrough, splitting into factions, burning out. There are, or have been, accelerationists from the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy and France. The movement has produced books, essays, journals, manifestos, blogs, social media battles – and cryptic, almost unclassifiable communiques combining dystopian fiction with a dizzying range of political, cultural and economic theory.\n\nOccasionally, accelerationists have held teaching posts at universities. They have held sporadic public gatherings, in order to think out loud, argue and acquire converts. A few recorded fragments of these can be found on YouTube: dim footage of intense young people talking mesmerically about the future, often with electronic music and abstract visuals churning in the background, to sometimes baffled audiences in badly lit lecture rooms.\n\nAt any one time, there have probably only been a few dozen accelerationists in the world. The label has only been in regular use since 2010, when it was borrowed from Zelazny’s novel by Benjamin Noys, a strong critic of the movement. Yet for decades longer than more orthodox contemporary thinkers, accelerationists have been focused on many of the central questions of the late 20th and early 21st centuries: the rise of China; the rise of artificial intelligence; what it means to be human in an era of addictive, intrusive electronic devices; the seemingly uncontrollable flows of global markets; the power of capitalism as a network of desires; the increasingly blurred boundary between the imaginary and the factual; the resetting of our minds and bodies by ever-faster music and films; and the complicity, revulsion and excitement so many of us feel about the speed of modern life.\n\n“We all live in an operating system set up by the accelerating triad of war, capitalism and emergent AI,” says Steve Goodman, a British accelerationist who has even smuggled its self-consciously dramatic ideas into dance music, via an acclaimed record label, Hyperdub. “Like it or not,” argues Steven Shaviro, an American observer of accelerationism, in his 2015 book on the movement, No Speed Limit, “we are all accelerationists now.”\n\nCelebrating speed and technology has its risks. A century ago, the writers and artists of the Italian futurist movement fell in love with the machines of the industrial era and their apparent ability to invigorate society. Many futurists followed this fascination into war-mongering and fascism. While some futurist works are still admired, the movement’s reputation has never recovered.\n\nOne of the central figures of accelerationism is the British philosopher Nick Land, who taught at Warwick University in the 1990s, and then abruptly left academia. “Philosophers are vivisectors,” he wrote in 1992. “They have the precise and reptilian intelligence shared by all who experiment with living things.” Iain Hamilton Grant, who was one of Land’s students, remembers: “There was always a tendency in all of us to bait the liberal, and Nick was the best at it.”\n\nSince Warwick, Land has published prolifically on the internet, not always under his own name, about the supposed obsolescence of western democracy; he has also written approvingly about “human biodiversity” and “capitalistic human sorting” – the pseudoscientific idea, currently popular on the far right, that different races “naturally” fare differently in the modern world; and about the supposedly inevitable “disintegration of the human species” when artificial intelligence improves sufficiently.\n\nOther accelerationists now distance themselves from Land. Grant, who teaches philosophy at the University of the West of England, says of him: “I try not to read his stuff. Folk [in the accelerationist movement] are embarrassed. They think he’s sounding like a thug. Anyone who’s an accelerationist, who’s reflective, does think: ‘How far is too far?’ But then again, even asking that question is the opposite of accelerationism.” Accelerationism is not about restraint.\n\nEven its critic Benjamin Noys concedes that the movement has an allure. “Accelerate is a sexy word,” he says – not a common thing in philosophy. The determinedly transgressive artists Jake and Dinos Chapman are associates of the movement and longstanding Land collaborators. One of their frenzied, grotesque paintings is on the cover of his collected writings, Fanged Noumena, published in 2011, which contains some of accelerationism’s most darkly fascinating passages. Earlier this year, secondhand copies of the paperback, which is now being reprinted, were on sale on Amazon for £180.\n\nIn our politically febrile times, the impatient, intemperate, possibly revolutionary ideas of accelerationism feel relevant, or at least intriguing, as never before. Noys says: “Accelerationists always seem to have an answer. If capitalism is going fast, they say it needs to go faster. If capitalism hits a bump in the road, and slows down” – as it has since the 2008 financial crisis – “they say it needs to be kickstarted.” The disruptive US election campaign and manic presidency of Donald Trump, and his ultra-capitalist, anti-government policies, have been seen by an increasing number of observers – some alarmed, some delighted – as the first mainstream manifestation of an accelerationist politics. In recent years, Noys has noticed accelerationist ideas “resonating” and being “circulated” everywhere from pro-technology parts of the British left to wealthy libertarian and far-right circles in America. On alt-right blogs, Land in particular has become a name to conjure with. Commenters have excitedly noted the connections between some of his ideas and the thinking of both the libertarian Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel and Trump’s iconoclastic strategist Steve Bannon.\n\n“In Silicon Valley,” says Fred Turner, a leading historian of America’s digital industries, “accelerationism is part of a whole movement which is saying, we don’t need [conventional] politics any more, we can get rid of ‘left’ and ‘right’, if we just get technology right. Accelerationism also fits with how electronic devices are marketed – the promise that, finally, they will help us leave the material world, all the mess of the physical, far behind.”\n\nTo Turner, the appeal of accelerationism is as much ancient as modern: “They are speaking in a millenarian idiom,” promising that a vague, universal change is close at hand. Noys warns that the accelerationists are trying to “claim the future”.\n\nIn some ways, Karl Marx was the first accelerationist. His Communist Manifesto of 1848 was as much awestruck as appalled by capitalism, with its “constant revolutionising of production” and “uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions”. He saw an ever more frantic capitalism as the essential prelude to the moment when the ordinary citizen “is at last compelled to face … his real conditions of life” and start a revolution.\n\nYet it was in France in the late 1960s that accelerationist ideas were first developed in a sustained way. Shaken by the failure of the leftwing revolt of 1968, and by the seemingly unending postwar economic boom in the west, some French Marxists decided that a new response to capitalism was needed. In 1972, the philosopher Gilles Deleuze and the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari published Anti-Oedipus. It was a restless, sprawling, appealingly ambiguous book, which suggested that, rather than simply oppose capitalism, the left should acknowledge its ability to liberate as well as oppress people, and should seek to strengthen these anarchic tendencies, “to go still further … in the movement of the market … to ‘accelerate the process’”.\n\nTwo years later, another disillusioned French Marxist, Jean-François Lyotard, extended the argument even more provocatively. His 1974 book Libidinal Economy declared that even the oppressive aspects of capitalism were “enjoyed” by those whose lives the system reordered and accelerated. And besides, there was no alternative: “The system of capital is, when all’s said and done, natural.”\n\nIn France, both books were controversial. Lyotard eventually disowned Libidinal Economy as his “evil book”, and moved on to other subjects. Deleuze and Guattari warned in their next book, A Thousand Plateaus, which was published in 1980 – as relatively benign postwar capitalism was being swept away by the wilder, harsher version of the Thatcher-Reagan era – that too much capitalist acceleration could suck society into “black holes” of fascism and nihilism.\n\nYet in Britain, Anti-Oedipus and Libidinal Economy acquired a different status. Like much of postwar French philosophy, for decades they were ignored by the academic mainstream, as too foreign in all senses, and were not even translated into English until 1983 and 1993 respectively. But, for a tiny number of British philosophers, the two books were a revelation. Iain Hamilton Grant first came across Libidinal Economy as a master’s student at Warwick in the early 90s. “I couldn’t believe it! For a book by a Marxist to say, ‘There’s no way out of this’, meaning capitalism, and that we are all tiny pieces of engineered desire, that slot into a huge system – that’s a first, as far as I know.” Grant “got hooked”. Instead of writing his dissertation, he spent an obsessive six months producing the first English translation.\n\nSuch exploratory philosophy projects were tolerated at Warwick in a way they were not at other British universities. Warwick had been founded in the 1960s as a university that would experiment and engage with the contemporary world. By the 1990s, its slightly isolated out-of-town campus of breeze-block towers and ziggurats looked worn rather than futuristic, but its original ethos lived on in some departments, such as philosophy, where studying avant-garde French writers was the norm. At the centre of this activity was a new young lecturer in the department, Nick Land.\n\nLand was a slight, fragile-looking man with an iron gaze, a soft but compelling voice, and an air of startling intellectual confidence. “Lots of people are clever,” says Grant, “but I’ve never witnessed anyone who could so forensically destroy a thesis.” Robin Mackay, who also became one of Land’s students, remembers: “Nick was always ready to say, ‘Don’t bother reading that.’ But he had read it all!”\n\nBy the early 90s Land had distilled his reading, which included Deleuze and Guattari and Lyotard, into a set of ideas and a writing style that, to his students at least, were visionary and thrillingly dangerous. Land wrote in 1992 that capitalism had never been properly unleashed, but instead had always been held back by politics, “the last great sentimental indulgence of mankind”. He dismissed Europe as a sclerotic, increasingly marginal place, “the racial trash-can of Asia”. And he saw civilisation everywhere accelerating towards an apocalypse: “Disorder must increase... Any [human] organisation is ... a mere ... detour in the inexorable death-flow.”\n\nLand gave strange, theatrical lectures: clambering over chairs as he spoke, or sitting hunched over, rocking back and forth. He also spiced his pronouncements with black humour. He would tell lecture audiences, “I work in the field of The Collapse of Western Civilisation Studies.” A quarter of a century on, some former Warwick philosophy students still talk about him with awe. Robin Mackay says, “I think he’s one of the most important philosophers of the last 50 years.”\n\nBut for a would-be guide to the future, Land was in some ways quite old-fashioned. Until the late 90s, he used an ancient green-screen Amstrad computer, and his initial Warwick writings contained far more references to 18th- and 19th-century philosophers – Friedrich Nietzsche was a fixation – than to contemporary thinkers or culture. The Warwick version of accelerationism did not crystallise fully until other radicals arrived in the philosophy department in the mid-90s.\n\nSadie Plant was one of them: a former Birmingham University lecturer in cultural studies, the study of modern popular culture. Mark Fisher, a former student of hers at Birmingham, was another incomer. He was jumpy and intense, while she was warm and approachable. For a time in the early 90s, she and Land were partners.\n\nLike Land, Plant and Fisher had both read the French accelerationists and were increasingly hostile to the hold they felt traditional leftwing and liberal ideas had on British humanities departments, and on the world beyond. Unlike Land, Plant and Fisher were technophiles: she had an early Apple computer, he was an early mobile phone user. “Computers ... pursue accelerating, exponential paths, proliferating, miniaturising, stringing themselves together,” wrote Plant in Zeroes and Ones, a caffeinated 1997 book about the development of computing. Plant and Fisher were also committed fans of the 90s’ increasingly kinetic dance music and action films, which they saw as popular art forms that embodied the possibilities of the new digital era.\n\nWith the internet becoming part of everyday life for the first time, and capitalism seemingly triumphant after the collapse of communism in 1989, a belief that the future would be almost entirely shaped by computers and globalisation – the accelerated “movement of the market” that Deleuze and Guattari had called for two decades earlier – spread across British and American academia and politics during the 90s. The Warwick accelerationists were in the vanguard.\n\nYet there were two different visions of the future. In the US, confident, rainbow-coloured magazines such as Wired promoted what became known as “the Californian ideology”: the optimistic claim that human potential would be unlocked everywhere by digital technology. In Britain, this optimism influenced New Labour. At Warwick, however, the prophecies were darker. “One of our motives,” says Plant, “was precisely to undermine the cheery utopianism of the 90s, much of which seemed very conservative” – an old-fashioned male desire for salvation through gadgets, in her view. “We wanted a more open, convoluted, complicated world, not a shiny new order.”\n\nThe Warwick accelerationists were also influenced by their environment. “Britain in the 90s felt cramped, grey, dilapidated,” says Mackay, “We saw capitalism and technology as these intense forces that were trying to take over a decrepit body.” To observe the process, and help hasten it, in 1995 Plant, Fisher, Land, Mackay and two dozen other Warwick students and academics created a radical new institution: the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU). It would become one of the most mythologised groups in recent British intellectual history.\n\nThe CCRU existed as a fully functional entity for less than five years. For some of that time, it was based in a single office in the tight corridors of the Warwick philosophy department, of which it was an unofficial part. Later, the unit’s headquarters was a rented room in the Georgian town centre of nearby Leamington Spa, above a branch of the Body Shop.\n\nFor decades, tantalising references to the CCRU have flitted across political and cultural websites, music and art journals, and the more cerebral parts of the style press. “There are groups of students in their 20s who re-enact our practices,” says Robin Mackay. Since 2007, he has run a respected philosophy publishing house, Urbanomic, with limited editions of old CCRU publications and new collections of CCRU writings prominent among its products.\n\nThe CCRU was image-conscious from the start. Its name was deliberately hard-edged, with a hint of the military or the robotic, especially once its members began writing and referring to themselves collectively, without a definite article, as “Ccru”. In 1999, itsummarised its history to the sympathetic music journalist Simon Reynolds in the terse, disembodied style that was a trademark: “Ccru ... triggers itself from October 1995, when it uses Sadie Plant as a screen and Warwick University as a temporary habitat ... Ccru feeds on graduate students + malfunctioning academic (Nick Land) + independent researchers ...”\n\nFormer CCRU members still use its language, and are fiercely attached to the idea that it became a kind of group mind. Land told me in an email: “Ccru was an entity ... irreducible to the agendas, or biographies, of its component sub-agencies ... Utter submission to The Entity was key.”\n\nThese days, Iain Hamilton Grant is an affable, middle-aged professor who wears a waistcoat with a pen in the top pocket. Yet when I asked him to describe the CCRU, he said with sudden intensity: “We made up an arrow! There was almost no disharmony. There was no leisure. We tried not to be apart from each other. No one dared let the side down. When everyone is keeping up with everyone else, the collective element increased is speed.”\n\nThe CCRU gang formed reading groups and set up conferences and journals. They squeezed into the narrow CCRU room in the philosophy department and gave each other impromptu seminars. Mackay remembers Steve Goodman, a CCRU member who was particularly interested in military technology and how it was transforming civilian life, “drawing yin and yang on the blackboard, and then talking about helicopters. It wasn’t academic point-scoring – that was exactly what we had all got heartily sick of before the CCRU. Instead it was a build-up of shared references.”\n\nGrant explained: “Something would be introduced into the group. Neuromancer [William Gibson’s 1984 novel about the internet and artificial intelligence] got into the philosophy department, and it went viral. You’d find worn-out paperbacks all over the common room.”\n\nLand and Plant’s offices in the department also became CCRU hubs. “They were generous with their time,” said Grant, “And he had good drugs – skunk [cannabis]. Although it could be grim going in there, once he started living in his office. There would be a tower of Pot Noodles and underwear drying on the radiator, which he had washed in the staff loos.”\n\nThe Warwick campus stayed open late. When the philosophy department shut for the night, the CCRU decamped to the student union bar across the road, where Land would pay for all the drinks, and then to each other’s houses, where the group mind would continue its labours. “It was like Andy Warhol’s Factory,” said Grant. “Work and production all the time.”\n\nIn 1996, the CCRU listed its interests as “cinema, complexity, currencies, dance music, e-cash, encryption, feminism, fiction, images, inorganic life, jungle, markets, matrices, microbiotics, multimedia, networks, numbers, perception, replication, sex, simulation, sound, telecommunications, textiles, texts, trade, video, virtuality, war”. Today, many of these topics are mainstream media and political fixations. Two decades ago, says Grant, “We felt we were the only people on the planet who were taking all this stuff seriously.” The CCRU’s aim was to meld their preoccupations into a groundbreaking, infinitely flexible intellectual alloy – like the shape-shifting cyborg in the 1991 film Terminator 2, a favourite reference point – which would somehow sum up both the present and the future.\n\nThe main result of the CCRU’s frantic, promiscuous research was a conveyor belt of cryptic articles, crammed with invented terms, sometimes speculative to the point of being fiction. A typical piece from 1996, “Swarmachines”, included a section on jungle, then the most intense strain of electronic dance music: “Jungle functions as a particle accelerator, seismic bass frequencies engineering a cellular drone which immerses the body ... rewinds and reloads conventional time into silicon blips of speed ... It’s not just music. Jungle is the abstract diagram of planetary inhuman becoming.”\n\nThe Warwick accelerationists saw themselves as participants, not traditional academic observers. They bought jungle records, went to clubs and organised DJs to play at eclectic public conferences, which they held at the university to publicise accelerationist ideas and attract like minds. Grant remembers these gatherings, staged in 1994, 1995 and 1996 under the name Virtual Futures, as attracting “every kind of nerd under the sun: science fiction fans, natural scientists, political scientists, philosophers from other universities”, but also cultural trend-spotters: “Someone from [the fashion magazine] the Face came to the first one.”\n\nLike CCRU prose, the conferences could be challenging for non-initiates. Virtual Futures 96 was advertised as “an anti-disciplinary event” and “a conference in the post-humanities”. One session involved Nick Land “lying on the ground, croaking into a mic”, recalls Robin Mackay, while Mackay played jungle records in the background. “Some people were really appalled by it. They wanted a standard talk. One person in the audience stood up, and said, ‘Some of us are still Marxists, you know.’ And walked out.”\n\nEven inside the permissive Warwick philosophy department, the CCRU’s ever more blatant disdain for standard academic practice became an issue. Ray Brassier watched it happen. Now an internationally known philosopher at the American University in Beirut, between 1995 and 2001 he was a part-time mature student at Warwick.\n\n“I was interested in the CCRU, but sceptical,” Brassier says. “I was a bit older than most of them. The CCRU felt they were plunging into something bigger than academia, and they did put their finger on a lot of things that had started to happen in the world. But their work was also frustrating. They would cheerfully acknowledge the thinness of their research: ‘It’s not about knowledge.’ Yet if thinking is just connecting things, of course it’s exciting, like taking amphetamines. But thinking is also about disconnecting things.”\n\nBrassier says that the CCRU became a “very divisive” presence in the philosophy department. “Most of the department really hated and despised Nick – and that hatred extended to his students.” There were increasingly blunt bureaucratic disputes about the CCRU’s research, and how, if at all, it should be externally regulated and assessed. In 1997, Plant resigned from the university. “The charged personal, political and philosophical dynamics of the CCRU were irresistible to many, but I felt stifled and had to get out,” she told me. She became a full-time writer, and for a few years was the British media’s favourite digital academic, an “IT girl for the 21st century”, as the Independent breathlessly billed her in October 1997.\n\nIn 1998, Land resigned from Warwick too. He and half a dozen CCRU members withdrew to the room above the Leamington Spa Body Shop. There they drifted from accelerationism into a vortex of more old-fashioned esoteric ideas, drawn from the occult, numerology, the fathomless novels of the American horror writer HP Lovecraft, and the life of the English mystic Aleister Crowley, who had been born in Leamington, in a cavernous terraced house which several CCRU members moved into.\n\n“The CCRU became quasi-cultish, quasi-religious,” says Mackay. “I left before it descended into sheer madness.” Two of the unit’s key texts had always been the Joseph Conrad novel Heart of Darkness and its film adaptation, Apocalypse Now, which made collecting followers and withdrawing from the world and from conventional sanity seem lethally glamorous. In their top-floor room, Land and his students drew occult diagrams on the walls. Grant says a “punishing regime” of too much thinking and drinking drove several members into mental and physical crises. Land himself, after what he later described as “perhaps a year of fanatical abuse” of “the sacred substance amphetamine”, and “prolonged artificial insomnia ... devoted to futile ‘writing’ practices”, suffered a breakdown in the early 2000s, and disappeared from public view.\n\n“The CCRU just vanished,” says Brassier. “And a lot of people – not including me – thought, ‘Good riddance.’”\n\nHalf a dozen years later, at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, a mild-mannered political science master’s student, Nick Srnicek, began reading a British blog about pop culture and politics called k-punk. K-punk had been going since 2003, and had acquired a cult following among academics and music critics for its unselfconscious roaming from records and TV shows to recent British history and French philosophy.\n\nK-punk was written by Mark Fisher, formerly of the CCRU. The blog retained some Warwick traits, such as quoting reverently from Deleuze and Guattari, but it gradually shed the CCRU’s aggressive rhetoric and pro-capitalist politics for a more forgiving, more left-leaning take on modernity. Fisher increasingly felt that capitalism was a disappointment to accelerationists, with its cautious, entrenched corporations and endless cycles of essentially the same products. But he was also impatient with the left, which he thought was ignoring new technology when it should have been exploiting it. Srnicek agreed. He and Fisher became friends.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis, and the left’s ineffectual, rather old-fashioned response to it – such as the short-lived street protests of the Occupy movement – further convinced Srnicek that an updated radical politics was needed. In 2013, he and a young British political theorist, Alex Williams, co-wrote a Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics. “Capitalism has begun to constrain the productive forces of technology,” they wrote. “[Our version of] accelerationism is the basic belief that these capacities can and should be let loose … repurposed towards common ends … towards an alternative modernity.”\n\nWhat that “alternative modernity” might be was barely, but seductively, sketched out, with fleeting references to reduced working hours, to technology being used to reduce social conflict rather than exacerbate it, and to humanity moving “beyond the limitations of the earth and our own immediate bodily forms”. On politics and philosophy blogs from Britain to the US and Italy, the notion spread that Srnicek and Williams had founded a new political philosophy: “left accelerationism”.\n\nTwo years later, in 2015, they expanded the manifesto into a slightly more concrete book, Inventing the Future. It argued for an economy based as far as possible on automation, with the jobs, working hours and wages lost replaced by a universal basic income. The book attracted more attention than a speculative leftwing work had for years, with interest and praise from intellectually curious leftists such as the Labour MP Jon Cruddas and the authors Paul Mason and Mike Davis.\n\nYet the actual word accelerationism did not appear in the book. “We’ve given up on the term now,” Srnicek told me. “It’s been too popularised. And we don’t just want everything to go faster, anyway. Arguing for a shorter working week is arguing for people’s lives to slow down.”\n\nThe 2013 manifesto had mentioned Land’s earlier version of accelerationism in passing, describing it as “acute” and “hypnotising”, but also “myopic” and “confused”. When Srnicek and I met – appropriately, he chose a futuristic public space: a cafe in the angular new extension to Tate Modern – I asked how he regarded Land and the CCRU’s work now. “Land’s stuff is a valid reading of Deleuze and Guattari,” he began politely. “But the inhumanism of it all ... And I’m not sure if returning to the CCRU’s texts is that interesting – all that word-play … Using the word ‘cyber’ seems very 90s.”\n\nI asked Land what he thought of left accelerationism. “The notion that self-propelling technology is separable from capitalism,” he said, “is a deep theoretical error.”\n\nAfter his breakdown, Land left Britain. He moved to Taiwan “early in the new millennium”, he told me, then to Shanghai “a couple of years later”. He still lives there now. “Life as an outsider was a relief.” China was also thrilling. In a 2004 article for the Shanghai Star, an English-language paper, he described the modern Chinese fusion of Marxism and capitalism as “the greatest political engine of social and economic development the world has ever known”. At Warwick, he and the CCRU had often written excitedly, but with little actual detail, about what they called “neo-China”. Once he lived there, Land told me, he realised that “to a massive degree” China was already an accelerationist society: fixated by the future and changing at speed. Presented with the sweeping projects of the Chinese state, his previous, libertarian contempt for the capabilities of governments fell away.\n\nBack in less revolutionary Britain, Land’s Chinese journalism, a strange amalgam of pro-government propaganda, PR hyperbole, and wild CCRU imagery – “At World Expo 2010 Shanghai … parallel tracks melt together, into the largest discrete event in world history” – went either unnoticed or pointedly ignored during the 2000s and early 2010s. Among the steadily rising number of people with an interest in accelerationism, there was a feeling that Land had taken the philosophy in inappropriate directions.\n\nOther members of the Warwick diaspora made less controversial accommodations with the modern world. Suzanne Livingston, a former CCRU member, joined the international branding agency Wolff Olins, and used PhD work she had done at Warwick on robotics and artificial intelligence to help technology corporations such as Sony and Ericsson. Steve Goodman set up the electronic music label Hyperdub in 2004, and began releasing skeletal, ominous dubstep records, by the lauded south London artist Burial among others, sometimes with accelerationist messages deep within. “It’s like an onion,” he says. “Our audience are welcome to peel off as many layers as they want – some will make their eyes water, so we don’t force feed.”\n\nBetween 2002 and 2014, Goodman also lectured in music culture at the University of East London (UEL), which, along with Goldsmiths College in south London, is a frequent employer of former CCRU members. “The Warwick lot are still a group of friends, devoted and loyal to each other,” says a former UEL colleague of Goodman’s. “That’s the good way of putting it. The other way is to say that the CCRU cult thing never stopped.”\n\nWhether British accelerationism is a cult or not, Robin Mackay is at the centre of it. Besides publishing its key texts through Urbanomic, he has kept in touch with most of his former Warwick comrades, even Land, who he has known, and often defended, for 25 years. But Mackay is a less unsettling presence. Forty-three now, he has lived for a decade in a plain village in inland Cornwall. He met me at the nearest station, wearing a severe black shirt and playing complicated techno on his car stereo, with one of his children in the back.\n\nIn the living room of his half-renovated cottage, blinds down against the lovely spring day, Mackay talked about accelerationism and its serpentine history for hours, smoking throughout – an old CCRU habit – and blinking slowly between his long sentences, so deliberately and regularly you could see him thinking. Near the end, he said: “Accelerationism is a machine for countering pessimism. In considering untapped possibilities, you can feel less gloomy about the present.” Mackay said he had experienced periods of depression. His close friend, Mark Fisher, who also had depression, took his own life this January.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Fisher was increasingly preoccupied by the idea that Britain was not heading towards some great leap forward, but stasis. For all the freneticism of modern life, in some ways even the most developed countries still live in the opposite of accelerated times: the same parties seemingly perpetually in power; the same sluggish capitalism, still struggling for momentum a decade after the financial crisis; the same yearnings for the good old days, expressed by elderly Brexit voters and nostalgic leftists alike.\n\nEven the thinking of the arch-accelerationist Nick Land, who is 55 now, may be slowing down. Since 2013, he has become a guru for the US-based far-right movement neoreaction, or NRx as it often calls itself. Neoreactionaries believe in the replacement of modern nation-states, democracy and government bureaucracies by authoritarian city states, which on neoreaction blogs sound as much like idealised medieval kingdoms as they do modern enclaves such as Singapore.\n\nIn 2013, Land wrote a long online essay about the movement, titled with typical theatricality “The Dark Enlightenment”, which has become widely seen as one of neoreraction’s founding documents. Land argues now that neoreaction, like Trump and Brexit, is something that accelerationists should support, in order to hasten the end of the status quo. Yet the analyst of accelerationism Ray Brassier is unconvinced: “Nick Land has gone from arguing ‘Politics is dead’, 20 years ago, to this completely old-fashioned, standard reactionary stuff.” Neoreaction has a faith in technology and a following in Silicon Valley, but in other ways it seems a backward-looking cause for accelerationists to ally themselves with.\n\nWithout a dynamic capitalism to feed off, as Deleuze and Guattari had in the early 70s, and the Warwick philosophers had in the 90s, it may be that accelerationism just races up blind alleys. In his 2014 book about the movement, Malign Velocities, Benjamin Noys accuses it of offering “false” solutions to current technological and economic dilemmas. With accelerationism, he writes, a breakthrough to a better future is “always promised and always just out of reach”.\n\nIn 1970, the American writer Alvin Toffler, an exponent of accelerationism’s more playful intellectual cousin, futurology, published Future Shock, a book about the possibilities and dangers of new technology. Toffler predicted the imminent arrival of artificial intelligence, cryonics, cloning and robots working behind airline check-in desks. “The pace of change accelerates,” concluded a documentary version of the book, with a slightly hammy voiceover by Orson Welles. “We are living through one of the greatest revolutions in history – the birth of a new civilisation.”\n\nShortly afterwards, the 1973 oil crisis struck. World capitalism did not accelerate again for almost a decade. For much of the “new civilisation” Toffler promised, we are still waiting. But Future Shock has sold millions of copies anyway. One day an accelerationist may do the same.\n\n• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."],[8,"Russian ambassador told Moscow that Kushner wanted secret communications channel with Kremlin","Jared Kushner and Russia’s ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump’s transition team and the Kremlin, using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring, according to U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports.\n\nAmbassador Sergey Kislyak reported to his superiors in Moscow that Kushner, son-in-law and confidant to then-President-elect Trump, made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower, according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials. Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications.\n\nThe meeting also was attended by Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser.\n\nThe White House disclosed the meeting only in March, playing down its significance. But people familiar with the matter say the FBI now considers the encounter, as well as another meeting Kushner had with a Russian banker, to be of investigative interest.\n\nKislyak reportedly was taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate — a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team.\n\nNeither the meeting nor the communications of Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, declined to comment. The Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRussia at times feeds false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U.S. analysts. But officials said that it’s unclear what Kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with Kushner to Moscow, particularly at a time when the Kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improved relations with Trump.\n\nKushner’s apparent interest in establishing a secret channel with Moscow, rather than relying on U.S. government systems, has added to the intrigue surrounding the Trump administration’s relationship with Russia.\n\nTo some officials, it also reflects a staggering naivete.\n\nThe FBI closely monitors the communications of Russian officials in the United States, and it maintains a nearly constant surveillance of its diplomatic facilities. The National Security Agency monitors the communications of Russian officials overseas.\n\nCurrent and former U.S. intelligence officials said that although Russian diplomats have secure means of communicating with Moscow, Kushner’s apparent request for access to such channels was extraordinary.\n\n“How would he trust that the Russians wouldn’t leak it on their side?” said one former senior intelligence official. The FBI would know that a Trump transition official was going in and out of the embassy, which would cause “a great deal” of concern, he added. The entire idea, he said, “seems extremely naive or absolutely crazy.”\n\nThe discussion of a secret channel adds to a broader pattern of efforts by Trump’s closest advisers to obscure their contacts with Russian counterparts. Trump’s first national security adviser, Flynn, was forced to resign after a series of false statements about his conversations with Kislyak. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from matters related to the Russia investigation after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose his own meetings with Kislyak when asked during congressional testimony about any contact with Russians.\n\nKushner’s interactions with Russians — including Kislyak and an executive for a Russian bank under U.S. sanctions — were not acknowledged by the White House until they were exposed in media reports.\n\nIt is common for senior advisers of a newly elected president to be in contact with foreign leaders and officials. But new administrations are generally cautious in their handling of interactions with Moscow, which U.S. intelligence agencies have accused of waging an unprecedented campaign to interfere in last year’s presidential race and help elect Trump.\n\nObama administration officials say members of the Trump transition team never approached them about arranging a secure communications channel with their Russian contacts, possibly because of concerns about leaks.\n\nThe State Department, the White House National Security Council and U.S. intelligence agencies all have the ability to set up secure communications channels with foreign leaders, though doing so for a transition team would be unusual.\n\nTrump’s advisers were similarly secretive about meetings with leaders from the United Arab Emirates. The Obama White House only learned that the crown prince of Abu Dhabi was flying to New York in December to see Kushner, Flynn and Stephen K. Bannon, another top Trump adviser, because U.S. border agents in the UAE spotted the Emirate leader’s name on a flight manifest.\n\nRussia would also have had reasons of its own to reject such an overture from Kushner. Doing so would require Moscow to expose its most sophisticated communications capabilities — which are likely housed in highly secure locations at diplomatic compounds — to an American.\n\nThe Post was first alerted in mid-December to the meeting by an anonymous letter, which said, among other things, that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel. This week, officials who reviewed the letter and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence said the portion about the secret channel was consistent with their understanding of events.\n\nFor instance, according to those officials and the letter, Kushner conveyed to the Russians that he was aware that it would be politically sensitive to meet publicly, but it was necessary for the Trump team to be able to continue their communication with Russian government officials.\n\nIn addition to their discussion about setting up the communications channel, Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a “Russian contact” in a third country whose name was not identified, according to the anonymous letter.\n\nThe Post reported in April that Erik Prince, the founder of the private security firm Blackwater, now called Academi, and an informal adviser to the Trump transition team,met on Jan. 11 — nine days before Trump’s inauguration — in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean with a representative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRead more:"],[8,"Scotland + Venice unveils major new film commission","Published: 09 May 2017\n\nThe Scotland + Venice partnership today unveils Spite Your Face, a major new film commission by Edinburgh College of Art educated artist Rachel Maclean for the 57th International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia.\n\nSupported through Creative Scotland with funding from the National Lottery, the exhibition is curated by Alchemy Film and Arts, in partnership with Talbot Rice Gallery and the University of Edinburgh. It is a modern-day, dark Venetian fairytale presented as a large-scale portrait projection at the altar of the deconsecrated church, Chiesa di Santa Caterina, Cannaregio.\n\nReferencing the Italian folk-tale The Adventures of Pinocchio, Maclean’s new commission offers a powerful critique of contemporary society, critiquing the underlying fears and desires that characterise the zeitgeist we find ourselves in today. Spite Your Faceis a tale across two worlds - with a bright, glittering and ordered upper world, and a warped, dirty, impoverished lower world - where the lure of wealth, power and adoration entices a destitute young boy into the shimmering riches of the kingdom above.\n\nRachel Maclean, artist, says:\n\n“With this new film I set out to respond to significant changes in the political climate in the UK and abroad over the last 12 months - in particular the divisive campaigns in the lead up to the Brexit vote and the US Presidential election. These events have been central in heralding a new post-truth era, where politicians feel free to say what they want to help them gain popular support, with little regard for factual accuracy.\n\n\"The Venetian context also inspired my new work, drawing ideas and images from the city’s history. In particular, the architecture of the venue (a dramatic deconsecrated church) emphasises the topsy-turvy world depicted in the film, with the projection installed vertically in the alter space, rather than the traditional horizontal film format.\n\n\"This new Scotland + Venice commission is a darkly comic moral tale, depicting a post-truth dystopia where the world is turned on its head, leaving the characters untethered to any sense of right and wrong, truth and lies.”\n\nThe story, conveyed by a continuous film loop where the beginning seamlessly connects to the end, is told through the lives of two central characters, both acted and directed by Maclean: PIC, the central (English-speaking) protagonist who starts off as a young boy and grows to maturity during the film; and a Madonna-like figure (Italian-speaking, English subtitles) who embodies the moral compass. A third character – a manipulative salesman (also played by Maclean) - journeys with PIC through his moral corruption and corresponding rise to celebrity and power.\n\nAlchemy Film & Arts worked with the Glasgow-based production company, Barry Crerar to produce the commission, involving studio based green-screen techniques, custom prosthetics, costume, and voice actors.\n\nRichard Ashrowan, Curator, Alchemy Film & Arts, said:\n\n“Maclean is known for her bold originality and unflinching ability to satirise the economies of desire and wish fulfilment inherent in contemporary life. In this new film, she has turned her penetrating gaze to the nebulous question of truth, its relationship to current political discourse, greed and the will to power. It questions our fundamental desire for a better life, while asking which brand of truth we will choose in the pursuit of an ideal life.\n\n\"Maclean is an artist whose work speaks powerfully to our generation, with unsettling clarity and an uncanny astuteness, while reflecting Scotland’s own energised spirit of political reinvention.”\n\nAmanda Catto, Head of Visual Arts at Creative Scotland, on behalf of the Scotland + Venice Partnership, said:\n\n“The Scotland + Venice partners are delighted to be presenting Rachel Maclean’s remarkable new film work at this year’s Venice Biennale. Rachel possesses a unique and compelling vision and Venice offers a significant international platform for her work.\n\n\"Founded in 2003 the Scotland + Venice project continues to raise the profile of Scotland as a dynamic and evolving centre for the production, promotion and presentation of contemporary art.

It cannot be right that the council ran a budget surplus whilst families in their borough were living in such unsafe housing. That is simply unacceptable.\n\n“The people of Kensington and Chelsea are angry and they have every right to be. We need answers and we need justice. Serious questions have to be asked about why the council was running a budget surplus when the Grenfell residents were warning about fire risks.”\n\nMr Gwynne said: “The council needs to immediately explain why these funds were not used to ensure safe housing for Kensington and Chelsea residents. There are too many opportunities for this tragedy to have been avoided.\n\nAt this time of intense stress and trauma, the least that these communities deserve are answers.”\n\n Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat's shadow Home Secretary, said: “The immediate priority must be to look after survivors and their families but we do also need answers. One of the questions is why the council had £270m in reserve but apparently couldn't afford sprinklers.”\n\nIn 2013/14, RBKC underspent by £30m “thanks to an overachieving efficiency drive,” according to Council Leader Nick Paget-Brown. Instead of reinvesting the funds, top rate council tax-payers were subsequently offered a £100 rebate to account for the overspend. \n\n“In deciding what to do with it, we have taken the view that it is simply wrong to discount from our calculations those whose money this was in the first place. In short, we think the right place for it is back with our residents,” Mr Paget-Brown wrote at the time. \n\nWhile some of the reserve money is ring-fenced, the revelation follows claims that additional spending on the west London block could have prevented the tragedy that killed at least 58 people on Wednesday.\n\nQuestions were raised about the cladding that was fitted to the building during a 2015 refurbishment, which experts suggested may have helped the flames spread more rapidly throughout the tower than they would otherwise have. \n\nFitting a fire-resistant alternative would have cost as little as £5,000 extra to instal. The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association also said installing a sprinkler system would cost just £200,000. \n\n“We have heard that the council gave residents a £100 rebate in 2014, when just £5,000 would have paid for non-flammable cladding on the outside of Grenfell Tower,” Mr Lammy said. \n\nIt follows claims by Labour Councillor Robert Atkinson the council was “bribing the electorate with its own money” after it “systematically and deliberately created underspends”.\n\n“Our suspicion, based on past experience, remains that this council will bring in and hoard the people’s money in non election years (such as this) only to give it back as a pre-election bribe immediately before a council election – such as next year,” he said in a speech after 2017’s budget was announced. \n\n“We think this council’s long standing practises of, every year, running huge underspends in its revenue budgets which it then transfers into Capital reserves is wrong, and, given the damage to services that has resulted over many years from the squeezing of revenue budgets it is not to put too fine a point on it – wicked.”\n\nMr Paget-Brown justified the rebate in 2014, saying it could not be ploughed back into services because it was a “one-off surplus”. Despite this, over the last four years, the General Fund at RBKC has consistently underspent, with draft figures for 2016/2017 showing a surplus of £10m.\n\nThe underspend figures come in contrast to those produced by the Borough of Islington, which has a similar demographic makeup to Kensington. In 2015/16, the Council underspent by £0.2m. In the same year, Newham, one of London’s poorest boroughs, underspent by £311,000. \n\nThe Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy details three reasons for a council to have reserves, one of which is to act as a “contingency cushion” for unexpected emergencies or events. But residents of the gutted block were growing increasingly angry over the council’s relief efforts following the fire. \n\nProtesters stormed Kensington Town Hall chanting “justice” on Friday, carrying a list of demands they said authorities must meet. The Government was criticised for seemingly U-turning on a pledge to rehouse residents affected by the blaze within the borough, admitting on Friday that they may have to be relocated to other areas in London.\n\nDespite the budget surplus, it appeared the RBKC was struggling to find accommodation in the borough for residents who were left homeless in the blaze.\n\nGrieving relatives of the dead pointed to the repeated failures by those managing the properties to prevent such a tragedy on an unprecedented scale. \n\nResidents of Grenfell Tower complained two years ago about the refurbishment of the building being done “using cheap materials” and workmanship that “cut corners”, The Independent revealed. \n\nThey later claimed the RBKC had done nothing to address their concerns.\n\nIt has also emerged that in order to save money, the council ditched the original proposed contractor, Leadbitter, for the refurbishment, and instead went with Rydon, a cheaper bid for the work.\n\nIn July 2013 the council’s Housing and Property Scrutiny Committee proposed to “market test the works through an open tender” after noting: “Leadbitter currently estimate the cost of the works to be £1.6m above the current, proposed budget.”\n\nRydon eventually completed the refurbishment in May 2016, for £2.5m less than the £11.278m quoted by Leadbitter.\n\nRydon has repeatedly said that all the refurbishment work carried out at Grenfell Tower met both building and fire regulation standards and was signed off by the council.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the RBKC for comment. "],[8,"The New York Times’ The Daily vs. NPR’s Up First: Which morning news podcast is better at what?","Welcome to Hot Pod, a newsletter about podcasts. This is issue 121, published May 30, 2017.\n\nBack from vacation, folks. We’re talking conventions, independent media, The Daily v. Up First, and careers. Let’s get to it.\n\nThere’s a new addition on the horizon, one that sports a notable heritage: this December will see the inaugural edition of PodCon, a podcast convention by Hank Green, the largely internet-based personality who is also responsible for, among many other things, the YouTube series vlogbrothers, the podcast Dear Hank & John, the Internet Creators Guild, and, most pertinently, VidCon, the popular online video conference. The convention will take place in Seattle. The lineup of attending shows thus far includes Lore, Radiotopia’s Criminal, the McElroy brothers, and Night Vale Presents. Green is bringing in his team of experienced convention producers to organize PodCon, and Night Vale’s Joseph Fink is playing an active role in curating the lineup.\n\nPodCon is meant to be distinctly fan-oriented, Fink told me. “Podcast conventions and festivals have mostly either focused on a specific kind of podcasting (comedy, documentary, etc.) or focused on the technical or business side (essentially the podcaster side of podcasting, rather than the listener),” he said. “We really want to create convention that treats podcasting as a broad and diverse art form, and that is primarily for fans, whether those fans are also podcast makers or not.”\n\nGreen concurred, describing a convention that threads both sides of the creator-audience relationship. “We think the people who love podcasts deserve and want to be included in conversations about issues the field is facing, from diversity to monetization. We think the wall between professional discussion and community celebration is not real,” he said.\n\nAccording to Green, the convention will chiefly be funded through ticket sales, both through an Indiegogo campaign that currently serves as the event’s primary web presence — as of Monday morning, it has raised about $81,000 of a $300,000 goal — and ticket sales that happen afterward. (The campaign features several contribution tiers, but backers need to provide a minimum of $90 for admission to the actual convention. For reference, the standard admission pricing for VidCon is at $150 for fans, and $200 for creators.) The Indiegogo campaign was deployed mostly to get a sense of the event’s scope; I’m told that the convention will proceed regardless of what happens with the campaign. The organizing team holds out some hope that there will be sponsors, noting that it’s very hard for first-year events to wrangle in sponsorship. (Though given the fact that VidCon eventually locked down YouTube as an advertiser for that convention, I suspect they’ll be fine.)\n\nSo, why Seattle? It’s podcast country, Fink told me. “People in the Northwest really love podcasts. Night Vale has done some huge shows in New York and London, but by far the biggest show we’ve done was in Seattle. We consistently see the most excitement for our events in the Bay Area, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver. In my mind, that’s podcast country,” he said.\n\nYou can find out more about PodCon on its Indiegogo page.\n\nOn podcasting and independent media. Given Green’s extensive history with independent internet media and YouTube — with all its opportunities and travails over time — I was curious about Green’s take on the current state of the ecosystem. He was kind enough to oblige:\n\nIt’s a mixed bag, like any media. I like that it’s harder to control and consolidate because the technology underneath it is so simple, but it’s also gotten extremely hard to break into. Production costs can be the lowest of any media, but if you want to get noticed these days, it’s much easier if you’ve got money and experience (or a pre-existing audience). Because it can be so cheap to produce, we’ve seen an influx of people with existing audiences moving into podcasting (like me, for example), which I have mixed feelings about — obviously not so mixed that I don’t do it, because I love it, but I do see it as making the medium less meritocratic. Monetization is pretty sustainable if you can put together a fairly large audience, but unavailable to smaller podcasts, which is a shame. But ad rates are fairly high and competition for podcast ad slots seems to be getting more heated, which is good. As the consumption of podcasts has become a more understood and normal thing, and a path to revenue has gotten more clear, a huge diverse range of genres and styles have emerged. Some of that has happened under the umbrella of networks that, from my perspective thus far, have been pretty up front and fair. And some of it has happened independently. I think that’s all part of a pretty healthy ecosystem.\n\nRadiotopia readies Ear Hustle for launch. The podcast indie label’s latest addition, which features stories of life in prison produced by the people who live them, is set to roll out its first episode on June 14. To mark the occasion and to promote the show, Radiotopia has prepared a unique launch strategy: between June 1 and 15, all other 16 Radiotopia shows (!) will drop episodes around the theme of “doing time.” A preview of Ear Hustle is already up in its feed.\n\nNotes on the morning news front. When on vacation, I try to stay unplugged. I make an effort to keep away from the news (I tried), to avoid Twitter (I really tried), and to not do too much work (ha) in favor of more immediate experiences, like actually being present for human conversation, or savoring details (the smell of flowers, the ashy taste of Claritin). I also established a moratorium on podcasts for a bit, though I, eventually, made an exception for two shows: NYT’s The Daily and NPR’s Up First. I suppose I couldn’t stay away all that much.\n\nThird Coast Festival tweet-polled its followers on which show they preferred, and while the poll shouldn’t be taken to say anything other than the preferences of TCF’s Twitter followers, it does present us with a good opportunity to take stock of their efforts in relation to each other so far. The question about which production is better is, as always, a super fun one, but as polite argument goes, such a paradigm may well be educationally limited. Both podcasts, after all, represent different approaches to the morning podcast news — Up First favors breadth and speed, exhibiting a purpose parallel to A.M. email news digests, while The Daily favors depth and experience, building a space that often feels remarkably close to magazine features — and even if you could construct the argument for one’s superiority, there is always the natural (though somewhat frustrating) meta-counter-argument that both models provide different kinds of value to different kinds of people’s needs and preferences. From here, the move should instead be to think of what they tell us as a collection; of what they tell us about where the genre is.\n\nFair enough, but I do think that The Daily is unambiguously superior to NPR’s offering on a number of levels where it counts — particularly in terms of the way it achieves what it has set out to do, and the way it has definitively furthered the experience of news consumption in the podcast format. To begin with, The Daily possesses a greater degree of inventiveness and generally makes much better use of the podcast format, resulting in a freshness that makes the prospect of listening to the news more attractive. It does this by being emotionally ambitious, which feels both rare and miles apart from another, more commonly deployed strategy to increase the appeal of news: by dumbing it down. Its choice to focus on a small number of deeply executed stories per day has allowed it to extract tremendous narrative value from depth, and it gives the show greater versatility in its ability to traffic both in headlines and features that seem to exist out of time; there is no greater example of this than last Friday’s gorgeous episode adapting a feature on assisted suicide in Canada.\n\nNevertheless, the places where The Daily is most dynamic also happen to be its sources of risk and potential weaknesses. And, interestingly enough, where Up First has chosen to be comparatively more conservative — only marginally innovating on the core sound or formula of NPR — also happens to be where it is at its most orthogonally competitive with The Daily. In its pursuit of emotional depth, The Daily is in a position that consistently runs the risk of stacking the deck too far in one direction, which may well open it up to critiques of myopia and manipulation. This manifests itself in the podcast’s use of music as something more than window dressing; it is, to use a cliché, a character of its own in the show that interacts with and augments the narrative, and it has the capacity to emotionally condition listeners in a way that some might consider ethically dubious. (No different, it could be argued, from the choice of photographs deployed within articles.)\n\nIt also manifests itself in the show’s choice to heavily tether its perspective on its host, Michael Barbaro, a move that highlights the trickiness of that emotional ambition (see that one episode about the coal miner, where your mileage may vary, or even roll backward). There also exists the question of how The Daily might function, or whether it can remain as strong, should Barbaro need to take a week off or, oh I don’t know, decide to work for WaPo or something. It’s a classic question of high-level media production: the choice between the vessel or the talent, and it is here that Up First’s more conservative choice to lean on the voice of the institution feels more solid. (Don’t believe in the king, NPR’s gambit seems to say, believe in the kingdom.)\n\nAt its core, I think the underlying story here is really one about experimentation in and the risk-reward profiles of large institutions. It’s been remarkable to watch these moves play out from these organizations, and I’m excited to see what happens next. Anyway, to state the blindingly obvious, this is merely my take on the matter — I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nPublic radio watch. (1) As expected, the Trump administration’s proposed budget for the 2018 fiscal year pushes for the closure of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the body that serves as a key layer of financial support for the country’s public broadcasting infrastructure. According to the draft, the CPB will receive about $30 million to “conduct an orderly closeout of federal funding.” Current has a good (paywalled) writeup on this, and for more information on the significance of such a closure, check out this Hot Pod issue from February. Keep in mind that this is merely a budget proposal — it requires congressional approval.\n\n(2) From a piece about WAMU, the Washington D.C.–based public radio station, by Washingtonian: “In 2014, about 45,000 weekly listeners were African-American and 49,000 Latino. By early this year, those audiences had leapt to about 106,000 apiece, almost a quarter of listeners. That’s far from reflecting the region as a whole, where blacks and Latinos account for about 40 percent of the population, but for a public radio station it’s unusual.” What accounts for the growth? NPR’s Sam Sanders:\n\nThe Washingtonian piece also contains an overview of the hires that contributed to the diversification of WAMU’s staff. (Hell yeah.)\n\n(3) David Eads, the outgoing senior supervising editor for NPR’s visuals team, posted a farewell note that’s equal parts critique, warning, and message of hope. He writes: “This is a historic moment for us. Huge swaths of print journalism are on life support. TV journalism is saturated with spectacle. A few dominant national news outlets continue to grow and attract investment along with a gaggle of digital newcomers who understand the power of the screen. Public media is actually doing OK. But history is going to catch up with us any minute if we don’t reinterpret the model with both care and speed.”\n\nPersonnel notes:\n\nCareer spotlight. Time for another chat about careers! If you need a quick reminder on the thinking behind this feature, go here. This week, I talked with Jonathan Mena of the Loud Speakers Network, who just wrapped up production on Mogul. The dude is super interesting, and his story is both remarkable and remarkably representative of a lot of career arcs I’ve seen in the space.\n\nMena: I started podcasting in 2006 around the time when iPods first started getting color screens and Twitter had just launched. I was in college editing lectures for the German department, which we would upload on iTunes University. I don’t speak any German so the professor would go through her lecture and tell me in English when to cut and start again. Around this time I was going to school for journalism and production and had a great professor and mentor named Gregg Morris. Morris made podcasting part of the curriculum and pushed us to produce our own shows. He’s really the first one who showed me there was more to journalism than being in front of a mic or camera. Back then, I never thought podcasting would be what it is now. Can you imagine a time before the podcast app where you had to physically download the podcast on your computer and transfer the file via cable to your device? I finished school and got a day job in IT but was still freelancing for a local blog covering the crime beat. It was around this time that Reggie Osse (aka Combat Jack) was doing internet radio and getting some big guests for a show only a few hundred people were listening to in New York. We all started following each other on Twitter and would see each other at events around the city. A year or so later they announced they were thinking of starting a podcast network. They didn’t even have a name at the time. I reached out to Chris Morrow, who eventually became a cofounder of LSN, to see if they needed any help. Morrow offered me a shot at editing a new podcast they were launching about sneakers. The show wound up having a short run of only a few months. A few weeks later out of the blue, I get an email from Reggie asking to edit a Combat Jack Show episode. He needed the episode turned around as soon as possible. Now I knew that email wasn’t for me and he had sent it by mistake, but I answered it anyway. I turned that episode around as fast as I could — two hours later he had the completed episode ready for posting. The next day Reggie invited me for coffee to talk about coming on the show as a producer, but never gave me a time or location. Two weeks go by and I never hear back from him or got any response from my follow up emails. Then one day he calls me and says, “We have Russell Simmons in the studio today, can you come by so we can talk about you joining the team?” Reggie later admitted he sent the email to me by mistake, but said it was meant to be.\n\nYou can find Mena on Twitter at @jonathanmena."],[8,"Harvard graduate turned Asia’s king of martial arts","Chatri Sityodtong survived on a diet of budget Korean buffets while an undergraduate at Harvard. Now, the protean martial arts expert, former internet entrepreneur and one-time hedge fund manager wants to create the biggest and most lucrative sporting spectacle in Asia, the world’s most populous region.\n\nThe glitzy One Championship mixed martial arts(MMA) competition, which 46-year-old Mr Chatri founded and heads, hit Singapore at the end of May and is due in Myanmar, Macau and Malaysia over the next few months. Mr Chatri, who was raised in Thailand, believes the championships have the potential to attract 2bn television viewers and sellout events in a different Asian city every weekend.\n\n“If you look at the history of sports in Asia, we’ve always only imported,” he says, pointing to the popularity of English football, US basketball and Formula One motor racing. “So I had a very simple thesis: I said, ‘Man, it’s time for Asia to have its own sports league — and Asia’s been the home of martial arts for 5,000 years.’”\n\nMr Chatri says five-year-old One Championship achieved record viewer figures for its show in Manila in April. But its finances remain closely guarded: he says only that the event is now “very, very close to profitability”, with revenues that are in “eight figures and growing very rapidly”. Investment in One exceeds $50m, and includes a stake bought last year for an undisclosed sum by Temasek, the Singapore state investment fund.\n\nJames Goyder, a journalist who has covered combat sports in Asia for a decade, says One has had to overcome a “lot of cynicism” from people who “expected it to fold after a couple of shows” like previous similar big ventures.\n\n“I think those people underestimated Chatri,” Mr Goyder says.\n\nOne Championship is the synthesis of Mr Chatri’s two long-time obsessions: martial arts and financial investment. He is a practitioner of Muay Thai — Thai boxing — and he took the name Sityodtong in honour of the master at whose training camp he studied.\n\nHis life changed when his “quite well-to-do” family in Bangkok lost everything in the financial crisis that affected Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries in the late 1990s.\n\nHe had a place at Harvard, but little money to live on. He recalls visiting an all-you-can-eat Korean buffet that cost “three dollars and change” and became “the big highlight of the day”. His mother even lived with him in his university dormitory because the family had lost their home.\n\nMr Chatri acknowledges that — for all the financial stress of that period — he still had the advantages of education and connections. He went on to study at Harvard Business School and to co-found an internet software start-up, which he later sold.\n\nHe then spent 10 years in the hedge fund industry but recalls finding the world of pure finance “empty”. He was ready to act on his insight about the gap in the market for big-money sports in Asia. “Every region of the world has several multi-billion-dollar sports properties entrenched in society and culture and tradition — and I see no difference here,” he says.\n\nMr Chatri presents One Championship as a “responsible” outfit, compared with western combat sports, whose “entire marketing platform is focused on glorifying the fights, the violence, the blood, the antagonism”.\n\nHe casts the event in a social role by featuring the “inspiring” life stories of fighters who have sometimes come from grinding poverty.\n\nPurses per fight range from $5,000 for an entry-level fighter to $300,000 or more for a top name — riches in a martial arts world full of stories of fighters being exploited by unscrupulous promoters. He says most events have been sell-outs or close to full in stadiums with capacities typically between 5,000 and 20,000.\n\nMr Chatri says One Championship is made for changing sports viewing habits as fans have moved away from television and on to smartphones. “No one is going to watch a 90-minute soccer game on their mobile device,” he says. “But our contact is three [five-minute] rounds per fight and 80 per cent of our fights end before that, through either a knockout or submission, a finish.”\n\nNevertheless, television is still part of One’s strategy. It broadcasts via a mix of free-to-air television, cable and $9.99 event livestreams. The company says it now has a broadcast footprint in 118 countries with a potential 1bn viewers, while its social media video views have grown from 312,000 in 2014 to a projected 314m in 2017, based on company forecasts from data gathered by Nielsen, Facebook and Repucom.\n\nThe company already bills itself as the largest sports media property in Asia and aims to build revenues further through brand licensing, among other means, for products such as protein shakes and video games, Mr Chatri says.\n\nIt is too early to judge if Mr Chatri will hit his target of listing the company in New York or Hong Kong. But he reckons he has already proved his central idea that Asian audiences will flock to see performers of Asian heritage do battle in Asia.\n\n“I’ll just say it’s tribal,” he says. “People want to root for people who look like them, eat like them, think like them, live life like them — and that’s resonating.”"],[8,"21 'critical' after van and stabbing attack","NHS England has said 21 people are in a critical condition following Saturday night's terror attack in Central London.\n\nSeven people were killed after three male attackers drove a white Renault hire van into crowds on London Bridge before stabbing people near Borough Market.\n\nSix of those who lost their lives were pronounced dead at the scene.

Riders can choose from pre-set tip amounts (in dollars) or input a custom value. All of that money will go to the driver. Tips will be available on all trips in the US by the end of July.\n\n“You told us what you want and it’s time we step up and give you the driving experience you deserve, because simply put, Uber wouldn’t exist without you,” Uber said on a new webpage announcing that and other changes designed to benefit drivers, a campaign it’s branding, “180 Days of Change.”\n\nThe decision to add a tipping option is a huge change of heart for Uber. Drivers have clamored for a tipping option for years, but the company has historically said tipping is not part of the Uber experience. Uber’s reasoning in the past has included, “Uber is a cashless experience” (still the official policy on Uber’s online help site) and “tipping is tacky.” Before he resigned, Uber’s then-ridesharing president Jeff Jones continued to push the company line, telling drivers in a Q&A on Facebook in February that satisfied riders could leave a “compliment” but not a tip.\n\nUber’s pivot comes exactly one week after Travis Kalanick said he would take an indefinite leave of absence from his role as chief executive. Kalanick was known within Uber for vehemently opposing tipping, believing it was part of what made taxi rides such a bad experience, several people familiar with the matter told Quartz.\n\nUber declined to comment specifically on what led to the reversal on tipping, pointing instead to its online announcement. Among other changes announced today, drivers will start getting paid a metered rate after two minutes of waiting for their passenger (extending a policy Uber debuted last year) and riders will be charged a $5 fee for cancelling two minutes after booking a trip, down from five.\n\nBut let’s get back to tipping. For all that drivers have requested it, tipping is hardly a best practice in labor. Tipping—and the tipped minimum wage—is, as Slate once eloquently said, an abomination. It doesn’t incentivize hard work, rarely correlates with quality of service, and is a racially charged minefield. Celebrity restaurateur Danny Meyer is famed for, among other things, debuting a no-tipping policy at The Modern, a pricey dining spot in midtown Manhattan, because it was the “right thing” to do.\n\nThat said, tipping is also ubiquitous within the for-hire rides industry. Taxis have them, as do ride-hailing competitors like Lyft and Juno. Lyft said last week that drivers had earned $250 million in tips since it was founded in 2012. That means Uber drivers who don’t have the opportunity to earn tips are at a disadvantage unless Uber pays them higher rates, which it doesn’t. Instead, Uber has repeatedly slashed its fares to boost demand from riders, forcing drivers to work harder to earn the same amount.\n\nIn New York City, the Independent Drivers Guild, a non-union group that represents professional drivers, had campaigned to have all ride-hailing companies be required to include a tipping option in their app. The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, the local taxi regulator, said in mid-April that it would sketch out rules on tipping by July.\n\n“Today’s tipping announcement is an important win for drivers and proves that thousands of drivers coming together with one voice can make big changes,” IDG founder Jim Conigliaro Jr. said in a statement. “Cuts to driver pay across the ride-hail industry have made tipping income more important than ever.”"],[8,"The Dutch Have Solutions to Rising Seas. The World Is Watching.","ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands — The wind over the canal stirred up whitecaps and rattled cafe umbrellas. Rowers strained toward a finish line and spectators hugged the shore. Henk Ovink, hawkish, wiry, head shaved, watched from a V.I.P. deck, one eye on the boats, the other, as usual, on his phone.\n\nMr. Ovink is the country’s globe-trotting salesman in chief for Dutch expertise on rising water and climate change. Like cheese in France or cars in Germany, climate change is a business in the Netherlands. Month in, month out, delegations from as far away as Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, New York and New Orleans make the rounds in the port city of Rotterdam. They often end up hiring Dutch firms, which dominate the global market in high-tech engineering and water management.\n\nThat’s because from the first moment settlers in this small nation started pumping water to clear land for farms and houses, water has been the central, existential fact of life in the Netherlands, a daily matter of survival and national identity. No place in Europe is under greater threat than this waterlogged country on the edge of the Continent. Much of the nation sits below sea level and is gradually sinking. Now climate change brings the prospect of rising tides and fiercer storms.\n\nFrom a Dutch mind-set, climate change is not a hypothetical or a drag on the economy, but an opportunity. While the Trump administration withdraws from the Paris accord, the Dutch are pioneering a singular way forward.\n\nIt is, in essence, to let water in, where possible, not hope to subdue Mother Nature: to live with the water, rather than struggle to defeat it. The Dutch devise lakes, garages, parks and plazas that are a boon to daily life but also double as enormous reservoirs for when the seas and rivers spill over. You may wish to pretend that rising seas are a hoax perpetrated by scientists and a gullible news media. Or you can build barriers galore. But in the end, neither will provide adequate defense, the Dutch say.\n\nAnd what holds true for managing climate change applies to the social fabric, too. Environmental and social resilience should go hand in hand, officials here believe, improving neighborhoods, spreading equity and taming water during catastrophes. Climate adaptation, if addressed head-on and properly, ought to yield a stronger, richer state.\n\nThis is the message the Dutch have been taking out into the world. Dutch consultants advising the Bangladeshi authorities about emergency shelters and evacuation routes recently helped reduce the numbers of deaths suffered in recent floods to “hundreds instead of thousands,” according to Mr. Ovink.\n\n“That’s what we’re trying to do,” he said. “You can say we are marketing our expertise, but thousands of people die every year because of rising water, and the world is failing collectively to deal with the crisis, losing money and lives.” He ticks off the latest findings: 2016 was the warmest year on record; global sea levels rose to new highs.\n\nHe proudly shows off the new rowing course just outside Rotterdam, where the World Rowing Championships were staged last summer. The course forms part of an area called the Eendragtspolder, a 22-acre patchwork of reclaimed fields and canals — a prime example of a site built as a public amenity that collects floodwater in emergencies. It is near the lowest point in the Netherlands, about 20 feet below sea level. With its bike paths and water sports, the Eendragtspolder has become a popular retreat. Now it also serves as a reservoir for the Rotte River Basin when the nearby Rhine overflows, which, because of climate change, it’s expected to do every decade.\n\nThe project is among dozens in a nationwide program, years in the making, called Room for the River, which overturned centuries-old strategies of seizing territory from rivers and canals to build dams and dikes. The Netherlands effectively occupies the gutter of Europe, a lowlands bounded on one end by the North Sea, into which immense rivers like the Rhine and the Meuse flow from Germany, Belgium and France. Dutch thinking changed after floods forced hundreds of thousands to evacuate during the 1990s. The floods “were a wake-up call to give back to the rivers some of the room we had taken,” as Harold van Waveren, a senior government adviser, recently explained.\n\n“We can’t just keep building higher levees, because we will end up living behind 10-meter walls,” he said. “We need to give the rivers more places to flow. Protection against climate change is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain, and the chain in our case includes not just the big gates and dams at the sea but a whole philosophy of spatial planning, crisis management, children’s education, online apps and public spaces.”\n\nMr. van Waveren was talking about a national GPS-guided app created so that residents always know exactly how far below sea level they are. To use public pools unrestricted, Dutch children must first earn diplomas that require swimming in their clothes and shoes. “It’s a basic part of our culture, like riding a bike,” Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch architect, told me.\n\nIn the Netherlands, scholarly articles about changes to the Arctic ice cap make front-page headlines. Long before climate change deniers began to campaign against science in the United States, Dutch engineers were preparing for apocalyptic, once-every-10,000-years storms. “For us, climate change is beyond ideology,” said Rotterdam’s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb. He took me one morning around new waterfront development in a formerly poor, industrial neighborhood, to show how urban renewal dovetails with strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\n“If there is a shooting in a bar, I am asked a million questions,” Mr. Aboutaleb said of his city. “But if I say everyone should own a boat because we predict a tremendous increase in the intensity of rain, nobody questions the politics. Rotterdam lies in the most vulnerable part of the Netherlands, both economically and geographically. If the water comes in, from the rivers or the sea, we can evacuate maybe 15 out of 100 people. So evacuation isn’t an option. We can escape only into high buildings. We have no choice. We must learn to live with water.”\n\nA Moroccan-born Muslim and a rising star in the Dutch political world who denounces religious radicals and reactionary nationalists alike, the mayor runs a traditionally tough, working-class city. Rotterdam today is anything but a paradise. It is riven by social fissures and discord over immigration. But it has begun to improve in recent years as it has become greener and more diverse. When asked about climate threats, the mayor talks about creating a less divided, more attractive, healthier city — more capable of facing the stresses climate change imposes on society.\n\n“That’s just common sense,” Mr. Aboutaleb said. The Eendragtspolder is one example, he pointed out, repaying Rotterdam’s investment with green spaces and the rowing course, which has the added perk of aiding a prospective Dutch bid for the 2028 Olympics.\n\nLeveled by bombs during World War II, Rotterdam is not quaint and touristic like Amsterdam but industrial, down to earth, a surprisingly stylish sleeper among Europe’s cultural hubs, with a legacy of radical architecture, attracting young designers and entrepreneurs. Its tradition of openness has made it a magnet for outsiders and helped it recover from years of hardship, when, during the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, it became notoriously crime-ridden and filthy, a place wealthy people fled.\n\nLately the city, accustomed to starting over, has reinvented itself as a capital of enterprise and environmental ingenuity. It has pioneered the construction of facilities like those parking garages that become emergency reservoirs, ensuring that the city can prevent sewage overflow from storms now predicted to happen every five or 10 years. It has installed plazas with fountains, gardens and basketball courts in underserved neighborhoods that can act as retention ponds. It has reimagined its harbors and stretches of its formerly industrial waterfront as incubators for new businesses, schools, housing and parks.\n\nThese are all stops on the standard tour for visiting foreign delegations: proof-of-concept urban interventions, if not actually all-encompassing solutions, that address climate threats in ways that incrementally serve the economy and social needs.\n\n“A smart city has to have a comprehensive, holistic vision beyond levees and gates,” as Arnoud Molenaar, the city’s climate chief, put it. “The challenge of climate adaptation is to include safety, sewers, housing, roads, emergency services. You need public awareness. You also need cyber-resilience, because the next challenge in climate safety is cybersafety. You can’t have vulnerable systems that control your sea gates and bridges and sewers. And you need good policies, big and small.\n\n“This starts with little things, like getting people to remove the concrete pavement from their gardens so the soil underneath absorbs rainwater,” Mr. Molenaar said. “It ends with the giant storm surge barrier at the North Sea.”\n\nThat would be the Maeslantkering, built near the mouth of the sea, about a half-hour drive west from downtown Rotterdam — the city’s first line of defense. It is the size of two tubular Eiffel Towers, toppled over.\n\nIn the 20 years since it opened, the Maeslantkering hasn’t actually been needed to prevent a flood, but it is tested regularly just in case. Picnickers line the shore to watch. The trial closings are a little like the Dutch version of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nI drove with Mr. van Waveren to see it one day. It is not uncommon here to witness the astonishing sight of ships cruising by overhead. This happens in a country where the highways are frequently below sea level.\n\nThe Maeslantkering is a consequence of repeated historic calamities. In 1916, the North Sea overwhelmed the Dutch coastline, inaugurating a spate of protective construction that failed to hold back the water in 1953 when an overnight storm killed more than 1,800 people. The Dutch still call it the Disaster. They redoubled national efforts, inaugurating the Delta Works project that dammed two major waterways and produced the Maeslantkering — the giant sea gate, completed in 1997, keeping open the immense waterway that services the entire port of Rotterdam.\n\nProtecting the port is paramount. Once the world’s busiest, Rotterdam’s port remains the most important in Europe, each year serving tens of thousands of ships from around the world, supplying steel to Germany, petrochemicals to South America and pretty much everything else to everywhere. The port is still the bedrock industry in this city of more than 600,000, according to port officials, accounting for 90,000 jobs, not to mention another 90,000 workers whose businesses depend on the port, too.\n\nThe port supports five oil refineries, whose owners include Shell and the Koch brothers, along with a massive coal-fire power plant. Officials say the port accounts for 17 percent of the entire nation’s carbon footprint. A central paradox — and to skeptics, the ultimate hypocrisy — of this city’s environmental self-branding is that, at heart, Rotterdam’s economy continues to rely on the fossil fuel industry.\n\nHow the port eventually transitions to a greener economy, authorities concede, is the greatest challenge they face, along with climate change. They describe plans for immense wind farms in the North Sea and strategies to capture heat from fuel-burning factories to warm the greenhouses that supply the country’s agricultural yield. The Netherlands exports nearly $100 billion a year in agricultural products, second only to the United States.\n\nIn any case, the safe transport of all those raw materials, not to mention the responsibility of keeping the feet of people in the city dry, now and in the future, depends on the Maeslantkering.\n\nThe idea behind it, first discussed decades ago, was unprecedented — a monumental gate with two arms, resting on either side of the canal, each arm as tall and twice as heavy as the Eiffel Tower. It was a staggering work of engineering. Wim Quist, the architect, devised an object of surpassing beauty, one of modern Europe’s lesser-known marvels.\n\nMr. van Waveren described how it works. When the gate is closed, the arms float out onto the canal, meet and lock, the tubes filling with water and sinking onto a concrete bed, making an impenetrable steel wall against the North Sea. The process takes two and a half hours. Pressure from the sea is then transferred from the wall to the largest ball joints in the world, embedded in the banks on either side of the river.\n\nComputers, using a closed electronic system to avoid cyberattack, monitor sea levels hourly and can shut the gate automatically — or open it. This is critical: Thirty pumps inside the gate are linked to one of the country’s power grids. They extract water from the tubes when it is time for the Maeslantkering to be reopened.\n\nIf the grid fails, there is a backup grid and, as a last resort, a generator, because even more dangerous than the gate’s not closing is the gate’s not reopening. In that case, water pouring down from the Rhine and Meuse rivers could not flow into the sea and would overwhelm Rotterdam even more swiftly than the North Sea could. As Mr. Aboutaleb noted, escape would be impossible.\n\nMr. Ovink said only half-jokingly, “the last resort would be to blow it up.” The Maeslantkering was clearly built with Hollywood disaster-movie scenarios in mind: There are redundancies to redundancies, and the barrier is prepared for the most extreme climate change models, with sea levels rising beyond current forecasts.\n\nEven so, Rotterdam port officials have plans underway to add another two feet to the height of the gate.\n\nBeyond the Maeslantkering, back in town, there are countless fortifications, big and small, knitted into streets and squares. One sunny afternoon, I met Wynand Dassen, manager of Rotterdam’s resilience team, and Paul van Roosmalen, who oversees rooftop development for the city, at the Dakpark, a dike in a poor, largely immigrant neighborhood bordering industrial waterfront. The site of the Dakpark used to be a railway switching station, a grim nowhere place abutting a cluster of social housing blocks. This was a red-light district, notorious for drug dealers and crime.\n\nThe dike does a lot more than just hold back water. It has a shopping center, which the neighborhood needed, and a park on the roof. Shops face the waterfront and help pay to keep up the park. The park slopes from the roof down to streets and housing blocks, creating a grassy hill that links park and neighborhood.\n\nWhen the weather is good, sunbathers sprawl on the grassy roof and toss Frisbees. Formal gardens open onto acres of well-kept lawns. The park is a kilometer long. And wonderful. Its success — not only as a barrier but also as a boon to business and the area — has persuaded officials to consult neighborhoods and set aside money for community-initiated projects. “We became invested in getting more people involved in all kinds of civic issues,” Mr. Dassen told me, “and water inevitably becomes an integral part of this process. We believe you get the smartest solutions when communities are engaged and help make the links between water and neighborhood development.”\n\nMr. van Roosmalen agreed. “It’s an example of what you can do if you connect storm-water management with social welfare and neighborhood improvements,” he said. “It’s what we mean here in Rotterdam by ‘resilience planning.’”\n\nIn a neighborhood nearby, where drug addicts used to trek all the way from France to buy cheap heroin, I came across Marleen ten Vergert, a single parent supporting a young daughter on a civil servant’s modest salary. Women in hijabs lugged groceries, old men lounged on park benches and children rode skateboards over broken concrete paths, past aged housing blocks. One block of houses surrounded a water plaza created to capture floodwater. Young families were enticed by prices of a single euro to buy abandoned houses around it. Many families came and went. The water park was vandalized. But, slowly, little by little, it has come to be embraced by the neighborhood.\n\n“Now, for the most part, it works,” Ms. Vergert told me. “People want the water square, so they take better care of it. There’s a greenhouse nearby run by a Turkish community. The value of houses in the neighborhood has gone up.”\n\nA few blocks away, a start-up in a converted industrial waterfront building is developing solar-powered sailing drones for collecting plastic trash from the sea, and, back in the middle of the city, a warehouse with a Brooklynesque mix of artisanal food stalls, a circus academy and a pinball museum has rejuvenated a formerly dingy pier. Where the old Hotel New York, a century-old landmark, used to be the tallest building along a stretch of waterfront, skyscrapers have sprung up, producing a whole new business district in Rotterdam, with a photography museum across the street from the city’s signature office tower, De Rotterdam, by Mr. Koolhaas, and Ben van Berkel’s harplike Erasmus Bridge.\n\nRotterdam is clearly trying to cast itself as a model of inventive urbanism. A local businessman, Peter van Wingerden, envisions floating dairy farms along the waterfront. One in every three trucks coming into the city carries food, he said. Floating farms would reduce truck traffic and carbon emissions, supplying the city with its own milk. With the city’s encouragement, he is constructing a $2.2 million prototype, for 40 cows, producing a half-million liters (about 130,000 gallons) of milk a year. “The river is no longer just for industry,” he told me. “We need to find new uses, which keep us safe from climate change, and help the city grow and prosper.”\n\nThat’s the city’s mantra. When I asked Mr. van Wingerden if it was unsettling to live in a waterfront city mostly below sea level, he said: “It seems to us less dangerous than living on the San Andreas Fault. At least when we flood, we’ll have some warning before our feet get wet.”\n\nTo the Dutch, what’s truly incomprehensible, he added, is New York after Hurricane Sandy, where too little has been done to prepare for the next disaster. People in the Netherlands believe that the places with the most people and the most to lose economically should get the most protection.\n\nThe idea that a global economic hub like Lower Manhattan flooded during Hurricane Sandy, costing the public billions of dollars, yet still has so few protections, leaves climate experts here dumbfounded.\n\nMr. Molenaar, Rotterdam’s climate chief, summed up the Dutch view: “We have been able to put climate change adaptation high on the public agenda without suffering a disaster in many years because we have shown the benefits of improving public space — the added economic value of investing in resilience.\n\n“It’s in our genes,” he said. “Water managers were the first rulers of the land. Designing the city to deal with water was the first task of survival here and it remains our defining job. It’s a process, a movement.\n\n“It is not just a bunch of dikes and dams, but a way of life.”"],[8,"Revolutionary Guards blame Saudi Arabia for Tehran terror attack","Iran’s Revolutionary Guards ratcheted up the tensions with Saudi Arabia as it accused Tehran’s regional rival of involvement in Wednesday’s double terrorist attack in the capital, which left at least 13 people dead and wounded more than 50.\n\nGunmen and suicide bombers launched simultaneous attacks on the parliament building in Tehran and the nearby shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic’s founder.\n\nThe attacks were claimed by Isis, in what would be the jihadi group’s first significant strike in the Islamic Republic. However a statement from the Revolutionary Guards linked the “brutal attack” to Donald Trump’s visit last month to Riyadh, where the US president singled out Iran for fuelling “the fires of sectarian conflict and terror”.\n\n“This terrorist act took place a week after a joint meeting between the US president and head of a reactionary regional country [Saudi Arabia] which has been a constant supporter of terrorism,” the statement said. “The fact Isis claimed responsibility proves that they [Saudi Arabia] were involved in the brutal attack.”\n\nSpeaking in Berlin, Adel Al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, denied the accusation of involvement and said there was no evidence that his country was involved. “We condemn terrorist attacks anywhere they occur and we condemn the killing of the innocent anywhere it occurs,” Mr al-Jubeir was quoted by Reuters as saying.\n\nHassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, condemned the attacks, without laying the blame at the feet of Saudi Arabia. However, the accusation from the powerful Revolutionary Guards will stoke the increasingly bitter enmity between Tehran and Riyadh, which are involved in proxy wars from Syria to Yemen.\n\nIran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tweeted, “Terror-sponsoring despots threaten to bring the fight to our homeland. Proxies attack what their masters despise most: the seat of democracy.”\n\nMr Zarif seemed to be pointing at a comment last month by the Saudi deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman that any struggle for influence between Riyadh and Tehran would take place “inside Iran, not in Saudi Arabia”.\n\n“We know that the aim of the Iranian regime is to reach the focal point of Muslims [Mecca] and we will not wait until the fight is inside Saudi Arabia and we will work so that the battle is on their side, inside Iran, not in Saudi Arabia,” Prince Mohammed said in a television interview.\n\nThe attacks also come at a sensitive moment in the Gulf, where a new rift opened this week pitting Qatar, with whom Tehran has ties, against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain. The quartet on Monday severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and accused Doha of supporting terrorism.\n\nHamid-Reza Taraghi, a senior politician close to Tehran’s hardliners, blamed a combination of Saudi Arabia, the US, Isis and the exiled opposition group MEK for Wednesday’s attacks. “Saudi Arabia is definitely playing the leading role in these incidents, considering that its foreign ministry threatened Iran two to three days ago,” he said, referring to a call by Riyadh for Iran to be punished for supporting terrorism. He provided no evidence to support his claims.\n\nHis view was echoed by others, though they did not provide evidence either. “The fact that these two attacks took place . . . after that [Riyadh] meeting means that both the US and the Saudi regime have ordered their proxies to embark on that act,” Brigadier-General Hossein Nejat of the Revolutionary Guards told a local news agency.\n\nMohsen Rezaei, a former Revolutionary Guards commander, warned terrorists to expect a “tough and unforgettable” response from Iran.\n\nMr Trump’s administration is viewed as much more hawkish on Iran than the previous government of Barack Obama. Tehran has long accused Saudi Arabia of supporting Isis.\n\nThe assault began at 10.30am local time when three gunmen (earlier reports had said four) in women’s clothing walked into the building and began shooting. One detonated an explosive vest. All the attackers were killed after a stand-off lasting several hours, Iran’s interior ministry said.\n\nTwo further gunmen also opened fire at the Ayatollah Khomeini shrine in the Iranian capital. One was reported to have killed himself by detonating an explosive vest. Another was shot dead. Based on a video released by Isis, the attackers spoke Arabic. Brigadier-General Nejat said the nationality of the attackers was not yet clear, but an Iranian official told state television on Wednesday night that they were Iranian.\n\nAt least 13 people were killed in the two attacks, Pir-Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran’s emergency department, was quoted as saying by the official Irna news agency on Thursday.\n\nIsis on Wednesday vowed further attacks on Iran, saying “Persia should know that the state of the caliphate will not miss an opportunity for an onslaught against them”.\n\nIranian officials said security forces remained on high alert.\n\nTerrorist attacks are rare in Iran, which keeps a tight grip on domestic security. The country has largely been spared from militant attacks despite its heavy support of Shia militias in Syria and Iraq, which has increased sympathies among some of those countries’ Sunni populations for radical groups such as Isis.\n\nIf Iran steps up its fight against Isis in the wake of Wednesday’s attack, the situation in the region could become even more volatile, analysts say. Charlie Winter, senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, said the attack could boost Isis’s flagging morale and intensify pressure on Tehran to step up its involvement in Syria against the jihadis. “If this happens, a more intense ‘Sunni war against Shia Islam’ will pour petrol on Isis’s ideological fire,” he said.\n\nSecurity analysts outside of Iran have long argued that it has not been attacked because it tolerated the presence of al-Qaeda and the movement of communications and finances through the country. But for Isis, which is not reliant on foreign financing, Iran has long been a target.\n\nWhile it is difficult to gauge the extent of an Isis presence in Iran, the group has long sought to attract people from Iran’s Sunni minority. Last March, it released a 36-minute video in Persian, vowing to conquer Iran. In the video, militants used photographs of Iranian leaders for target practice, including Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds force."],[8,"Queen’s Speech 2017: what it means for you","This Queen’s Speech is about recognising and grasping the opportunities that lie ahead for the United Kingdom as we leave the European Union:\n\n27 Bills and draft Bills are being announced today in a legislative programme, which will deliver on these themes.\n\nFollowing on from the 2016 referendum, the government will bring forward legislation to deliver on the will of the British people and ensure a smooth and orderly withdrawal from the EU.\n\nThis Bill will allow for a smooth and orderly transition as the UK leaves the EU, ensuring that, wherever practical, the same rules and laws apply after exit and therefore maximising certainty for individuals and businesses.

It is a gruesome monument to the naked greed, short-sightedness, and corruption of the capitalist system, shown by the criminal shortcomings of the council and their contractors.\n\nThe Grenfell tower was built in the 1970s as one of a collection of grey and mundane council blocks that were so popular with councils in that period, seen as a quick way to resolve Britain’s housing problems. Not only popular with councils, they were also popular with British construction companies, who saw a quick buck to be made selling system-built prefabricated concrete boxes for the poor.\n\nNumerous housing companies cropped up on the market. All of them had in common a desire for a quick financial turnaround, with scant regard for either the environment or social issues that these monstrous estates created.\n\nAmongst these was the notorious Taylor Woodrow “Anglian” system-built housing that was used on Ronan Point, which collapsed on 16 May 1968, killing four and injuring 17 others. The subsequent inquiry into Ronan Point found that the building was unsafe; that it had not been designed for expected wind loadings and would not be able to withstand even small explosions or fire damage.\n\nStories abound about shoddy work practises and the social problems created by these places, and by the 1990s tenants in these monsters were demanding either radical refurbishments or demolition; and not a few disappeared, with low-rise housing replacing them.\n\nBoth under Thatcher and Tony Blair, however, a new ethos arose that worshiped the middle class and big business. A demonisation of the working class was launched by the ruling class, determined to retrench their wealth; to try and shore up their decaying social system and denigrate the working class.\n\nNot a few council estates have disappeared completely under the aegis of “regeneration”, only to be replaced by luxury flats – “affordable homes”…for the rich, opening up possibilities for speculators.\n\nThis is where the Grenfell tower disaster comes in.\n\nNorth Kensington is undergoing a similar regeneration, with new homes for the rich being put up.  The Grenfell tower didn’t look right and didn’t fit in to the area’s new image, so the Kensington Council decided to spend £10 million giving the tower a makeover.\n\nThe council and its contractor Rydon decided to use a panelling called Reynobond PE (polyethylene) to clad the building. According to a Reuters report online, “The manufacturer of the panels used to clad the London tower block…advised customers against using its polyethylene-cored tiles - the ones reportedly used at Grenfell Tower - in high rise buildings.”\n\nThe Reuters article continues:\n\nAnother aspect of the installation of cladding on the outside of building is the existence of a gap between the cladding and the structure, which can act as a furnace chimney, funnelling a fire upwards very quickly.\n\nBoth the speed that the fire spread through Grenfell Tower and photographs of the intensity of the fire – showing white flames sweeping up the building – testify fully to just how highly dangerous this cladding is. It raises serious question as to the sanity of the authorities who sanctioned the use of the stuff on a tower block, even although they were aware that it was completely unsuitable for use in such circumstances.\n\nNo doubt, a key factor in their calculation was that it is cheap. And yet the above report indicates that the fire resistant option was only £2 per square metre more expensive – an estimated total additional cost of only around £6,000.\n\nGiven that there was a previous fire in a social housing tower in Camberwell, South London, back in 2009 where six people died, why didn’t Kensington Housing ALMO seriously consider the recommendation that came out from the public enquiry into that disaster: the need for a functioning fire alarm system and the installation of a fire sprinkler system as part of the refurbishment of the building. Surely a part of the £10 million bill could have been earmarked for this important improvement? And why haven’t the Tory government in Westminster pushed for this as a requirement?\n\nMaybe the corrupt mafia that is the Kensington & Chelsea Tory council and their agents think sprucing the building up on the outside was much more important than looking after the safety of tenants entrusted into their care.\n\nA look on the Rydon website today shows two other high-rise refurbishments to their credit: the Chalcot Estate in Camden and Ferrier Point in Canning Town, Newham.\n\nIn response to the criminal Grenfell scandal, Camden Council have confirmed that they are already now stripping away cladding on towers suspected to be at risk. With up to 600 tower blocks across the country now estimated to use similar below-standard panels, it is likely that many other council will have to follow suit.\n\nThe labour movement needs to demand a full inquiry into this disaster and into the safety of other refurbished blocks. We need to open up the books, not just at Kensington council, but others too, and make these accounts available for scrutiny by representatives from the labour movement and tenant organisations.\n\nThose responsible for this horrific event must answer for and pay for their misdeeds. For too long there has been a cosy arrangement behind closed doors between the building industry, local authorities, and central government. The time has come to open the doors wide on these shadowy corridors and bring forth the light.\n\nBy a Coventry reader of Socialist Appeal\n\nThe tragic but avoidable deaths in Grenfell Tower in London have focussed the minds of some on what could happen in the approximately 4,000 tower blocks scattered across Britain. As I write, it has been revealed that 600 buildings could have similar issues and inspections are underway. But as many of those affected directly and indirectly by the Grenfell Tower fire have said, it is too little too late.\n\nAnd it is not as if those in authority had not been warned.On 14th June the Guardian reportedthe words of architect and fire expert Sam Webb who had surveyed hundreds of residential tower blocks in the early 1990s and had presented his report to the Home Office. “A disaster waiting to happen,” he says. “We are still wrapping post-war high-rise buildings in highly flammable materials and leaving them without sprinkler systems installed, then being surprised when they burn down.” Not only did more than half the buildings surveyed not meet basic fire safety standards but also, “We discovered a widespread breach of safety, but we were simply told nothing could be done because it would ‘make too many people homeless’.”\n\nIn the same Guardian article Dr Jim Glocking, technical director of the Fire Protection Association (FPA), asserts that our standards need a fundamental overhaul. He says he has been campaigning for years to see fire safety standards improved, to no avail. He states, “It’s a tragedy that long-awaited changes to regulations usually only happen after significant loss of life.” And the lives lost are those of working class people!\n\nWe may never know the true figure of the number who died. For the past few days the media has spoken and written of 79 (and it is worth repeating) “needless deaths”, but the real figure could be closer to 150. Why? There are scores unaccounted for. Visitors to the block were not recorded. And there is the issue of multi-occupancy and subletting given the housing shortage crisis in Britain (and especially in London).\n\nThese events are of personal significance to me. I live in the top quarter of a tower block of 16 floors. Grenfell Tower had 24 floors, but there are similarities in my block with Grenfell Tower:\n\nThere are allegations of subletting, where official tenants move to another city for work or for relationships, but do not know how long they will be away and, given the chronic housing shortage, do not want to relinquish a more secure tenancy than what can be had in the private housing sector. So who lives in the block? We don’t know. Our block was refurbished about 14 months ago just like Grenfell Tower. The work was supposed to take nine months but took 18. And cladding was added to make the flats better insulated and easier on the eye. We have been assured by the West Mercia Housing Group that the cladding is far safer that at Grenfell Tower. We don’t know. New doors and windows to the wrap-around balcony were installed but they are noisier, colder and draughtier than the ones taken out. With such draughts coming in, the claim that a fire in any flat will be contained for a “safe” period to allow tenants to escape is a hollow claim as incoming air will feed the fire. In addition to the in draughts from the balcony door and windows there is also an in- draught from the pantry area. That means that the smoke from any fire below me will soon fill my flat leading to potential asphyxiation. There have been numerous complaints from tenants to the management organisation about health and safety issues – and all have been ignored. The week after the Grenfell Tower disaster, fire notices about evacuation procedures appeared on the ground floor in my block. And in the same week workers arrived to dig trenches to install lighting in the car park, as cables to the original lighting had been severed over a year ago during the refurbishment. For over a year health and safety issues were ignored, despite complaints. All of the council house stock in Coventry was once owned and managed by Coventry City Council. In December 2000 some 58.56% of existing council tenants took part in a ballot to transfer control to a management organisation called Whitefriars Housing, which became part of West Mercia Housing in 2008. 6,315 tenants voted to transfer and 5,220 voted to stay with the Council. If you take into account those who did not vote, the percentage of tenants voting to transfer was 31.8% (6,315 tenants out of more than 20,000) and the transfer took place. As in London, management of the council housing stock was effectively outsourced to a “not for profit organisation” that employs a number of people, and those at the top earn a very good salary. How much certain employees earn we do not know as the Freedom of Information Act only applies to public bodies and Whitefriars is not a public body. It is therefore a closed book to tenants. When the transfer took place in 2000, tenants were allowed to elect four representatives to sit on the Whitefriars board of management. About three years ago the elections for tenants reps were abolished by Whitefriars, with the support of the then right-wing controlled Labour Council, as elections were too expensive (!) and the reps did not have, according to Whitefriars, the skills they were looking for!! As in Grenfell Tower the tenants became voiceless. We used to have regular meetings in our block between tenants and management representatives. They were also abolished a few years ago as at each meeting there was criticism of management. So management wanted to ensure that tenants’ “voices were not heard”. There is a feeling of apathy in the block as any complaints that are made by individuals are ignored by management, so fewer complaints are now made with the general feeling being “what is the point?” The fire and deaths at Grenfell Tower may wake many of the tenants up. However, as in London, there are tenants here who were previously refugees or asylum seekers or simply homeless and it often happens that when you are homeless and/or in need of refuge, the last thing you do is make complaints.\n\nSo where do we go from here? What demands do we make to make sure that those who manage the blocks are accountable? Where is the democracy for tenants? After all, our lives may be at stake!\n\nAll management organisations of council/social housing stock should open their books so we as tenants who pay the rent can see where the money goes and who is paid what. One of the complaints made by tenants in Grenfell Tower was where did the £10m refurbishment costs go, especially as reports suggest that inferior materials were used. All social housing that has been outsourced to “not for profit” organisations should be brought back into council control so that the democratic element of regular local council elections can be used to make council housing departments accountable to the electorate. We as Whitefriars tenants cannot elect our reps, but strangely too no-one elects the Board of Management of Whitefriars. Apart from the four city councillors appointed to the management board by the City Council, all the other Board members are self appointed. Each block in the city should have a tenants’ committee that meets regularly, is funded and can produce a regular bulletin/newsletter as the mouthpiece of the tenants. At the moment all we get is a “regular” management newssheet that tells the tenants how well the management is doing. The Board of Management of council/social housing in each area should be made up of elected tenant representatives, the trade unions that organise the workers in the management organisations and the city council. Perhaps then we will have democracy and accountability in how council/social housing is provided and managed. At local, regional and national level there should be committees comprising tenants, the fire and rescue services, trade unions from the building industry, councillors and MPs to completely overhaul the regulations governing building standards in all buildings. It is now being reported that similar problems to Grenfell Tower could affect schools, hospitals and even some hotels. Finally, what happened in Grenfell Tower is intimately related to the housing crisis and the desperate shortage of truly affordable homes for rent, not the £400,000 homes that Cameron once claimed were affordable. Families with children should not be forced to live in tower blocks. We therefore need a massive home building programme of houses and flats. But how are we to achieve that? In our present system homes are built for profit. If no profit can be made from building homes for rent, they will not be built. To build homes we need land, finance, materials and skilled labour. Who owns the land? Who owns and controls the finance? Who owns the brick works, the cement factories, the glass and PVC works? Where is the skilled labour going to come from when funding to further education colleges, where building workers used to be trained, has been cut to the bone and courses closed? There is a dire shortage of skilled building workers. Why is it that between £50-80bn can be found for prestige projects such as HS2 but we cannot find the money to provide one of the most basic needs of human beings: a home? If all of the privately-owned resources needed to build homes cannot cooperate and coordinate their activities to solve the basic need of decent homes for all, then in the Labour Party and the trade unions we have to raise the issue of taking into public ownership land, finance and building resources, and for these to be managed under an agreed system of democratic control. We cannot democratically plan to solve the housing shortage if we do not own and control the means of solving that shortage. This is a class issue. How many more deaths do we need for people to wake up and realise that those who own and control the means of producing wealth do not care where their workers live, so long as these workers can get to work to create profits for shareholders. To be the masters of our own lives we need a different system where we create wealth for the benefit of the whole of society, not just for the fabulously wealthy 1,000 individuals at the top who own and control £658bn – wealth that has been created by the labour of working class people."],[8,"After the Manchester attack: how do I talk to my children about distressing news stories?","After horrific events like the attack on the Manchester Arena, it’s tempting to try to shield your family – but what if someone else tells them? In a piece first published in 2015, Annalisa Barbieri examines how best to help them cope\n\nI have only once actively hidden a news item from my daughter. She was three when Madeleine McCann went missing, far too young to know about such things. It became the big news item I shielded her from over the years: folding newspapers over, turning off the news if it came on. I knew that one day someone would tell her about it and of course, one day, someone did. A bigger girl at school, giddy with the currency of what she saw merely as gossip, embellished an already horrific story with details so terrifying it took me months to unravel the awful, native, facts – such as they were known – from the fiction my daughter had been fed. But, because this older girl had got there before me, her additions were tenacious and still, at times, colour my daughter’s view of the event.\n\nI resolved to never again hide big news from her. I wouldn’t force-feed it to my children, but I wouldn’t run from it, either.\n\nBut, occasionally the news is so big, so awful that parents wonder what, if anything they should say to their child. Should we, anyway, be talking about world events to our children?\n\n“Absolutely,” says Hilary Ann Salinger, a child and adolescent psychotherapist. “The problem is that you can’t protect children from information anymore. It’s all very well saying you don’t want them to know, but there really isn’t any way of insulating them because the news is everywhere. The important thing is to talk about it in a way that doesn’t feed into the hysteria.”\n\nThis is why it’s important to let children have access to facts, either good news sources that they can read directly, or information from you that is, as far as possible, unbiased.\n\nHowever, there is a difference between not hiding news from your children, and purposely telling them it. Here, discretion and a knowledge of your own child is important and necessary. Some children are incredibly sensitive. (Also treat siblings as the individuals they are; you may need to sometimes handle news differently according to each child’s age and sensibilities.)\n\nIf the news is something they may hear from someone else, you may decide to get in there first, either by “making it possible for children to hear/see the news”, as Salinger puts it, or telling them about it first. Be aware that sitting them down formally “does make it more of an issue”, says Salinger. “But the most important thing for all children, even teenagers, is that they need to know their parents will keep them safe. Thus it’s also important that children are introduced to any news story within the security of their parents’ confidence.”\n\nSalinger recommends coming from a point of safety first when talking about news – reinforcing the good things about your environment: for example, that you don’t live in an earthquake zone, or that violent attacks are very rare, before going on to discuss the news item.\n\n“Children find the randomness of awful news frightening, a bus crashing, an earthquake, a bomb going off on the tube,” explains Salinger. “And it’s OK to admit that you feel nervous about these things, too. Rather that blithely say, ‘Oh it’s OK, we’ll be fine,’ it’s better to say something like, ‘Yes I’m nervous about that too,’ but show that you can balance up your worries with the reality of it actually happening.”\n\nThen will come the questions – and this is where many parents get scared, usually because they don’t know the answer. It’s OK not to know. “If we can be confident about not knowing and not understanding, our children can too,” say Salinger. “So many people, and our education, teaches us that if we don’t understand something we should shut up. But really, we should just carry on asking questions.”\n\nIf you show your children that it’s OK to talk about scary subjects, this will give them the confidence to talk about them, too. Avoid hiding things as soon as they walk into the room, turning the telly off, closing down web pages etc; anyone who has ever done this will know how keen children then are to find out what’s really going on – and that’s when their imagination takes over.\n\nSo avoid only telling them half the story and not allowing them to ask any more. Children tend to make up what they don’t know, what they’re not told and it’s often the stuff of their nightmares. Which is why resolution, even partial, is important.\n\nSo let them ask questions. And be aware that these questions may not come at a convenient time. “Not right now,” is fine if you can’t talk, but try suffixing it with, “Let’s talk about this later, because I’m driving now (or whatever). Will you remind me?”\n\nAnswer any questions simply, calmly, factually and as much as possible, free of your own spin. And listen to the question and make sure you answer it and no more. Let them ask more questions if they need to.\n\nIt’s OK to show emotion because you will teach your children that it’s natural to feel emotional at certain news items. But keep hysteria out of it. Children will take their lead from you. If you make them feel secure, in talking about subjects, in asking questions, they can use that to help them with it. If you shut down, they will learn they can’t “go there”.\n\nRemember that children “puddle jump” with emotions and may ask you questions about something you told them weeks or months before. This doesn’t mean they’ve been thinking about it all that time.\n\n“The important thing,” reassures Salinger, “is that we give them perspective, so that they can learn to discriminate and we have to start that process really early. I would always talk rather than protect, because I’m not confident of my ability to protect my child from information. But I am confident of my ability to talk to them about it.”"],[8,"What would happen if the world suddenly went vegetarian?","People become vegetarians for a variety of reasons. Some do it to alleviate animal suffering, others because they want to pursue a healthier lifestyle. Still others are fans of sustainability or wish to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nNo matter how much their carnivorous friends might deny it, vegetarians have a point: cutting out meat delivers multiple benefits. And the more who make the switch, the more those perks would manifest on a global scale.\n\nBut if everyone became a committed vegetarian, there would be serious drawbacks for millions, if not billions, of people.\n\n“It’s a tale of two worlds, really,” says Andrew Jarvis of Colombia’s International Centre for Tropical Agriculture. “In developed countries, vegetarianism would bring all sorts of environmental and health benefits. But in developing countries there would be negative effects in terms of poverty.”\n\nJarvis and other experts at the centre hypothesised what might happen if meat dropped off the planet’s menu overnight.\n\nFirst, they examined climate change. Food production accounts for one-quarter to one-third of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, and the brunt of responsibility for those numbers falls to the livestock industry. Despite this, how our dietary choices affect climate change is often underestimated. In the US, for example, an average family of four emits more greenhouse gases because of the meat they eat than from driving two cars – but it is cars, not steaks, that regularly come up in discussions about global warming.\n\n“Most people don’t think of the consequences of food on climate change,” says Tim Benton, a food security expert at the University of Leeds. “But just eating a little less meat right now might make things a whole lot better for our children and grandchildren.”\n\nMarco Springmann, a research fellow at the Oxford Martin School’s Future of Food programme, tried to quantify just how much better: he and his colleagues built computer models that predicted what would happen if everyone became vegetarian by 2050. The results indicate that – largely thanks to the elimination of red meat – food-related emissions would drop by about 60%. If the world went vegan instead, emissions declines would be around 70%.\n\n“When looking at what would be in line with avoiding dangerous levels of climate change, we found that you could only stabilise the ratio of food-related emissions to all emissions if everyone adopted a plant-based diet,” Springmann says. “That scenario is not very realistic – but it highlights the importance that food-related emissions will play in the future.”\n\nFood, especially livestock, also takes up a lot of room – a source of both greenhouse gas emissions due to land conversion and of biodiversity loss. Of the world’s approximately five billion hectares (12 billion acres) of agricultural land, 68% is used for livestock.\n\nShould we all go vegetarian, ideally we would dedicate at least 80% of that pastureland to the restoration of grasslands and forests, which would capture carbon and further alleviate climate change. Converting former pastures to native habitats would likely also be a boon to biodiversity, including for large herbivores such as buffalo that were pushed out for cattle, as well as for predators like wolves that are often killed in retaliation for attacking livestock.\n\nThe remaining 10 to 20% of former pastureland could be used for growing more crops to fill gaps in the food supply. Though a relatively small increase in agricultural land, this would more than make up for the loss of meat because one-third of the land currently used for crops is dedicated to producing food for livestock – not for humans.\n\nBoth environmental restoration and conversion to plant-based agriculture would require planning and investment, however, given than pasturelands tend to be highly degraded. “You couldn’t just take cows off the land and expect it to become a primary forest again on its own,” Jarvis says.\n\nCarnivorous careers\n\nPeople formerly engaged in the livestock industry would also need assistance transitioning to a new career, whether in agriculture, helping with reforestation or producing bioenergy from crop byproducts currently used as livestock feed.\n\nSome farmers could also be paid to keep livestock for environmental purposes. “I’m sitting here in Scotland where the Highlands environment is very manmade and based largely on grazing by sheep,” says Peter Alexander, a researcher in socio-ecological systems modelling at the University of Edinburgh. “If we took all the sheep away, the environment would look different and there would be a potential negative impact on biodiversity.”\n\nShould we fail to provide clear career alternatives and subsidies for former livestock-related employees, meanwhile, we would probably face significant unemployment and social upheaval – especially in rural communities with close ties to the industry.\n\n“There are over 3.5 billion domestic ruminants on earth, and tens of billions of chickens produced and killed each year for food,” says Ben Phalan, who researches the balance between food demand and biodiversity at the University of Cambridge. “We’d be talking about a huge amount of economic disruption.”\n\nBut even the best-laid plans probably wouldn’t be able to offer alternative livelihoods for everyone. Around one-third of the world’s land is composed of arid and semi-arid rangeland that can only support animal agriculture. In the past, when people have attempted to convert parts of the Sahel – a massive east-to-west strip of Africa located south of the Sahara and north of the equator – from livestock pasture to croplands, desertification and loss of productivity have ensued. “Without livestock, life in certain environments would likely become impossible for some people,” Phalan says. That especially includes nomadic groups such as the Mongols and Berbers who, stripped of their livestock, would have to settle permanently in cities or towns – likely losing their cultural identity in the process.\n\nPlus, even those whose entire livelihoods do not depend on livestock would stand to suffer. Meat is an important part of history, tradition and cultural identity. Numerous groups around the world give livestock gifts at weddings, celebratory dinners such as Christmas centre around turkey or roast beef, and meat-based dishes are emblematic of certain regions and people. “The cultural impact of completely giving up meat would be very big, which is why efforts to reduce meat consumption have often faltered,” Phalan says.\n\nThe effect on health is mixed, too. Springmann’s computer model study showed that, should everyone go vegetarian by 2050, we would see a global mortality reduction of 6-10%, thanks to a lessening of coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some cancers. Eliminating red meat accounts for half of that decline, while the remaining benefits are thanks to scaling back the number of calories people consume and increasing the amount of fruit and vegetables they eat. A worldwide vegan diet would further amplify these benefits: global vegetarianism would stave off about 7 million deaths per year, while total veganism would knock that estimate up to 8 million. Fewer people suffering from food-related chronic illnesses would also mean a reduction in medical bills, saving about 2-3% of global gross domestic product. \n\nBut realising these projected benefits would require replacing meat with nutritionally appropriate substitutes. Animal products contain more nutrients per calorie than vegetarian staples like grains and rice, so choosing the right replacement would be important, especially for the world’s estimated two billion-plus undernourished people. “Going vegetarian globally could create a health crisis in the developing world, because where would the micronutrients come from?” Benton says.\n\nAll in moderation\n\nBut fortunately, the entire world doesn’t need to convert to vegetarianism or veganism to reap many of the benefits while limiting the repercussions.\n\nInstead, moderation in meat-eating’s frequency and portion size is key. One study found that simply conforming to the World Health Organization’s dietary recommendations would bring the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions down by 17% – a figure that would drop by an additional 40% should citizens further avoid animal products and processed snacks. “These are dietary changes that consumers would barely notice, like having a just-slightly-smaller piece of meat,” Jarvis says. “It’s not this either-or, vegetarian-or-carnivore scenario.”\n\nCertain changes to the food system also would encourage us all to make healthier and more environmentally-friendly dietary decisions, says Springmann – like putting a higher price tag on meat and making fresh fruits and vegetables cheaper and more widely available. Addressing inefficiency would also help: thanks to food loss, waste and overeating, fewer than 50% of the calories currently produced are actually used effectively.\n\n“There is a way to have low productivity systems that are high in animal and environmental welfare – as well as profitable – because they’re producing meat as a treat rather than a daily staple,” Benton says. “In this situation, farmers get the exact same income. They’re just growing animals in a completely different way.”\n\nIn fact, clear solutions already exist for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock industry. What is lacking is the will to implement those changes.\n\nJoin 700,000+ Future fans by liking us onFacebook, or follow us onTwitter,Google+,LinkedInandInstagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

I’m starting to feel the impact a little bit but actually I have generally felt really energised by the experience of being here, being supported by people and having the opportunity to engage in conversations with people.\n\n“Who knows what the impact of this will be?”\n\nAsked how he would break his fast, he said: “I really fancy a curry, to be honest. That’s always my go-to meal of choice.\n\n“One of the reasons I don’t feel that hungry is that I know I have a meal waiting for me. But not everyone has that.\n\n“When our guests leave to our foodbank, they have food but before they come, they don’t know where the next meal is going to come from.”\n\nMr McNab said while his friends had joked about taunting him with food during his stunt, he had had nothing but positive reactions from the public.\n\nHe said: “I was slightly nervous that we would be the subject of abuse, but overall, we have been very positively received, and the conversations we have had have been thought-provoking on both sides.”\n\nShipley Foodbank Centre forms part of the Bradford North Foodbank and served 1,300 people last year, with numbers growing.\n\nThe foodbank is holding a food collection at Shipley Asda this Saturday from 10am to 4pm."],[8,"What to Remember Before Watching ‘Orange Is the New Black’ Season 5","Watching is The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site.\n\nIt’s billed as a dramedy, but Netflix’s women-in-prison series, “Orange Is the New Black,” just keeps getting darker. The show’s fourth season ended with its most painful twist to date: During a peaceful protest in the Litchfield Penitentiary cafeteria, the inmates demanded the resignation of a heartless new commanding officer, Desi Piscatella (Brad William Henke), and he responded by ordering the guards to physically remove the women from the room. Amid the chaos that ensued, an inexperienced officer named Baxter Bayley (Alan Aisenberg) accidentally killed one of the show’s most beloved characters, Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley).\n\nOutraged by the Litchfield leadership’s apparent indifference to an inmate’s death at the hands of a guard, the prisoners rioted. Season 5, which debuts Friday, takes place over just three days of that riot. Here’s a rundown of what the major characters were up to when last we saw them.\n\nPoussey was Taystee’s best friend in the world, so, of course, she spends the finale deep in mourning. At work in the office of Joe Caputo (Nick Sandow), the warden, Taystee (played by Danielle Brooks) is horrified to learn that he has neither reported Poussey’s death to authorities nor contacted her father. Later, she overhears him giving a televised news conference in which he defends Bayley, and she starts the riot that slowly spreads throughout the prison. Her rallying cry: “They didn’t even say her name!”\n\nUndermined by both Piscatella, who’s popular among the prison’s incompetent new staff, and by the suits at Management & Correction Corporation (the private company that runs the prison), Caputo became a fairly impotent figure in Season 4. But he takes the power back in the finale, going off-script in his news conference and refusing to pin Poussey’s death on Bayley, as the corporation’s reps have instructed him to do. Taystee isn’t wrong to be angered by what she sees as his eagerness to let Poussey’s killer off the hook. What she doesn’t realize is that Caputo only defends Bayley because he knows that his bosses and Piscatella deserve the bulk of the blame.\n\nIt’s Suzanne (Uzo Aduba) whom Bayley is attempting to subdue when he suffocates Poussey, so presumably guilt is what drives her new obsession with finding out “what it feels like not to breathe.” To that end, she knocks down all the shelves in the library, where Poussey used to work, and literally buries herself in books. Brook Soso (Kimiko Glenn) happens to find her just in time to save her life. In the infirmary, Suzanne is reunited with Maureen Kukudio (Emily Althaus), the manipulative ex-paramour she nearly killed in a fight orchestrated by yet another cruel guard, Thomas Humphrey (Michael Torpey).\n\nInterested in getting suggestions on what to watch?

So Brook is doubly heartbroken that the woman she loves is the only casualty of that demonstration. She spends most of the finale crying and drinking Poussey’s hidden bags of hooch alone until she drunkenly stumbles upon Suzanne and becomes an accidental hero.\n\nPiper (Taylor Schilling) possesses a combination of ignorance and hubris that tends to get her in trouble, and in Season 4, the all-white security team she started got her branded a Nazi (literally). At the same time, Alex (Laura Prepon) kicked off the season by killing Aydin Bayat (Juri Henley-Cohn), a new guard who was sent to Litchfield in order to murder her. By the finale, Piper and Alex have rekindled their on-again, off-again romance, and Piper is helping a guilty Alex burn the incriminating notes she left around the prison that mention Aydin’s real name.\n\nWeak and exhausted thanks to Piscatella’s sleep-deprivation torture, Red (Kate Mulgrew) nonetheless musters the strength to rally her family for a new gardening project in the aftermath of Poussey’s death. “I smell trouble coming,” she says. “I want this family busy.”\n\nAfter Nicky (Natasha Lyonne) had a heartbreaking heroin relapse midway through the season, Red forced her to get clean again. By the finale, she’s survived what she wryly refers to as “lockdown rapid detox” and is back to her old tricks — namely, cornering Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) in hopes of rekindling their friends-with-benefits arrangement.\n\nLorna finally got the prison wedding of her dreams last season — and then proceeded to self sabotage, alienating her new husband, Vince (John Magaro), with deranged accusations. When Nicky pins her against a wall in the finale, Morello breaks down and confesses that she’s losing control of her marriage. “I’m watching it happen, and I can’t stop myself,” she sobs.\n\nOne of the sweetest story lines in the past few seasons has been the friendship between Litchfield’s most out-and-proud butch lesbian, Big Boo (Lea DeLaria), and Tiffany (Taryn Manning), who was once its most outspoken bigot. Less sweet is the complicated relationship that has developed between Tiffany and Charlie (James McMenamin), the guard who raped her in Season 3, and whom she and Boo later assaulted together. Season 4 had her slowly reconciling with her apologetic attacker, to Boo’s initial disgust. But the women are friends again by the finale, when Charlie tells Tiffany that he’s going to quit. She kisses him and he resists the urge to go any further because, he says, “I don’t wanna be what I was to you.”\n\nConfined to the Security Housing Unit, ostensibly for her own protection, Sophia (Laverne Cox) is liberated in the penultimate episode of Season 4, thanks to the efforts of Sister Ingalls (Beth Fowler). She doesn’t play a huge role in the finale, but we do see her looking somewhat recovered despite a stream of transphobic harassment from Litchfield’s resident white-supremacist gang.\n\nAfter Poussey’s death, Taystee is devastated, Suzanne goes off the rails, and Black Cindy (Adrienne C. Moore) just keeps being Black Cindy. But their friend Janae (Vicky Jeudy) gets angrier and angrier as the finale progresses — until she punches out one of the white supremacists and discovers that their racist clique isn’t nearly as tough as it’s trying to look.\n\nAs their fellow inmates mourn, Maritza (Diane Guerrero) and Flaca (Jackie Cruz) apply face masks and practice crying, just in case TV news cameras come to the prison.\n\nIn the most outlandish subplot of Season 4, Yoga Jones (Constance Shulman) and her famous roommate, Judy King (Blair Brown), have an ecstasy-fueled threesome with Luschek (Matt Peters), the guy who runs Litchfield’s electrical shop. But Yoga has a crisis of conscience the morning after, and her guilt over their special treatment drives a wedge between her and Judy. In the finale, Yoga tries to convince Judy to use her contraband cellphone to call the police and report Poussey’s murder. Not only does she refuse, but the corporation decides to release her early so she won’t be caught up in the media circus that is sure to follow Caputo’s news conference. Unfortunately for Judy, the riot starts just as she’s about to leave the prison, trapping her inside.\n\nThe second-to-last episode of Season 4 filled in Bayley’s back story, and it wasn’t much of a surprise: He’s an impressionable kid with a history of doing stupid things to earn his peers’ respect. He isn’t malicious, but he doesn’t have the experience or strength of character to disobey a bad order. As a result, he has Poussey’s blood on his hands, and he looks like a broken person as he haunts the halls of Litchfield until Caputo sends him home.\n\nPiscatella, the new commanding officer, hopes that Caputo will join him and the rest of the guards in cooking up a story about how Poussey attacked an officer. But, to his credit, Caputo finally puts Piscatella in his place and sends him home for the weekend. Will we ever have to see Piscatella again? Considering that Season 5 spans the three days following the riot, we may get a brief reprieve.\n\nWho is the worst person at Litchfield? Piscatella or Humphrey? Piscatella is a brute, Humphrey is a sadist who made Maritza eat a live mouse, and together they spent Season 4 transforming an already declining prison into a waking nightmare for inmates. In the finale, Humphrey’s bright idea to bring a gun to work for self-protection backfires during the riot, putting his own life and the life of his fellow guard Artesian McCullough (Emily Tarver) at stake.\n\nIt was a tough season for sweet Daya Diaz (Dascha Polanco), whose baby remained stuck in foster care. Despite the best efforts of her surrogate mother, Gloria Mendoza (Selenis Leyva), Daya fell in with a tough group of younger women, and although it seemed inevitable that she’d end up in trouble, no one could predict the season’s final twist. When Humphrey drops his gun, it’s Daya who picks it up. In the last moments of the finale, she has it aimed at his head.\n\nPoussey is dead, yes, but the season finale doubles as a tribute to her memory. The few moments of levity in the episode come from her flashback, which also feels like a fantasy of her journey to the afterlife. (“Is this the bus to the underworld?” she asks her friends as they set out for New York.) She spends a magical night in the city, partying with drag queens and smoking weed with a group of improv enthusiasts dressed as Buddhist monks. Poussey’s death upset plenty of viewers, but these scenes gave some poetic closure to a character whose sheer goodness and relatable qualities made her the closest thing “Orange” had to a heroine."],[8,"Gemma Whelan Q&A: on Game of Thrones, The Crown, The Moorside and new audiobook 'Just One Damned Thing After Another'","Whelan plays Yara Greyjoy in ...Thrones\n\nToday, Audible issues a new audiobook based on Jodi Taylor’s The Chronicles of St Mary’s series. Just One Damned Thing After Another is a Terry Pratchett- and Neil Gaiman-inspired adventure that follows Madeleine Maxwell (Max) and her colleagues as they travel through time to investigate major historical events at their source.\n\nNME met up with Game of Thrones and The Moorside star Gemma Whelan to talk about her role in Just One Damned Thing…, as well as her other projects: Game of Thrones, series two of Netflix’s enormous-budgeted historical drama The Crown, and controversial TV special The Moorside, in which she played Karen Matthews, who faked the kidnap of her daughter, Shannon, in 2008.\n\nNME: So: in Just One Damned Thing After Another, what’s your character Kalinda Black like?\n\nGemma: “Kal is feisty and Mancunian and very front-footed, no messing, a leader. She doesn’t take any bullshit and she’s very witty.”\n\nWhat’s it like recording an audiobook? How does it work? \n\n“Normally I just read a book by myself in a room, but this one varies from two of us to 15 of us together, depending on how much background is needed, or if there’s lots of huffing and puffing, or an angry-people mob or whatever in the background. It’s a good job there’s air conditioning.”\n\nHave you done radio stuff before? Is it similar?\n\n“I’ve done radio plays before. It is similar but the radio play I’ve done before, we recorded it in an old Georgian house and we were just all over the house for different acoustics and stuff. This one is in a studio so it’s slightly different.”\n\nIf you could travel anywhere in time, when would you travel to and why?\n\n“The Second World War. Even though in the book we go to the First, I think the Second is a war which some of my relatives served in and to really understand what that was like would be very, very interesting. We can only imagine, but to be rationed and in fear of your life for a lot of your everyday life, and that become a normal thing is quite an extraordinary phenomenon that we’re so lucky we don’t really live in now.\n\n“I know there’s the threat of terrorism and all sorts, but there’s not a hugely tangible threat in London, I don’t think, and yet back in the Second World War there would have been daily scares and people seemingly got on with things. I think it would be interesting to go and see what that was actually like. I would also go and meet a dinosaur if it was an option. From a distance.”\n\nMoving onto other roles – your transformation into Karen Matthews for The Moorside was amazing. How did you go about preparing for it?\n\n“I read a lot, I was given a lot of research material, I was very well supported in terms of production and direction, hair and make up. The whole thing was very sensitive and respectfully handled in my opinion. I think many people share that opinion because it was extremely important to get it right. So yes, I read a lot of books, I watched all of the footage that was available of her documentaries and news footage, and worked very hard to try and understand what I could about that case.”\n\nWhat about your comedy character Chastity Butterworth? Is she still around?\n\n“She is still alive and well! I’ve just done a radio pilot on Radio 4, a chat show on which Charles Dance among many other greats came on as my guest and we had a hoot. That was broadcast a couple of months ago and we’re hoping to get a series but we’ll see what happens.”\n\nWhat’s been your favourite scene to shoot on Game of Thrones?\n\n“Probably the ones with very beautiful, majestic coastlines, because it’s just so extraordinary to behold. The Antrim coast is phenomenally beautiful. To think you’re at work and then be on this beautiful coastline is quite pinch-worthy sometimes – it’s a real privilege. I think we all realise how lucky we are when we’re doing it. Every day is enjoyable on Game of Thrones for me, but when you get a nice view as well it’s a bonus!\n\nHow about challenging scenes?\n\n“Fighting scenes are challenging. Doing scenes where you’ve got to be in the water for a long time is challenging because it’s just cold and often they’re long night-shoots and stuff. This is not me playing a tiny violin, I realise how lucky I am. If it’s challenging I’d rather be in a nice warm brothel than I would in the sea – but you know, wouldn’t we all!”\n\nWhat’s your favourite thing about Yara?\n\n“She’s just a glorious character to play. She’s strong, and front-footed, and knows her mind, is apologetic but sensitive, family-oriented but not saccharine. She’s just brilliant! I think she speaks for herself really. She’s very, very likeable for all sorts of good feminist reasons.”\n\nWhat are you working on right now?\n\n“I am doing The Crown at the moment.\n\nCan you talk about that at all?\n\nBut it’s set ten years after the first series?\n\nWhat can you say?\n\n“I can say that I’m doing a lovely guest part in one episode.”\n\nJust One Damned Thing After Another is available now on Audible."],[8,"The Greatest Support You Can Offer Someone Who Has Suffered A Stillbirth","Ten babies are stillborn in the UK every day. A stillbirth is one of the most devastating experience for parents. But what makes this experience even harder to bear is that these bereaved parents, who would have looked forward to a circle of delighted support had their baby been brought home, instead are left to grieve alone, feel they make people uncomfortable or worse have to suffer unhelpful platitudes like “it was meant to be” and “you’ll have another”. HuffPost Parents spoke to parents whose babies have been stillborn about what is the best way you can give support to friends, family or work colleagues who face the desolation of a stillbirth.\n\nAlanna and Simon Salter’s daughter Isobel was stillborn in 2015. Their son Theo was born just under a year later. The couple, from Belfast, have since started a retreat for parents whose babies have been stillborn, Still Parents.  We wanted people to recognise Isobel’s significance and the magnitude of our loss. This was our daughter who died. She was important and mattered. Friends saying her name and writing her name helped because we were afraid she would be forgotten. Nearly two years later we still have friends who text on the 26th of each month to say they’re thinking of us, and we appreciate that. Think before you make unhelpful comments. There is no good way for a child to die. It’s unhelpful to tell us “Well, you didn’t have a relationship - it would be worse if she’d been born and died or an older child died.” You can’t put levels of better and worse on the death of a baby. Telling us everything happens for a reason is absolute rubbish. There is no reason. Asking “what was wrong?” isn’t helpful. There was nothing wrong. She was perfect. The placenta stopped working without any warning. If she had been born a day earlier, she would have survived. Don’t shut down the conversation. We prefer people asking “What happened?” rather than an embarrassed “OK, right.” We just want to talk about our baby. We can’t talk about her first words, but we can talk about what she looked like. Don’t just say nothing. It hurt me when people at work didn’t even acknowledge what had happened. We appreciated practical help in the immediate aftermath, like friends bringing food, helping sort out the funeral and the headstone. A friend came with me to buy a funeral outfit. Dads grieve too. I had to go back to work two weeks later. I was expected to snap back into functioning as normal while everyone asked, “Are you looking after her?” Try and understand what it must be like to be pregnant again when your first baby died. It was a very different pregnancy with Theo. I was very anxious, I didn’t want to get attached to my growing baby. We didn’t really even talk about my pregnancy. Dr Alex Heazell is clinical director at Tommy’s Stillbirth Research Clinic at St Mary’s Hospital, Manchester.  Part of the research centre is Tommy’s Rainbow Clinic which provides specialist antenatal care and reassurance for women who have suffered a previous stillbirth or neonatal death. We shouldn’t downplay parents’ grief. The most important thing friends and family must understand is this is the death of a baby. For a long time, having a stillborn baby was not regarded as significant. It is. We need to acknowledge their loss and the loss of their hopes and dreams for this baby and what could have been, Don’t come out with platitudes. Phrases like “it wasn’t meant to be” or “you can always have another one” are not comforting. The best thing you can do is put your arms around someone who is grieving for their baby and acknowledge how terrible this is.  Another baby is never a “replacement baby”. There is a perception that having another baby will replace your stillborn child. This is not true. Each baby is unique. Parents will always wonder what their child would have been like and will remember their baby’s anniversary throughout their lives.\n\nHayley and Adam’s Pownsey’s son Joshua was born in 2014. He was stillborn as a result of complications during the birth. The hospital has since admitted three counts of negligence.  Hayley, 32, and Adam, 34, from Bury, Lancashire, have a two-year-old daughter Edie and baby George, born in January this year. Don’t forget our baby existed.  Joshua will always be our first child. You can’t move on as if it never happened. We love talking about Joshua. By asking questions you’re keeping his memory alive. People still feel awkward, but we’ve got better at talking about it. After Joshua’s death we went to so many garden centres, just to get out of the house but not risk bumping into anyone we knew. There is still a stigma attached to stillbirth, but now I tell people ‘I had a little boy, he was my first’. Be prepared for grief to hit again when you have another baby. Seeing Edie alive and looking so similar to Joshua brought a lot of emotions up again. Erica Stewart is Sands’ Bereavement Support and Awareness Specialist. Parents don’t ‘get over’ the experience of a stillbirth.  They learn to live with it, but it’s an experience that will change their lives for ever. They will find a new normal. Using the right language is important. They haven’t lost my baby, which implies carelessness. Their baby died. As a society we’re not good about talking about death, and the death of a baby is even more taboo. It’s important to acknowledge the enormity of this experience. Offer real practical support. Be proactive. Don’t say ‘let me know if you need anything’. Do say ‘I’m come round at 6’ or ‘I’m bringing dinner’. Parents spend time with their stillborn babies. They will have photos, keepsakes and memory boxes. Invite them to talk and listen. Michelle Cottle’s daughter Orla was stillborn in May 2016 at 37 weeks.  Michelle and her husband Andy now have a second daughter, Esme who was born in April. Michelle blogs about her experience at Dear Orla.  There is still a stigma and shock associated with stillbirth. We need to talk about it. It’s the absolute worst type of loss and completely against the natural order of life.  Sadly, this is something that happens every single day and can happen to anyone - even healthy people who do all of the right things.  That’s what was hard for me - the research talks about risk factors (smoking, obesity), which indicates that there should be a cause. I did everything right and my baby still died. The fact that this can happen needs to be spoken about in order to reduce shame and guilt. Don’t be scared to call or visit. Help the grieving parent feel that they are still worthy of your company. Acknowledge that that person has become a parent and that they deserve that title more than anyone. Keep checking in and messaging even if you get no response - say more than just “I’m thinking of you”, which feels really impersonal. Read advice from organisations like Sands and Tommy’s (see below). Whatever you do, don’t ignore our loss. This is what helped me: saying Orla’s name, coming and sitting with me even if I couldn’t say anything, holding my hand, just telling me how unfair this is and how I don’t deserve this. Crying with us (but not so much that their own feelings overshadowed ours). \n\nViki Ferguson’s daughter Megan was stillborn at 35 weeks in 2013. Viki, 44, from Northumberland, and her husband Colin have not had any more children. Most people’s reaction is “I don’t know what to say!” It’s natural to feel shocked. There is nothing more you can say than “I’m sorry”. It sounds inadequate but it’s not. Don’t feel awkward about asking how we’re feeling. You can’t take our pain away, but you can show you’re thinking about us. It’s OK to ask “Are you OK?” It’s not silly to ask. How else will you find out? But don’t expect someone who’s had a stillborn baby to always put on a brave face. Be prepared for people to say “actually today I’m not fine” and don’t back away. There’s nothing worse than feeling someone’s avoiding you. Seeing a baby doesn’t make me sad. It seems every other day there’s a baby or small child at work. It’s a joyous thing. I love seeing them grow up and I always get a little cuddle. Three of us were pregnant at the same time - the other two babies will be starting school in September. Megan never got to start her life journey.  \n\n The facts about stillbirths  A stillborn baby is one who has died before or during birth at or after 24 weeks of pregnancy. The loss of a baby before 24 weeks of pregnancy is classed as a miscarriage. Around one-third of stillbirths happen after 37 weeks of pregnancy. Stillbirths account for more than half of the deaths of babies under one year in the UK. Many people think that stillbirths happen because of a developmental or genetic problem that means the baby could not survive. In fact, this is the case for fewer than one in 10 stillborn babies.  For as many as 6 in 10 stillborn babies, the cause of death is not known. Around half of all stillbirths are linked to placental complications. This may happen gradually, and it may not be picked up by current routine antenatal monitoring. Other causes of stillbirth include: bleeding (haemorrhage) before or during labour placental abruption, when the placenta separates from the womb before the baby is born; complications of pre-eclampsia, which is linked with the placenta and causes high blood pressure; the umbilical cord slipping down through the entrance of the womb before the baby is born (known as cord prolapse) or wrapping around the baby’s neck. Around 500 babies die every year because of a trauma or event during birth that was not anticipated or well managed. Sands supports anyone affected by the death of a baby, campaigns to improve the bereavement care received by parents and families and promotes research to reduce the number of babies dying. Tommy’s funds research into the causes and prevention of pregnancy problems that lead to miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth. They also provide pregnancy health information for parents-to-be. "],[8,"GOP repeal bill would unravel protection for sick Americans","Republicans’ latest bid to dismantle Obamacare threatens to turn back the clock on protections for the sickest Americans — and stealthily undermine one of President Donald Trump’s biggest health care promises.\n\nThe proposal backed by House conservatives — and negotiated with moderate Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) — would give states sweeping power to opt out of core Obamacare provisions. Those states would instead set up “high-risk pools,” tried by about three dozen states, red and blue, in the years before the Affordable Care Act to cover people with expensive medical conditions. Most of the pools didn’t work, leaving countless people with cancer, diabetes and other expensive diseases with inadequate coverage — if they had anything at all.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe latest legislation satisfies demands from the party’s rightmost flank, which had wanted a sharper break with Obamacare. Yet it’s not clear that it can pass the House, particularly after moderates repeatedly pledged to protect the millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions who are likely to lose their current coverage and end up in these high-risk pools.\n\nThe compromise legislation would allow insurers in those states to charge sicker people higher premiums if they haven’t been consistently covered. That marks the revival of a system that could stick the nation’s most vulnerable with skyrocketing insurance costs and far skimpier benefits — and renege on Trump’s promise not to cut Americans’ health coverage.\n\n“Except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare,” Trump said a year ago during a CNN-Telemundo campaign debate. “I want to keep pre-existing conditions. I think we need it, I think it’s a modern age, and I think we have to have it.” The House GOP has also committed to protecting people who need expensive treatments, vowing on its website not to let insurers charge anyone more for having a pre-existing condition.\n\nThis bill doesn’t meet those standards. The Congressional Budget Office estimated than an earlier version of the legislation would mean 24 million fewer people would have coverage in 10 years — and that figure is likely higher with this approach.\n\n“The bottom line is that many people will not be able to afford insurance,” Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said. Trump repeatedly promised to come up with a better plan, but this, Cummings said, would leave people with “no plan.”\n\nThe MacArthur amendment would clear the way for states to eliminate the health law’s “community rating” requirement, which prevents insurers from charging different prices based on whether someone is sick or healthy. But the state would then have to have a fallback such as a high-risk pool for those priced out of the market.\n\nStates often turned to high-risk pools in the pre-Obamacare era, in an attempt to modestly expand coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But enrollees often paid twice as much as healthy people and received both skimpier benefits and caps on coverage. Their policies often excluded treatments for the very condition that had brought them to the high-risk pool in the first place — for instance, a cancer patient who couldn’t get cancer treatment.\n\nDespite those hefty premiums, high-risk pools were often drastically underfunded, forcing states to restrict enrollment, create waiting lists and limit subsidies to low-income people. By 2011, the state high-risk pools had enrolled just 2 percent of the eligible population on average, and lost a collective $1.2 billion.\n\n“High-risk pools have a long track record, and it’s not particularly pretty,” said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina. “You have to be willing to fund them at enormous levels.”\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan defended high-risk pools on Thursday morning, saying the one in his home state of Wisconsin “was pretty actually darned good,” and federal funding would make them work even better.\n\nBut only 21,000 people — or about 7 percent of the eligible population — were enrolled in Wisconsin’s high-risk pool before it was shut down when Obamacare took effect. Premiums could run twice the private-market rate, with only the poorest enrollees qualifying for limited subsidies. Health plans carried $2 million lifetime caps and, in an effort to keep costs low, they didn’t actually cover an individual’s pre-existing condition for the first six months of enrollment.\n\nThe Obamacare repeal bill would set aside $15 billion in federal funding to help them, said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who helped negotiate the latest proposal. States could also dip into the $100 billion pool designed for market stabilization initiatives.\n\nMacArthur, who calls Obamacare’s pre-existing conditions protection “sacrosanct,” disagrees with the critics. He maintains that the changes wouldn’t lock the sickest people out of the market. His amendment preserves the Obamacare provision banning discrimination based on pre-existing conditions — except it’s toothless if insurers can charge sicker people a lot more for their coverage.\n\nHealth policy experts warn that it’s not enough to adequately care for the nation’s sickest Americans.\n\n\"By simply being able to price the policy out of reach for the average mortal, it seems to be to be kind of illusory,” said Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms and a former Democratic congressional aide. States that opt out would likely see a surge of people thrown back into the equivalent of a pre-Obamacare health system.\n\nOne alternative to the traditional high risk pools backed by some Republican lawmakers is an “invisible risk-sharing program,” a federal backstop for health plans that shoulders some of the costs for the most expensive enrollees. That concept has a chance at faring better: The money would be used to reimburse insurers and help them to keep premiums low, rather than forcing sick people out of the market.\n\nBut the idea is largely untested. Maine operated a risk-sharing program for just 18 months before Obamacare made it obsolete. There’s still debate over how significantly it contributed to falling premiums in the state’s individual market, as well as what it would cost to expand a program from covering a few thousand residents to potentially hundreds of thousands nationwide.\n\n“We can’t really draw conclusions about how adequately it was funded,” said Trish Riley, executive director for the National Academy for State Health Policy, who was a state health official in Maine for many years. “Doing reinsurance is an expensive undertaking.”\n\nAll that has left even GOP lawmakers questioning whether the MacArthur amendment can become more than an expensive path toward breaking the party’s pledge to the nation’s sickest.\n\n“People like me don’t want to go back to pre-ACA,” Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.) said. “I’m still in the process of sorting out where we are, and how much money does that take.”"],[8,"Election night 2017 as-it-happens","We're closing down this live blog after the most dramatic 24 hours British politics has seen in a long time - moreso than even the Brexit vote. When this election was called it seemed like it would be a dull victory procession. It proved to be anything but.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster has said the party will enter discussions with the Conservatives. \n\nDonald Tusk has written to Theresa May to congratulate her on being reappointed prime minister and warning that the timeframe set by Article 50 leaves no time to lose.\n\n\"On behalf of the European Council, I would like to congratulate you on your reappointment as prime minister.\n\n\"Our shared responsibility and urgent task now is to conduct the negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the European Union in the best possible spirit, securing the least disruptive outcome for our citizens, businesses and countries after March 2019. The timeframe set by Article 50 of the Treaty leaves us with no time to lose. I am fully committed to maintaining regular and close contact at our level to facilitate the work of our negotiators.\n\n\"I also look forward to welcoming you to the European Council later this month where we will discuss counter-terrorism, security and defence, trade and the Paris Agreement amongst other issues.\"\n\nWell there we go. She didn't acknowedge the shock of last night's result at all. It sounded more like a straightforward victory speech with just a quick line dropped in about the DUP. However, there were no details about the deal she has done with them so we're still in the dark on that.\n\nShe was keen to repeat the messages she has been pushing since she first became prime minister about fairness and a country where nobody is left behind. And although she didn't use the now much ridiculed term \"strong and steady\" she did talk about the need for certainty as we enter Brexit negotiations.\n\nIt was almost as if last night never happened.\n\nPrime minister: \"I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen, and I will now form a government – a government that can provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country.\n\n\"This government will guide the country through the crucial Brexit talks that begin in just 10 days and deliver on the will of the British people by taking the United Kingdom out of the European Union. \"It will work to keep our nation safe and secure by delivering the change that I set out following the appalling attacks in Manchester and London – cracking down on the ideology of Islamist extremism and all those who support it. And giving the police and the authorities the powers they need to keep our country safe.   \"The government I lead will put fairness and opportunity at the heart of everything we do, so that we fulfil the promise of Brexit together and - over the next five years - build a country in which no one and no community is left behind. \"A country in which prosperity and opportunity are shared right across this United Kingdom. \"What the country needs more than ever is certainty, and having secured the largest number of votes and the greatest number of seats in the General Election, it is clear that only the Conservative & Unionist Party has the legitimacy and ability to provide that certainty by commanding a majority in the House of Commons. \"As we do, we will continue to work with our friends and allies in the Democratic Unionist Party in particular. Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years, and this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom. \"This will allow us to come together as a country and channel our energies towards a successful Brexit deal that works for everyone in this country – securing a new partnership with the EU which guarantees our long term prosperity \"That's what people voted for last June. \"That's what we will deliver. Now let's get to work.\n\nThe prime minister is back in Downing Street and about to give a speech\n\nTheresa May is on her way to the Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a government.\n\nSturgeon is paying tribute to Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader, who lost his seat last night: \"A politician and parliamentarian of immense stature who week after week held the prime minister to account.\n\nShe now talks about Alex Salmond, the former leader of the SNP of course, who also lost his seat: \"I want to make particular mention of Alex Salmond, my friend and mentor for almost 30 years and without a shadow of a doubt the giant of modern Scottish politics.\"\n\nAnd now Nicola Sturgeon is up: \"The prime minister has lost all authority and credibility. In Scotland the SNP won this election, we have more seats than all the other parties combined.\"\n\nFarron says that Theresa May should resign.\n\nFarron goes on to pay tribute to Nick Clegg, who lost his seat last night: \"Nick Clegg is a giant of British politics, a friend and a hero to me and countless others. Not only did he lead our party into government for the first time in generations, he did so in the most difficult circumstances.\"\n\nIan is off for a little while now so it's Natalie Bloomer here. \n\nTim Farron is giving a speech: \"We have made progress in incredibly difficult circumstances and we face a new parliament in a far stronger position than we left the last one. I am delighted to welcome back some old friends: Jo Swinson, Vince Cable, Ed Davey. We are, of course, bolstering our ranks with those big figures who have served our country in government. We will now be able to put their talent and experience to shaping what comes next.\"\n\nAnd he announces his resignation. That's five Ukip leaders in nine months.\n\nPaul Nuttall currently giving a speech. \"With Brexit, we may well have won the war, but we could lose the peace. There is no getting away from the fact this is a unique election that came about at an inopportune time for our party. The prime minister was able to talk the talk while not walking the walk. It has put our Brexit at risk. I wish the prime minister, whoever that is, all the very best. I hope whoever leads the team gets the best deal for the British people, they will however, only get a good deal if they believe in our great country and they are genuinely prepared to walk away if the Brussels bureaucrats put a bad deal on the table. I hope they genuinely believe in Britain but something in my head says otherwise. Ukip are now, more than ever after last night, the guard dogs of Brexit.\"\n\nThe rumours currently going around are that the Tories really intend to keep May as leader and want to stick to the timetable on Brexit talks - in other words, to start in ten days. That's mad. Far more mad than the nonsense McDonnell is peddling. It is absurd to pretend May could go into those negotiations with any authority whatsoever. She'll have none in Brussels and none back home. It is entirely legitimate for her to stay on while she tries to sort out a deal with the DUP, asks for a delay in talks, then presides over a leadership contest. But that's the full extent of what she should be doing. After that, she should fade into the background as quickly as possible. It's weird that they haven't recognised this. I'm yet to speak to a single Tory who believes she can stay.\n\nSome very strange shenanigans going on with John McDonnell. He's touring the TV studios insisting Labour is ready to form a minority administration. You can see he's enjoying himself and that he feels he has momentum. But the numbers aren't there. You can splice them, dice them or fry them with onions, but they're not there. So if they hold a vote on their policies, as they say they will, and dare other parties to support them, they will find that they… er… don't. It's maths. There are more Tories and DUP MPs than there are all the others, so even if Labour convince the other parties to back them, it won't pass. It's hard to see how this ends in any scenario other than a Tory minority administration reliant on the DUP.\n\nFrom Chaminda:\n\nMore from Chaminda:\n\nChuka Umunna, Labour Mp for Streatham and a leading critic of Brexit, is presenting the result as a rejection of hard Brexit.\n\nHe said at his victory speech:\n\n\"The indications this evening are that the British people have fundamentally rejected her vision for Brexit and her negative campaign.\n\n“We all recognise the clear result of last year’s referendum, but I have always argued that nobody voted in that referendum to become poorer. Therefore, we must remain in the Single Market and in the Customs Union.\n\n“EU citizens here should have their rights guaranteed with immediate effect. And Leave campaigners like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove must be held to account for the promises they made.\"\n\nWell Amber Rudd, home secretary, has survived by the skin of her teeth - about 300 votes.\n\nThe Tories have a real long-term problem.\n\nThis election was a once in a generation chance for them to redraw the electoral map, to drive their much mentioned tanks deep into Labour territory. The local elections a month ago showed possible gains in unthinkable Labour heartlands - Blyth Valley, North West Durham. Even after the Tories faltered, they still had a shot at seats like Bishop Auckland and Scunthorpe. Not anymore. The Tories have gone backwards in numerous regions - they have not just lost seats on big swings in England, but they've gone backwards in Wales, been obliterated in London swing seats, and had a terrible time in southern seats the party could not have contemplated losing. Swings from Tory to Labour of ten per cent are visible around the country. Home Secretary Amber Rudd is in desperate trouble. These are not seats whose demography favoured Labour. But Jeremy Corbyn hoovered up Remain votes and held on to Leave voters who were looking for an alternative to May's drudgery and gruel. The future has arrived with warp speed. Young voters turned up in huge numbers, and turnout was up across the board - not just in student seats. And this is as what currently looks like a Tory-led government, of whatever form, heads into fiendish Brexit negotiations with the economy weakening alarmingly. Tory MPs who clung on are sitting targets whenever the next election comes - and it can't be long, as British politics descends to the level of Italy. Labour seats that the Tories had been eyeing are now miles out of reach. The Tories wanted to rebrand themselves as the party of workers, but then came out with a string of indescribably stupid missteps - the idiotic own goal of repealing the ban on fox hunting, the shambles of the dementia tax, the double-edged self-own of axeing universal free school meals without ending school funding cuts. Theresa May asked voters who had never voted Tory to trust her and lend her their votes. She then reminded them exactly why they had never voted Tory. Tonight is the result. The Tory brand is a total mess. May has wasted this Brexit-born chance to restore the party's reputation around the country. What issue can now ever persuade those voters, in those seats, having abandoned Ukip, to vote Conservative? How can the Conservatives ever secure London marginals that have become Labour safe seats overnight, such as Tooting and Ealing Central and Acton? How can the party win the votes of the young people who have overnight become a genuine force in British politics? The Scottish Conservatives have bailed out the Westminster party and their discredited shambles of May, Philip Hammond, Lynton Crosby and Nick Timothy. They don't have time to find a new strategic direction before Brexit crushes everything in its path. The Tory party is the most enduring and adaptable party in Britain, but this no-brainer of a snap election has crashed and burned because the party has failed to adapt. Seven years of Conservative austerity has created a social crisis and sense of utter alienation that the party has just assumed could carry on with no new money and no new ideas. The Tories' ceiling is suddenly a very low one.\n\nMore from Chaminda:\n\nCorbyn has won in north London with a huge majority. Here are some excerpts from his speech.\n\n\"The election campaign has gone on for past six weeks. I've travelled the whole country. You know what? Politics has changed. Politics isn't going back into box it was in before. People have said they've had quite enough of austerity politics. I'm very, very proud of the campaign my party has run. If there is a message from tonight's result, it's this. The prime minister called the election because she wanted a mandate. Well the mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes and lost confidence. I would have thought that is enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that's truly representative of the people of this country.\" May has also won, with a similarly thumping majority. Some excerpts from her: \"Returns are still coming in. We have yet to see the full picture. But at this time more than anything else this country needs period of stability. And if, as forecasts show, the Conservative party has won most seats and most votes, it is incumbent upon us to have that period of stability and that's what we will do. I would like to thank those who voted Conservative. As we look ahead and wait to see what the results will be, the country needs a period of stability and whatever the results are the Conservative party will fulfill our responsibility in that period for stability, so that we can go forward as a country together.\"\n\nMore from Chaminda:\n\nWell it's Lib Dem musical chairs. Nick Clegg is gone. And Vince Cable is back. Tim Farron is reportedly on a knife edge.\n\nOK look, it's still very early for this, but let's talk about what this means for Brexit. All of this is subject to change and is said on the basis that things continue for the rest of the night as they have done so far.\n\nThe first thing to put to bed is any notion that this result stops Brexit. It does not. But it may offer a consensus against hard Brexit. This is hard to assess because Labour were so vague on the details but it seems unlikely, on the current showing, that there'll be a majority in the Commons for leaving the single market and the customs union. Labour in reality has two camps on Brexit - Keir Starmer and Corbyn. The former wants to try to renegotiate free movement terms and stay in the single market, the latter seems to want out. But putting the party policy to one side, it's not clear that MPs in a parliament formed under these results would ever vote to leave the single market. A lot now comes down to how seats go. How many Leave-voting seats go to Labour? Where does that Ukip vote go? This will all dictate the kind of approach we might see in the wake of the vote.\n\nThat all assumes Labour are in a position to do anything. We are currently seeing SNP seats fall to the Tories. That could leave them able to form a government. It is absurd to think that Remain-voting Scotland would be responsible for that, but it could well be the case. The fact it is hapening at all also counts against a Brexit-interpretation of the vote. So too does the failure of the Lib Dems to really break through. However, we should be clear. There is a Remain swell here, not least in the big cities and among the young, who overwhelmingly voted Remain and despise the nativist 1950s fairy story May delivered relentlessly since becoming leader. Even if there is no direct Brexit policy effect, this is a resounding rejection of her mean-spirited, authoritarian, interpretation of the vote. Whoever takes over must continue in a more consensual manner. Just as important is the timetable. There's really no way now that May can stay. That means that even if we see the Tories continue, which would be the path of least change, there needs to be a leadership election. That's more time, with the Article 50 ticking down, and Europe still waiting for the British team to sit down in a couple of weeks for talks. If the British team have any sense, the first thing they will do is ask for an extension on that two-year Article 50 deadline.\n\nAngus Robertson, SNP Westminster leader, has lost his seat to the Conservatives. I generally welcome nationalist losses in this election, but I must say that this is a terribly sad development. Robertson almost singlehandedly took on the job of opposition leader when Corbyn failed to challenge May at PMQs and he was ferocious and tireless in taking on Brexit. He had a rare gravitas in the Commons and was a powerful orator. It's a sad bit of news. \n\nIt also seems near certain now that Phillip Davies, a Tory MP hated by left-wingers and especially feminists for his reactionary views, has lost his seats. Left-wing Twitter right now is having some sort of euphoric breakdown.\n\nBattersea belongs to Labour. \n\nLib Dems: 4,401\n\nLabour: 25,292\n\nTories: 22,876\n\nTom Watson has won his seat. In his speech he said it already looked like May was in serious trouble. \"She is a damaged prime minister, whose reputation may never recover. People have responded to a positive campaign. People vote for hope.\"\n\nFrom Chaminda:\n\nSome very encouraging results for Labour coming in. They failed to take South Swindown off the Tories but slashed their majority from 6,000 to 2,000. That'll send shivers down the spines of officials at Conservative HQ. Wrexham - a Tory target which at one point Labour had all-but given up on keeping - has been retained by Labour. The exit poll didn't expect that, so here at least they are outperforming it. And finally they have taken Rutherglen off the SNP. It's a tiny majority of just 265, but that involved a 16% drop in SNP support. It's looking very positive indeed for Corbyn.\n\nMore from Chaminda:\n\nMore from Chaminda:\n\nIt's increasingly clear that that referendum basically broke this country. Not only has it completely reorientated our politics - and not in a particularly healthy way - but it seems to have fractured the standing assumptions of how people vote and created scenarios where the UK is basically ungovernable. As I said before, that Article 50 clock is ticking. It is ticking because May decided to trigger it and then hold an election. If we need another election Europe will be forced to watch again while we debate again and possibly end up with the same non-result again. It would seem as if Britain were broken on the world stage. A toddler smashing toys one by one while adults look by, exasperated.\n\nAnother Sunderland vote comes in showing Tories doing considerably better and Labour considerably worse. Are we seeing an underrepresentation of Tory performance in Leave seats? Is this to do with postal votes, which we think went hard for the Conservatives? Or perhaps this is just an isolated blip - reports from other areas suggest a very strong Labour performance. There is currently no clear picture.\n\nSome details from Chaminda on what to look out for over the next few hours.\n\nOK, so let's put those results to one side and assume the exit poll is still accurate. Short of a coaolition, could some sort of informal arrangement work out with a minority Tory administration? It's not impossible. Firstly, May would have to go. A Tory leader would be needed who was acceptable to the Tory party but could work with Labour on a vote by vote basis for Brexit. Who would that be? Philip Hammond has been the most vocal in his criticism of the Tory Brexit policy, but it's not clear the Conservative party  would accept him. Boris Johnson would be more tolerable to them, or perhaps Amber Rudd. Any of these three would probably adopt a softer approach to Brexit than May has done. But honestly, this is just daydreaming at this stage. It is very difficult indeed to imagine a scenario in which something like this would work. It is far more likely that we would have to have another election. And all the while that Article 50 clock ticks down, down, down. We are well and truly in the chaos scenario.\n\nSunderland result\n\nLib Dems: 908\n\nTories: 12,324\n\nUkip: 2,379\n\nLabour: 24, 665\n\nAgain, this is the not the level of swing we'd expect from that exit poll. There is a swing here of 3.5% from Labour to the Tories. It seems the Ukip vote broke down and split mostly for the Tories but a bit for Labour. Nevertheless, these results wil be cheering the Tories. But these are both safe Labour seats relatively close by, so it may be a regional thing.\n\nOK so that was obviously expected, but the change in the vote is interesting. Labour is up ten per cent on last time, but only with a 2.1% swing to Labour from the Tories. That's nowhere near the seven per cent swing in that exit poll.\n\nNewcastle Central has the firsat result of the night\n\nLib Dem: 1,812\n\nTories: 9,134\n\nUkip: 1,482\n\nLabour: 24,071\n\nInitial analysis from my colleague Chaminda Jayanetti:\n\nI've stopped laughing now, but I can't guarantee that will continue. Ok, so let's say these results are completely accurate. For the record they almost certainly are not. We understand that lots of these seats are very tight, so the final result will surely be quite wide of what we're seeing now. But anyway, we then get into the mucky maths. The magic number you need to hit is 325, that gives you the majority. There's some mess around that - basically because the Speaker and their deputies don't count and Sinn Fein don't either because they won't swear allegiance to the Queen. But that's basically the number you're aiming for. This type of scenario is better for Labour than the Tories, because there are more parties they can work with. For the Tories it's just the DUP and UUP. Labour could work with the SNP, the Lib Dems, the Greens, the SDLP and Plaid. But even there it's hard to see them stitching together enough seats on these numbers. But anyway, the opposition parties have mostly ruled out forming a coalition. The question then becomes whether one side or the other could form a minority administration.\n\nOK, so lets sound some notes of caution. Firstly, you want to give the exit poll a margin of error of about 20 seats either way. Add 20 seats to the Tories (they did better than the exit poll in 2015) and they're back in majority territory. But even then, not a strong one. She'd basically have reached where she started. It's also entirely unclear that anyone could form a government if this is the final result. To know that we'd need more info on the N.Ireland parties. I'll write more on that in a moment. First I have to stop laughing. \n\nGuys, we're in for a long and very entertaining night.\n\nOk the exit poll is in. It is extraordinary.\n\nConservatives: 314\n\nLabour: 266\n\nLib Dems: 34\n\nI have started with one of the beers.\n\nMore importantly, here are my supplies for the night (delivery pizza not included). I am of two minds as to combo on the coffee-booze with the Baileys cans, or alternate between coffee and booze to reach morning. Any suggestions on this matter, or other crucial political issues, gratefully recieved - email me at ian.dunt@politics.co.uk.\n\nOf course, it is perfectly possible that we get a hung parliament, as YouGov has suggested. That remains unlikely, although it would be very funny. If it happens it'll be quite the upset and tonight will suddenly get a considerably more interesting.\n\nYour mileage on what is a win or a loss for the parties will vary, but for the record here's mine. This is a strange election. Theresa May will almost certainly win, Jeremy Corbyn will almost certainly lose. So the question really is how they do relatively. Given May launched this election at a point where it ate up Article 50 time and that it has had a heavy toll on the general appraisal of her abilities, I think anything south of a 60 seat majority is a problem for her. Anything north of that won't necesarily save her, but she will be able to make a solid case for why she held the election in the first place. Anything above100 makes her safe, in my eyes and will considered a vindication. For Corbyn it is more complicated. We are really assessing whether his loss is severe enough in terms of seats or vote share for it boost those on the centre of the party when they try to get rid of him. On vote share, which his supporters point to as a key test for his performance, there are two bechmarks: MIliband in 2015 and Blair, the old enemy, in 2005. The former secured 30.4%, the latter 35.2%. If they get more than the first they can say with some credibility that they are going in the right direction. If they surpass the second, they can make a very good case for it and it will have tremendous symbolic value. But the reality is that the party could get a very strong vote share but still be devastated in terms of seats, especially if they pile on votes in metropolitan areas or university towns. \n\nAnd we're off. There's just half an hour to go until that exit poll is released. That poll has turned into legend a bit since 2015 and it is good. It uses a huge sample size - I think it's about 20,000 - from carefully chosen constituencies. It also only questions those who have definitely voted, because it is conducted outside polling stations. So that messy issue of whether people - especially young people - will actually vote is no longer a problem. But still, it's not a biblical tablet. It's very good for giving you the ballpark outcome, but not the specifics.  \n\nWhy hello there. You're here early. There'll be no Politics.co.uk coverage today, because the nation is going to the polls and there isn't much to say about that really. Also there are laws around what you can and can't say as journalists on days like this which we frankly don't understand, so we tend to just stay on the safe side and shut up.\n\nOur coverage of the election results will start at around 9:30pm tonight, just before polls close. You may remember that 10pm moment from 2015 when all your hopes were crushed, a state in which they have largely remained until today. Perhaps tonight will be different. Perhaps not. Perhaps even what I just wrote was breaking some obscure election law somewhere. How exciting. Anyway, I'm Ian Dunt and I'll be manning the live blog throughout the night, bringing you the latest news, analysis, comment, sleep-deprived ramblings and occasional expressions of catatonic despair. We'll stay with you throughout the evening and into the morning. And probably – depending on hung parliaments, resignations, whatever – into Friday afternoon. It all depends on how long things are happening.  See you later on."],[8,"Trump Twitter blocks lead to constitutionality question","The lawyers of two Twitter users whose accounts were blocked by President Donald Trump are demanding Trump unblock their clients, accusing the president of violating their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe @realDonaldTrump account blocked the two users this year after they posted tweets mocking and criticizing the president, the lawyers say.\n\n\"This Twitter account operates as a 'designated public forum' for First Amendment purposes, and accordingly the viewpoint-based blocking of our clients is unconstitutional,\" the nonprofit Knight First Amendment Institute wrote in a letter to Trump on Tuesday. \n\n\"We ask that you unblock them and any others who have been blocked for similar reasons,\" it said.\n\nOne of the users cited in the letter, Holly O'Reilly, had her account blocked after posting a series of replies to one of Trump's tweets last month, according to the letter.\n\nIn one tweet, she promoted the March for Truth, an anti-Trump protest she said she helped organize. In another, she posted a GIF of Pope Francis appearing uncomfortable standing next to Trump, with the caption, \"This is pretty much how the whole world sees you.\"\n\nThe other user, Joe Papp, was blocked for a tweet of his that contained the hashtag \"#fakeleader,\" the institute said.\n\nIn a statement, Knight Institute executive director Jameel Jaffer acknowledged the uncharted legal territory his letter was entering.\n\n\"Though the architects of the Constitution surely didn’t contemplate presidential Twitter accounts, they understood that the President must not be allowed to banish views from public discourse simply because he finds them objectionable,\" Jaffer said.\n\n\"Having opened this forum to all comers, the President can’t exclude people from it merely because he dislikes what they’re saying.\"\n\nWhether the Knight Institute's argument would stand a chance in court is a matter for debate — and First Amendment attorneys are split on the issue.\n\nPart of the issue hinges on whether Trump's personal social media account amounts to a government-designated public forum, like an open city-hall meeting. The Knight Institute said in its letter that its arguments also apply to the president's official @POTUS account.\n\n\"Frankly, I think that's somewhat of an open question that needs to be resolved by the courts,\" First Amendment lawyer Lisa Zycherman of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP told Business Insider.\n\n\"Once you become an elected official, your social media account is by an extension a forum for your constituents to engage with you,\" she said.\n\nBut Marc Randazza, a First Amendment lawyer with the Randazza Legal Group, said a president's social media account isn't a public forum, making the Knight Institute's argument meritless.\n\n\"I'm very expansionist when it comes to First Amendment rights,\" Randazza told Business Insider. \"But this is a little bit of an overreach to say it's a First Amendment violation to block a critic on Twitter.\"\n\nRandazza also countered the comparison of Trump's Twitter account to a town hall, opting for a different metaphor for the president's actions.\n\n\"If somebody was talking to him and he stuck his fingers in his ears and said, 'La la la, I'm not listening to you,' that's not a First Amendment violation either,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't have a right to be listened to. You have a right to speak,\" he said.\n\nIn a message to the Wall Street Journal, Ken Paulson, dean of media and entertainment at Middle Tennessee State University, called the Knight Institute's argument \"novel and ambitious,\" but admitted it was \"a tough sell\" legally.\n\n\"I do think municipalities that establish Facebook pages and invite citizen input are in fact establishing public forums, but I’m not sure that Donald Trump’s brief bursts of opinion are the same thing,\" he said, according to The Journal."],[8,"@CloudExpo @Cloudistics #DX #DataCenter","Download Slide Deck: ▸ Here\n\nDownload Slide Deck: ▸ Here\n\nThe Need for the Public Cloud Alternative\n\nYou know you need the cloud, but you're hesitant to simply dump everything at Amazon since you know that not all workloads are suitable for cloud.

Cancer tumours also shed this information, known as circulating tumour DNA.\n\nExperts are already able to tailor treatments for people with late stages of cancer by analysing this DNA, as larger amounts of it in the blood signify a more advanced disease.\n\nBut, in a new step, they are now working to harness this knowledge to create a test specifically for early-stage disease in people who appear healthy.\n\nAmong the academic and commercial efforts underway to develop reliable blood screening for cancer is that of US firm Grail, which is backed by £77.5m of funding from Bill Gates and Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and has set a goal of introducing such a test by 2019.\n\nThe hope is that people could have the test in their GP surgery as part of an annual health check, alongside monitoring of their blood pressure or cholesterol. Those that are found to have cancer could then have surgery or other treatment, potentially preventing thousands of deaths.\n\nOne issue to overcome was that of the test returning some false positives, where people are thought to have cancer when they do not, said Dr Turner.\n\nFor example, as people get older, their cells naturally shed genetic mutation information into the blood but not all these people will develop cancer.\n\n”Working out how you can develop assays that accurately predict who's got cancer and who will go on to get cancer is a real challenge,” he said.\n\n“It's clearly going to be many years until the assays come through but a large number of biotech firms are devoting a substantial amount of money so I think we should be very optimistic that they will come through and the challenge of false positives will be overcome.”\n\nOne new study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago was on 124 patients with advanced breast, lung, and prostate cancers.\n\nIn 89 per cent of patients, at least one genetic change detected in the tumour was also detected in circulating tumour DNA in the blood.\n\nThe test scanned a very broad area of the human genome, or complete DNA set – comprising 508 genes and more than two million base pairs, or letters, of the genome – with high accuracy.\n\nLead study author Pedram Razavi, who received funding from Grail and is from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSK) in New York, said the test was the most advanced to date and the results of the study were “very promising”.\n\nHe added: “This study is also an important step in the process of developing blood tests for early detection of cancer.”\n\nIn a second study presented at ASCO on 199 patients with pancreatic cancer, detectable circulating tumour DNA was found in 56 per cent of them. This included 43 per cent of those with the earliest stage of disease.\n\nPeter Gibbs, associate professor of medical oncology at the Royal Melbourne and Western Hospitals in Australia, who worked on the study, said he thought an early cancer blood test was three to five years away.\n\n“You'd have your cholesterol check, your blood sugar check and DNA check at the same time. That's what I would envisage happening,” he added.\n\nAdditional reporting from Press Association"],[8,"Putin paid Trump? Republicans think McCarthy’s statement has to be a joke.","Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s Republican colleagues were ready Wednesday to accept the House majority leader’s explanation that he was joking in his private comments last year suggesting that then-candidate Donald Trump was being paid by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“It was a bad attempt at a joke,” McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Wednesday evening, moments after The Washington Post published an account of the remark based on a recording of a June 2016 meeting of GOP leaders. “That’s all there is to it. Nobody believes it to be true.”\n\nAmong those willing to give the Californian a pass was another GOP figure whom McCarthy identified as possibly being on Putin’s payroll: Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.).\n\nMcCarthy found Rohrabacher on the House floor Wednesday evening and assured him the remark captured on the recording obtained by the Post — “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” McCarthy said — was not to be taken seriously.\n\nRohrabacher agreed and compared the situation to a lunge at humor that had haunted him for years.\n\n“You have to be very careful when you’re using humor,” Rohrabacher said in a short interview Wednesday evening. “I remember that I was trying to make fun of the scientists who claimed that cow flatulence make global warming. So at a hearing, I said, ‘Oh, do you think the dinosaurs disappeared because of dinosaur flatulence?’ ”\n\n“To this day, you have these environmental wackos saying ‘Dana Rohrabacher believes that flatulence killed the dinosaurs,’ ” he added. “It was humor, but you’ve got to watch out for it. Kevin didn’t mean any harm.”\n\nThe meeting included House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who swore its attendees to secrecy by saying they were all “family” and should not leak the contents of the discussion.\n\nTwo of the GOP leaders who were in the room with McCarthy last June said Wednesday they did not recall the majority leader’s remark.\n\n“No, but I’ll review my notes,” said Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), the chief deputy whip.\n\n“I never heard him say that,” House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) told reporters.\n\nOther Republicans, meanwhile, flatly dismissed McCarthy’s comment as misunderstood humor.\n\n“It had to be a joke,” said Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.). “I just can’t imagine he’d say something like that seriously. I wouldn’t put any credibility in that statement being what he actually thinks.”\n\nSaid Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.), a close friend of McCarthy’s, explained, “With Kevin, he does have a sense of humor, and so it wouldn’t surprise me for him to joke about. This one I can’t comment on. But we joke with each other all day long.”\n\nOne GOP member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly, was skeptical that McCarthy would have any special knowledge of Putin’s activities.\n\n“There is no way Kevin McCarthy had that kind of intel up here on the Hill,” the member said. “It’s just a joke.”\n\nSome Democrats, however, had a different reaction.\n\n“I want to hear the recording,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who has called for a more vigorous probe of Trump’s ties to Russia. “What’s concerning to me is, if it was said, they had their own concerns, and so far have done nothing to address concerns about the president’s ties to Russia.”\n\n“Did he have knowledge of a relationship that the president had with Russia, and did he pass that along to anyone? And if he did have knowledge, why have we not acted?” Swalwell asked of McCarthy. “We have a responsibility as a coequal branch of government to investigate this.”\n\nA spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also noted the disconnect between McCarthy’s comment and the GOP’s public posture at the time he made it.\n\n“For weeks last summer, Russia’s hacking of our democratic institutions yielded only silence from these Republican leaders,” said the spokesman, Drew Hammill. “Apparently, Leader McCarthy could only be bothered to speak out from the comforts of a private backroom in the Capitol.”\n\nBut other Democrats didn’t quite know what to make of the report.\n\n“That one has to sink in for a while,” said Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), another member of the intelligence panel.\n\n“We almost made it through a day without a major breaking story,” said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.). “But, no, we’re not making it to cocktail hour.”\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee’s ranking Democrat, said it “fits in the category of surreal.”\n\n“But probably the most surreal is the fact that you have Vladimir Putin vouching for the president of the United States about something that took place in the Oval Office,” he added, referring to Putin’s Wednesday offer to release “records” of his envoys’ meeting with Trump last week.\n\nRohrabacher made his joke about dinosaur flatulence 10 years ago, during a hearing on climate change that took place shortly after Democrats won back the House. A climate-change skeptic, Rohrabacher asked a group of scientists if they could really, with confidence, say why atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were higher in the Paleocene-Eocene era.\n\n“We don’t know what those other cycles were caused by in the past,” he said. “Could be dinosaur flatulence, you know, or who knows? We do know the CO2 in the past had its time when it was greater as well.”\n\nSince then, Rohrabacher has been reelected easily. But in 2016, for the first time, his district voted for the Democrats’ presidential candidate, picking Hillary Clinton over President Trump by 1.7 points. Democrats have for the first time worked hard to recruit a credible challenger, and the climate story has been part of their argument.\n\nThat challenger, businessman Harley Rouda, issued a statement late Wednesday calling for a federal probe based on McCarthy’s remark.\n\n“Dana Rohrabacher’s devout support of and advocacy for Russia’s brutal regime is widely known, and given the ongoing investigation of Trump’s possible collusion with Russia in the 2016 election along with Rohrabacher’s deep ties to Trump, it’s become abundantly clear that this spider web of ties must be investigated,” Rouda said.\n\nEd O’Keefe and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report."],[8,"A crisis within a crisis: Refugees in Lesbos","Lesbos, Greece - Upstairs in the Blue Star hotel, Iman* cooks a large pasta dish and makes tea; a luxury after going without her own stove for more than a year. After dinner, the Alsamaray family* disperses.\n\nKhalil, Iman's husband, catches up on the latest news from the family's hometown of Mosul, Iraq. Jamil, 13, goes out, while his sisters Amani and Aliya, 10-year-old twins, lie in bed and watch YouTube videos until they fall asleep.\n\nThe family had lived for 10 months in an overcrowded migrant centre in Lesbos, Greece until January, when they moved in to the hotel as part of a United Nations initiative to place vulnerable refugees in better housing during the winter.\n\nSince 2015, more than a million refugees have come through Greece, often on their way to western Europe. Like the Alsamarays, thousands remain stranded until their asylum claims are processed; they find themselves in a crisis within a crisis, fleeing violence only to often spend more than a year in a country stretched thin over the past decade by a financial crisis.\n\nWhile their refugee guests dine upstairs, the Makris family tries to wind down after a long day. They clear the table from the catering delivered to feed asylum seekers and hotel owner Dimitrios Makris fields calls. There's a long list of tasks to be completed in time for the tourist season, even if in recent years fewer tourists have been arriving.\n\nAt a time of unprecedented economic strife when Greeks are struggling to get by, the refugee crisis adds to the pressure on Greece - while also providing some locals with much-needed income.\n\nInside these crises, the Alsamarays and the Makrises each fight to survive. Both families know that life can be upended overnight and what it means to be exiled, and both fear their best days are behind them. But, at least for a moment, under one roof, they also give each other what they desperately need: a measure of stability among the uncertainty.\n\nAmani and Aliya are typical pre-teens, sassy and busy developing their sense of style. They love pinks and purples, wear skinny pants, and worry about their long brown hair being messed up after wearing a hat.\n\nAnd they love Mytilini, the capital of Lesbos about 10 kilometres from their home at the Blue Star hotel.\n\n\"We love the people, the shopping, the coffee,\" Aliya says. Although the twins complain they hardly visit because their parents won't let them go alone.\n\nAs the girls adapt to their new world, their parents look to their old lives.\n\n\"In Iraq, we had jobs, my house was good, and we had a car,\" says 33-year-old Iman. She was a preschool teacher and Khalil was a mechanic.\n\nBut after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) took over Mosul - Iraq's second city - in 2014, everything changed. \"Women had to be covered all in black; men couldn't smoke; if you were Christian or another religion, you had to convert.\"\n\nA year later, ISIL executed one of Khalil's brothers in the middle of the street, accusing him of defying ISIL rules about travelling to Baghdad, and forced the family to watch.\n\nIn February 2016, the Alsamarays fled to Turkey, intent on finally reaching Sweden, where another of Khalil's brothers has sought asylum.\n\nAfter multiple attempts to cross, and a one-month stint in Turkish detention, they arrived in Lesbos nearly two months later.\n\nGreece represented a new life. When their rubber boat reached Lesbos, Iman cried because she thought they were going to be safe. \"I forgot the fear when I saw Greece,\" she says.\n\nBut as days turned into months at the refugee camp near the village of Moria, that happiness turned into despair.\n\nMoria camp - a former prison surrounded by chain-link fences and barbed wire - was initially a reception centre to process migrants and asylum seekers, but it became a long-term housing facility. There was no privacy in the crowded centre; the Alsamarays shared a room with six other families. \n\nKhalil was afraid for the family's safety and Iman was always sick. With little to keep people busy, many of the men drink to pass the time. Frustrated locals complain of petty theft. There have been fires and sometimes fights break out.\n\nHuman rights groups note a rise in suicide attempts and self-harming in the housing facilities, including by children. In January, Iman was at the doctor's when her neighbours brought in her daughter Aliya. She had tried to kill herself with a knife.\n\n\"She witnessed the brutal killing of her uncle in Iraq and has serious suicidal thoughts, weight loss, depression and suicidal attempts,\" a doctor’s note from January 17 reads. She needed immediate care and \"a safe place to live\".\n\nEvery time Aliya saw people leave the camp for Athens or another country, she cried, Iman says - afraid that, if they weren't leaving, it meant they would be deported and that she would have to face ISIL again.\n\nEven now, just driving by the camp is a trigger. \"Please don't take me to Moria, please don't take me to Moria,\" Aliya pleads if they pass the camp.\n\nMoving to the hotel meant they have the sea in their backyard, a park and a puppy to play with.\n\nInside the small hotel studio, the twins decorated the headboard of their bed with stickers and lined it with stuffed animals. In the other room, they have their own kitchen and table where the family can eat together and a private bathroom.\n\nThe twins also picked up fishing. Every morning they run to the back of the hotel, retrieve spools of fishing line hidden in the rocky harbour, and mix old pitta bread softened with sweet milk which they use as bait.\n\nAs the twins fish, they glimpse the snow-capped mountains in Turkey, where they pray never to return, and the ferries heading to Athens, where they hope their journey to a new life will begin.\n\nAmani and Aliya are enjoying a bit of normality, but the Blue Star isn't home and the Alsamarays have learned over the past few years that circumstances can switch in a moment.\n\nA lesson many Greeks know all too well.\n\nFor Dimitrios and his family it was never a question of whether they should host refugees.\n\nWhile some hotel owners worried about the wear and tear in the rooms or a potential backlash from tourists, for the Makrises it was a humanitarian issue.\n\nForty-seven-year-old Dimitrios' grandparents fled their home in 1923, when more than a million Greeks were expelled from Turkey and nearly half a million Muslims were sent the other way.\n\nWhile they were growing up, Dimitrios and Toula heard stories about their grandparents; how they had lost their transportation business between Greece and Turkey, a big ship and a large home; how they arrived in Germany with only a small suitcase.\n\nForty years later, Dimitrios' parents had to leave Greece to become guest workers in Germany, where they lived for 15 years, raised their daughter Toula, had Dimitrios, and slowly built up hotels in Lesbos. Before the economic crisis, Dimitrios and his family had expanded their business ventures in Lesbos, including other hotels, a restaurant by the sea, a nightclub, an internet cafe, and a crepe shop.\n\nBecause Lesbos traditionally relied mostly on Greek tourists visiting the island's historic churches and thermal springs, when the economy tanked, Lesbos was one of the first places to be hit, as many tourists - Greek and foreign - stopped coming.\n\n\"It was like a domino effect,\" says Dimitrios. \"Every year we would put more money into the businesses because we expected things would be better the following year, but things only got worse.\"\n\nIn 2009, he closed the nightclub. Other businesses followed one by one until 2011, when Dimitrios and his wife Michelle left for Germany to find work that would keep the family's two hotels open; finding jobs as waiters in a banquet hall in Frankfurt. They returned to Greece last year to help run the hotel business again.\n\nWhen refugees recently started arriving in Lesbos, the family opened their doors. They invited refugees inside to rest, they made them cups of tea and fed them.\n\nThe already hard conditions in the camp became worse in the harsh winter. Some people sleeping in tents burned cardboard, plastic and scraps of wood inside the tents for warmth. In November, a woman and child died after a gas canister attached to a hot plate exploded inside their tent. In January, another three men would die and a fourth was left in critical condition in another incident - the cause of death is not yet clear.\n\nWhen snow fell in January, Dimitrios drove to the camp in Moria to pick up families and take them to the hotel.\n\nSince January, the Blue Star has hosted 60 people through the UNHCR and the Greek non-profit Iliaktida. The UN pays between 20 and 28 euros ($21.8 and $30.6) per person per day, depending on the type of catering. While it helped offset some of the losses from tourism, Dimitrios says it is still a relatively small amount of money.\n\nDimitrios says he is not sure how much longer he can afford to stay, as Greece remains mired in economic strife and the tourists remain scarce. Yet another Greek default may loom, while there is little sign that austerity will be eased. Perhaps he will have to return to Germany again to work.\n\nFrom one side of the hotel, thick olive groves dot the landscape. On the other, there is deep blue sea.\n\n\"I want to stay here, but how can I find the money?\" asks Dimitrios.\n\nInside the Blue Star hotel, both families say they consider each other friends. But the language barrier keeps them from really getting to know one another.\n\nAs much as Greeks sympathise with refugees, still they see them as different. The refugees have usually heard about Greece's economic troubles, but to them it is abstract. They look around and all they see are people who have what they don't.\n\nMany Greeks worry about the impact of refugees. Since 2015, the municipality of Lesbos has spent more than five million euros ($5.5m) on refugee-related expenses, a source in the Ministry of Digital Policy, Telecommunications and Media told Al Jazeera. Lesbos municipality opened a cemetery, a migrant centre to house asylum seekers, and the hospital had to take thousands more patients.\n\nSome locals are also concerned about what will happen as the refugees move on. Fewer people are coming since the EU-Turkey deal. The number of refugees stranded in Lesbos dropped to below 3,000. While placing refugees in hotels was only a temporary solution, hotel owners in places such as Mytilini or other cities where migrants are hosted also benefited from the aid workers and government officials who came to help.\n\nPlacing refugees in hotels is only a temporary solution, and asylum seekers are being sent to apartments, to the mainland or to other migrant centres; hosting refugees is not a long-term business model.\n\n\"The future is investments from the Greek government to renovate the thermal baths, to encourage investment,\" says Dimitrios' wife Michelle.\n\nThe refugees are meant to leave Dimitrios' hotel as the UN refugee agency's programme is ending; the Alsamarays are supposed to go to Kara Tepe, a camp ran by the municipality of Lesbos.\n\nThe UN's refugee agency says Kara Tepe offers a safe environment for families.\"The conditions at the facility are adequate and services are available on site, including medical and psychosocial support,\" spokesman Leo Dobb says. The bathrooms are shared, though, and Iman will have to give up her stove.\n\nThe family refuses to go. Iman says they feel that her daughter's psychological concerns should have been enough to get the family transferred to an apartment.\n\n\"I cannot continue to see my children in this situation,\" Iman says. \"I'm tired.\"\n\n*The 'Alsamaray' family have been given pseudonyms to protect their children's identities."],[8,"These Are The Victims Of The Portland Train Stabbing Attack","Ricky Best, 53, and Taliesin Namkai-Meche, 23, were killed when they tried to stop a man hurling abuse at two women of Muslim appearance, police said. Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, was injured but expected to survive.\n\nstabbed Two men were stabbed to death and another man was injured on a commuter train in Portland, Oregon, Friday night, after they tried to intervene as a man shouted hate speech at two young women who appeared to be Muslim. On Saturday, police identified Ricky John Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, as the victims who were killed in the attack. Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, was identified as the third passenger who was stabbed. He is currently being treated at a hospital for serious injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening. A 35-year-old white supremacist, Jeremy Christian, has been charged with two counts of aggravated murder, two counts of second-degree intimidation, and being a felon in possession of a restricted weapon. Share On email Share On email Share On link Share On link Share This Link Share On facebook Share On facebook\n\nRachel Macy told The Oregonian that she was on the train when the suspect boarded and began shouting racist remarks. She recalled Best standing close to Christian, trying to calm him down, and Namkai-Meche telling him to leave the train. Macy said the three victims — Best, Namkai-Meche, and Fletcher — appeared to be blocking Christian from the girls, the targets of his rant. She recalled the stunning moment when Christian attacked Namkai-Meche. \"It was just a swift, hard hit,'' she said. \"It was a nightmare.'' Macy said that she stayed with Namkai-Meche, who stumbled past her, blood-soaked and pale, until help arrived. She said that she told him to lie down, continued to tell him he wasn’t alone, and prayed. \"Tell everyone on this train I love them,” Macy said Namkai-Meche told her, before the medics took him away on a stretcher. Namkai-Meche graduated from Portland's Reed College in 2016 with a degree in economics. He was interning for the Cadmus Group, a consulting company, at the time of his death. His sister, Vajra Alaya-Maitreya, told BuzzFeed News that Namkai-Meche \"lived a joyous and full life\" and that \"his enthusiasm was infectious.\" \"We lost him in a senseless act that brought close to home the insidious rift of prejudice and intolerance that is too familiar, too common,\" said Alaya-Maitreya. \"He was resolute in his conduct and respect of all people. In his final act of bravery, he held true to what he believed is the way forward.\" \"He will live in our hearts forever as the just, brave, loving, hilarious, and beautiful soul he was,\" said Alaya-Maitreya. \"We ask that in honor of his memory, we use this tragedy as an opportunity for reflection and change. We choose love. \"Safe journey, Taliesin. We love you.\"\n\nNamkai-Meche's mother, Asha Deliverance, first announced that he was one of the victims in a Facebook post Saturday. \"Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, My dear baby boy passed on yesterday while protecting two young Muslim girls from a racist man on the train in Portland,\" she wrote. \"He was a hero and will remain a hero on the other side of the veil. Shining bright star I love you forever.\"\n\nEllie Lawrence, Namkai-Meche's girlfriend, told BuzzFeed News that her boyfriend was the \"kindest, purest, most amazing person\" she'd ever met. \"I will follow you on your journey through the sun and the moon and the stars. I will love you eternally,\" she wrote on Facebook, sharing a photo of the two of them. The family will hold a vigil for Namkai-Meche on Saturday night at 6:30 p.m. in Portland, near the station where he died.\n\nBest was a city employee, Army veteran, and father of four, according to The Oregonian. He served 23 years in the military as a platoon sergeant for Corps maintenance, retiring in 2012. In 2014, he made an unsuccessful attempt to run for Clackamas County commissioner. “I can’t stand by and do nothing,” Best said of his decision to run for local politics, according to The Oregonian's profile on his candidacy. At the time of his death, he was working as supervisor in Portland's Bureau of Development Services. Best was a lifelong Oregon resident and was heading home to his three teenage sons and 12-year-old daughter in Happy Valley when he was killed.\n\nMicah David-Cole Fletcher, a student at Portland State University, was also stabbed in the attack but is expected to survive. As of Saturday evening, he was being treated for serious injuries. Friends of the 21-year-old told BuzzFeed News that although they were shocked to learn Fletcher was injured in the attack, they were not surprised he stepped in to stand up for someone else. \"I was shocked it was him, but I wasn't surprised it was him,\" Elie Hoover, 24, said. \"I can't see him not standing up.\" Hoover said Fletcher is \"deeply empathetic\" and is often defending others against transgressions, small and large. \"Whether its someone cutting in line, or doesn't tip, or if it's something big like someone being overtly racist,\" she said.\n\nMandela Cordeta, 26, said he's known Fletcher for about 10 years, after they met at an arts camp. Since then, she said, Fletcher has been deeply involved in poetry and music and currently plays the drums. In 2013, he won a poetry slam contest for a poem condemning prejudice against Muslims. Recently, friends said Fletcher has also gotten involved in marches and protests around Portland, becoming active against what he views as social injustices. \"If there's a march or protest happening, he's the one calling me to see where I'm at,\" Cordeta said. \"He's always showing up.\" \"He's just against injustice, that's his personality,\" Cordeta added. At least two GoFundMe campaigns have been set up to assist all three victims' families with costs related to their deaths and injuries. As of Sunday night, the campaigns had raised more than $500,000. The Bilal Mosque in Beaverton, Oregon, has also set up a fund for the victims' families. Have you been the victim of a hate crime? Tell us about it so we can investigate."],[8,"The hidden problem: mental health in construction","The construction industry is renowned for being the sector with the greatest number of fatalities and major injuries but even more working days are lost to work-related ill health. How much of this is mental ill health? Andrew Christodoulou investigates.\n\nThe latest figures from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) show that for 2015/16 there were 43 fatal injuries to workers in construction. The industry accounts for 27% of fatal accidents to employees and 10% of all major injuries which occur each year.\n\nHowever the industry is also responsible for high levels of sickness. According to the HSE, each year some 4% of workers in construction suffer from a work-related illness. Around 79,000 workers report an illness each year and over a million working days are lost each year in construction due to work-related illnesses. Every year more working days are lost in construction due to work-related illness than due to injuries caused by accidents. The statistics tell us that construction is a high-risk industry for health issues as well as for safety-related matters.\n\nHidden in the statistics relating to health is a surprising figure; of the estimated 79,000 cases of reported illness in the construction industry, 18% of these relate to stress, depression or anxiety —amounting to 400,000 days lost each year.\n\nThe HSE has recognised the issue of stress in construction for some time. In 2007 it published Research Report RR518 An Analysis of the Prevalence and Distribution of Stress in the Construction Industry.\n\nThe report suggests reasons for the presence of stress in construction and recommends actions on how to deal with it. The report also looks at the prevalence of suicide in construction and an abstract for the report gives an impression of the extent of the problem at that time.\n\nToday, suicide is increasingly an issue for construction. Work-related suicide statistics are not officially recorded in the UK, but research suggests that in the construction sector, workers could be 10 times more likely to die by suicide than from on-site accidents.\n\nIn Australia where suicide in construction has been recognised for some time, the statistics around suicide in the construction industry are shocking. According to Mates in Construction, a charity set up in Australia in 2008 to address the issue, construction workers are more than twice as likely to commit suicide as other people in Australia and six times more likely to die by suicide than through a workplace accident, and apprentices in construction are two and a half times more likely to commit suicide than other young men their age.\n\nSo what makes the construction industry so prone to stress, anxiety, depression and suicide? How can it be managed? How can workers be helped?\n\nThe Special Factors of the Construction Industry The workforce in the construction sector is predominantly male, and has a particular range of factors recognised as likely stressors. The construction industry is a tough competitive industry. It has targets and deadlines for completion of projects with financial penalties for delays and late completion. Many workers in construction feel the pressure and tension of having to compete to reach the production targets that have been set. They can be held personally responsible for any delays which may occur. Their jobs may depend on meeting the deadlines. Financial penalties can affect their income. Physical conditions on most sites are tough and extremely dynamic and may change constantly. There can be additional pressures from the weather, wind, rain, hail and snow adding to difficult working conditions. Sites can be noisy and overbearing with plant and machinery on the move. Meeting deadlines can be more challenging in such circumstances. Many workers in construction have to travel away from their homes to work, which could involve long daily travel distances and many staying away from home. Loneliness can be a significant factor for many construction workers, contributing to their stress, depression and anxiety. Most workers in construction are self-employed, working from contract to contract and to this extent job security is fragile and uncertain. This perception of job insecurity is another important stressor. The work itself is often dangerous and testing and working against strict deadlines under pressure can make adhering to safe working procedures difficult. Some workers are consequently anxious about their own wellbeing while on site. Apart from the risk of accidents there is often a risk of exposure to hazardous substances such as asbestos and silica and workers can experience stress and anxiety where they believe they may have been exposed to such hazardous substances and where development of a disease may take many years. Some workers have the added responsibility for the health and safety of others. The industry is also known for its macho image. This means some workers may be reluctant to admit to stress, depression or anxiety and so may not seek or receive the help they need. The nature of the industry may also lend itself to bullying and harassment.\n\nDealing with Stress, Depression, Anxiety and Suicide in Construction The Health and Safety at Work, etc Act 1974 requires employers to ensure the health and safety of their employees and also third parties who might be affected by the employer’s activities. This general duty extends to stress, anxiety and depression caused by work. But it is often not considered in the construction sector where site hazards such as working at height are seen as a higher priority. The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 provide a framework for dealing with health and safety risks and issues for the duration of a project. The Construction Phase Health and Safety Plan sets out the risks and how they will be managed. It is however rare for such plans to consider stress and wellbeing for workers on site. The HSE’s Stress Management Standards can be used to assess and manage stress, anxiety and depression on site. The measures needed in this respect can be incorporated into the construction phase health and safety plan for each project. This may involve for example wellbeing programmes, training for managers and others on how to deal with stress, and worker access to counselling and helplines. A number of support groups and charities have come together to provide information including training programmes to promote mental health and wellbeing in construction. One such is Mates in Mind, a charitable programme set up by the Health in Construction Leadership Group (HCLG) with the support of the British Safety Council that aims to raise awareness and understanding of poor mental health in the construction sector. The charity provides help and support for those suffering mental health issues as well as practical advice for employers. Its stated purpose is to bring the industry together to openly talk and address the stigma associated with mental ill health and is based on the Australian Mates in Construction model."],[8,"Ruth and BBC Scotland – The real coalition – Towards Indyref2…","What an election.  Corbyn confounded his detractors and gave Theresa May a run for her money.\n\nThe Conservatives have lost their House of Commons majority.  Theresa May is a dead woman walking.  Her party is now reduced to seeking the backing of the Democratic Unionist Party in order to form a working government.  That’s Unionism.\n\nIn Scotland the big story was the widely expected gains for the Scottish Conservatives.  Former SNP leader Alex Salmond lost his seat as did the SNP leader at Westminster Angus Robertson.\n\nPete Wishart held on by the skin of his teeth – just twenty one votes, whilst Stephen Gethins held on by an unprecedented two votes. There were unexpected gains for the Scottish Labour party.  The Corbyn effect has pumped breath into the Scottish Labour corpse.\n\nOverall the SNP lost twenty one of its seats to the combined efforts of the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems.  It felt like a disaster.  It felt like a loss.  Indyref2 is dead according to the BBC.\n\nBut hold on.  To use boxing parlance, our man was knocked down a few times but he got back up, battered his opponent black-and-blue and achieved a unanimous points win.  The SNP, despite facing the dual onslaught of British Nationalist tactical voting and a Corbyn surge, maintained its majority.\n\nThe 2015 result that witnessed fifty six seats going to the SNP was a post-indyref fluke.  It could never be repeated.  This general election was merely the expected levelling out, some shock defeats notwithstanding.\n\nAnd what of the state broadcaster?\n\nAs John Swinney rightly pointed out, Nicola Sturgeon also had to contend with a BBC which in Scotland turned this general election into a mid-term Holyrood election.\n\nThe SNP found itself relentlessly pressed on issues that had nothing to do with Westminster.  Voters reacted accordingly.\n\nThe BBC has had a great deal of influence in the Scottish outcome of this general election.  I myself highlighted the state broadcaster’s obsession with the constituency of Moray and the benefits to Unionists of the high-profile coverage given Unionist ‘target seats’.  I’ve also noted the absolute refusal of the BBC and the rest of our media to pursue Ruth Davidson who lied her way through the campaign.\n\nRuth ran an effective if basic campaign.  She appealed to raw British Nationalism.  She used the council elections to push her general election message of no to indyref2.  BBC Scotland played its part by insisting indyref2 was the single-most important issue in Scotland.  It didn’t matter what Nicola Sturgeon said, the BBC was always going to run with Ruth Davidson’s inspired narrative.\n\nIt’s true that there is opposition to a second referendum, but there is also support.  Remember the reasons for Indyref2 making its sooner than expected appearance was Scotland being dragged out of the EU against our will.  Hard Brexit is still lurking in the background.\n\nSo where does it leave us?  The SNP, I repeat, won this election in Scotland.  Nicola Sturgeon said a majority of Westminster seats would be seen as a ‘triple lock’ for a second independence referendum.  Her party achieved this majority.  She needs to honour this manifesto commitment.  To roll back on her manifesto pledge will effectively send a message to the electorate that the Unionists did indeed win.\n\nTheresa May is mortally wounded.  The Tory party at Westminster has been weakened.  Now is not the time for the SNP to appear on the back-foot.  The party must act like the winners they are.  Come out swinging.\n\nThe First Minister needs to continue with her pre-election line of compromise.  Scotland voted to remain in the European Union.  Nicola Sturgeon should quickly reiterate her demand for EU Single Market membership.  No membership means Indyref2 is absolutely still on the table.  Anything else would be seen as capitulation.\n\nThe elephant in the SNP room is of course BBC Scotland.  It remains a corrupt pro-Union entity.\n\nPacific Quay very deliberately sought to confuse Scottish voters by shoe-horning devolved issues into every debate and discussion.  A single report on Scottish education became the motif for the BBC’s Scottish campaign.\n\nThe SNP found itself defending its Holyrood record.  Ruth Davidson and the other Unionist leaders made hay.\n\nBBC Scotland continues to be the problem the SNP will not address.  That said, the party cannot directly challenge the state broadcaster’s claims of impartiality.  The corrupt BBC and its corrupt media allies would present the nationalists as bitter ‘losers’ looking to blame a trusted media outlet.\n\nWhat the independence movement needs is a separatecampaign group, a think-tank if you like, whose job it would be to highlight the excesses of Pacific Quay. And there are excesses.\n\nOn the question of the constitution we witnessed three voices against one.  The SNP were outnumbered in every debate and discussion.  The public was presented with a non-stop crescendo of ‘divisive referendum’ sound-bites.  Even now with Nicola Sturgeon’s party having achieved a second majority of Scottish Westminster seats, the defeated Unionists are hogging the airwaves with a three-to-one advantage.\n\nBBC Scotland needs to be challenged by people with the gravitas to mount such a challenge.  We need senior figures within the Yes movement to come together on this.  The independence movement needs to mount a highly visible challenge to BBC Scotland.  We may be running out of time.\n\nViews: 7223"],[8,"Why Would Aliens Even Bother with Earth?","As an astrobiologist I spend a lot of my time working in the lab with samples from some of the most extreme places on Earth, investigating how life might survive on other worlds in our solar system and what signs of their existence we could detect. If there is biology beyond the Earth, the vast majority of life in the Galaxy will be microbial—hardy single-celled life forms that tolerate a much greater range of conditions than more complex organisms can. To be honest, my own point of view is pretty pessimistic. Don’t get me wrong—if the Earth received an alien tweet tomorrow, or some other text message beamed at us by radio or laser pulse, then I’d be absolutely thrilled. So far, though, we’ve seen no convincing evidence of other civilizations among the stars in our skies.\n\nBut let’s say, just for the sake of argument, that there are one or more star-faring alien civilizations in the Milky Way. We’re all familiar with Hollywood’s darker depictions of what aliens might do when they come to the Earth: zapping the White House, harvesting humanity for food like a herd of cattle, or sucking our oceans dry. These scenarios make great films, but don’t really stand up to rational scrutiny. So let’s run through a thought experiment on what reasons aliens might possibly have to visit the Earth, not because I reckon we need to ready our defenses or assemble a welcoming party, but because I think considering these possibilities is a great way of exploring many of the core themes of the science of astrobiology.\n\nAliens come to Earth to enslave humanity or for breeding partners\n\nAlien races enslaving each other is a common trope of many science fiction universes. While enslavement of defeated enemies or other vulnerable populations has regrettably been a common feature of our history on Earth, it’s hard to see why a species with the capability of voyaging between the stars, and therefore having already demonstrated the mastery of a highly advanced level of machinery and of marshaling energy resources, would have any need for slaves. Constructing robots, or other forms of automation or mechanization, would be a far more effective solution for labor—people are feeble in comparison, harder to fix, and need to be fed.\n\nLikewise, the idea of an alien species needing humans for breeding doesn’t really stand up to scrutiny. The act of sexual reproduction, on a genetic level, involves the combination of  DNA from two individuals. So on the most fundamental level, for an alien race to be compatible with us, they would need not only to use the same polymer, deoxyribonucleic acid, as the storage molecule for their genetic information, but also to use the same four “letters” for their genetic alphabet (and not other purine and pyrimidine bases that exist in chemistry), and the same coding system for translating those sequences of genetic letters into proteins, and the same organizational structure of the DNA strands into chromosomes, and so on. There is a lot of ongoing research on whether extraterrestrial life is likely to use DNA, or what molecular alternatives there might be, but it is a huge stretch to expect alien life to be that similar to human genetics. Humans can’t even interbreed with our closest evolutionary relatives on Earth, the chimpanzees (indeed, this is the basis of the definition for different species—two organisms which are not able to reproduce fertile offspring), and so it is overwhelmingly improbable that an alien life form from a completely different evolutionary lineage would be compatible.\n\nAliens come to Earth to harvest us for food\n\nIf aliens wouldn’t be bothered about enslaving or breeding with us, might they simply be coming to Earth for a drive-by meal? The question of whether an alien biochemistry would be able to digest us as food actually comes down to some very fundamental features of the molecules of life. Our cells are made up of various organic molecules: proteins (polymers of amino acids), nucleic acids DNA and RNA (polymers of bases and sugars), and membranes of phospholipids. And so for making more cells for reproduction, growth and repair of our bodies we need a source of these simple building blocks. We eat other animals or plants and our digestive system breaks them down into their component amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids, which we then use as the building blocks for ourselves. So in order to derive any useful nutrition from eating a human, an alien monster would need to be based on very similar biochemistry, and thus have the enzymes needed for processing the molecules we are built from.\n\nA whole variety of amino acids, sugars and fatty molecules are actually found in certain meteorites, having been produced by astrochemistry in outer space, and so maybe extraterrestrial life would be based on the same basic building blocks as us. But there’s another, very interesting subtlety here. Simple organic molecules like amino acids and sugars can exist in two different forms, mirror images of each other (in the same way your two hands are similar shapes but can’t be placed exactly one on top of the other). These two versions are known as enantiomers, and it turns out that all life on Earth uses only left-handed amino acids and right-handed sugars, whereas non-living chemistry produces even mixtures of both kinds.\n\nSo if we do find traces of amino acids on Mars, one very good way of telling whether these organic molecules are the relics of ancient Martian life or are just the product of astrochemistry would be to check if they are mostly left- or right-handed forms, or just an even mixture. The most exciting discovery would be to detect traces of ancient bacteria on Mars and to find that they employ the opposite forms of organic molecules to us: right-handed amino acids or left-handed sugars, because then we would know for sure that this life was definitely extraterrestrial and not merely contamination from Earth. So here’s a fascinating thought: alien invaders could be based on exactly the same organic molecules (amino acids, sugars, etc.), but they still wouldn’t gain any nutrition from eating us as the origins of life on their own planet settled on the opposite enantiomers. We’d be mirror images of each other, on a molecular level.\n\nAliens come to Earth to suck our oceans dry\n\nIf alien marauders would need to have an essentially identical biochemistry to bother culling us for food, maybe they come to Earth to harvest some other vital substance. All life on Earth is water-based; H2O is astonishingly versatile as a solvent and participant in biochemistry and so it seems likely that extraterrestrial life would also be based on this compound. Perhaps, then, aliens may be drawn to the Earth for our wonderfully wet oceans and seas and rivers and lakes—to siphon off our hydrological cycle.\n\nThe problem with this supposition is that there are loads of far better sources of water in space. In fact, we think that when Earth first formed from the swirling disc of gas and dust around the proto-Sun it was actually a pretty dry planet; the water to fill our oceans was delivered later by a barrage of comets and asteroids from the colder, outer regions of the solar system. In fact, Europa, one of the moons orbiting Jupiter, contains more liquid water in the global ocean beneath its frozen surface than our entire planet—Europa, and not Earth, is the Waterworld of our solar system. So if you were an alien voyaging between star systems in need of a drink, you’d have access to a far greater amount of water in the icy moons and cometary halo of the outer solar system. You’d also find it much more practical to operate in deep space, rather than trying to suck up the oceans against the gravitational pull of the planet Earth.\n\nAliens come to Earth for some other raw material\n\nIf not water, then maybe there’s some other natural resource that aliens might invade the Earth to exploit. Perhaps they intend to wipe away our cities and begin strip-mining the crust of the planet for ores to extract metals and build more vast spaceships. But in fact, because the Earth formed from a molten state with iron sinking down to the core, our planet’s crust is actually pretty depleted of useful metals like iron, nickel, platinum, tungsten and gold. And as with the water, it’s hard to see why aliens would bother extracting material against the gravity of the Earth when the asteroids are composed of the same basic rocky stuff. In fact, some asteroids are believed to be essentially pure lumps of metal—they were once the cores of protoplanets that were smashed apart again by the colossal collisions in the early history of the solar system. Several companies are already proposing to launch asteroid mining operations to exploit these exceedingly valuable resources.\n\nPerhaps, though, there might be a reason that our hypothetical aliens would come to mine the Earth. While it’s true that the asteroids and Earth, and other terrestrial planets, are made up of essentially the same rocky material, the Earth isn’t simply an inert lump; it’s a very active, dynamic place. In particular, the thin crust of the Earth is fractured into separate shards that are continually sliding around on top of the hot gooey mantle, rubbing alongside each other, crunching head-on, subducting one beneath another, or pulling apart to create fresh crust. This is the churning process of plate tectonics.\n\nSo far, astronomers have already found over four and a half thousand extrasolar planets—worlds orbiting other stars—and the expectation now is that there are billions of rocky planets in our Galaxy. But here’s a thought right on the forefront of current planetary science and astrobiology. Perhaps terrestrial planets are common, but terrestrial planets with plate tectonics are rare. Plate tectonics is thought to be vital for keeping the Earth’s climate stable over billions of years to allow complex life like ours to evolve, and it also acts to concentrate certain metals into rich ores. It seems likely that only a small proportion of terrestrial planets undergo plate tectonics (neither Mars nor Venus does). So perhaps an alien civilization would come to the Earth for our exceptional plate tectonics and concentration of particular metals, and the fact that the same tectonics had also enabled a rich biosphere to develop would be merely an inconvenience.\n\nAliens come to Earth looking for a new home\n\nThere is a considerable amount of rocky real estate in the galaxy for aliens to consider moving home to, but a terrestrial planet might need to offer more than just a habitable zone locale to be able to support complex life. Communities of hardy microbial cells thriving off inorganic energy deep underground might be able to survive pretty much anywhere, but complex life requires much narrower environmental conditions on the surface. Various features of the Earth beyond our warm oceans are thought to be crucial to maintaining a stable surface environment for geological time periods. These include plate tectonics acting to regulate the climate, a large moon preventing the spin axis of the planet from wobbling too much, and a global magnetic field for deflecting aside the solar wind and preventing the atmosphere being blown away into space. For these reasons, maybe planets like the Earth are something of a rarity, and so present particularly desirable targets for alien colonization.\n\nBut while it’s true that such worlds may well be required for complex life to evolve in the first place, once an intelligent species becomes technologically advanced enough to travel between the stars it’s also likely to be able to artificially manage a planet’s environment. For example, many people are already starting to talk seriously about “mega-engineering” or “geoengineering” projects to avoid the worst effects of global warming on Earth, and we’ve worked out, at least in broad terms so far, how further in the future we could “terraform” Mars to create a habitable environment for humans to live on the surface without needing spacesuits. Indeed, the very fact that Earth is already teeming with its own life (most of which is tenacious microbes that affect the chemistry of the atmosphere and oceans) may well be a hindrance to an alien species, with its own quirky biochemistry, looking for somewhere to colonize. It may well be easier to find a terrestrial world that hasn’t already developed life of its own, and install its own biosphere on an empty planet.\n\nAliens come to the Earth for the Earthlings\n\nTo my mind, then, the enormous amounts of time and energy that are likely to be necessary for traveling between the stars in a galaxy, and the fact that raw materials can be sought elsewhere more practically, would rule out aliens coming to the Earth simply to take something we have. I think we can safely rest assured that even if intelligent alien species do exist in our galaxy, they are not about to appear in our skies with an invasion fleet to subjugate humanity and begin stripping our world. Perhaps the thing that may attract only extraterrestrials to Earth is us. I suspect that if aliens did come to Earth, it would be as researchers: biologists, anthropologists, linguists, keen to understand the peculiar workings of life on Earth, to meet humanity and learn of our art, music, culture, languages, philosophies and religions.\n\nIf aliens do come to pay us a visit, there’s one final way that the movies have probably got it all wrong. The laws of physics (at least as we currently understand them—after all, in 100 years we may have worked out how to build a practical warp drive or stretch stable wormholes through the fabric of space-time) strongly constrain movement across the vast gulfs between stars. To make the journey time from one star system to the next anything less than scores of millennia, you need to accelerate your spaceship to a fair fraction of the speed of light. The greater the mass you need to accelerate, the greater the energy required, so you really want to keep your starships as small and light as possible.\n\nIntelligent life forms like humans are inherently bulky things, particularly when you want to send a team of them along with all the life support machinery and regeneration systems for keeping them alive in space. But a much more plausible alternative presents itself. Perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect ET to go through all the discomfort and bother of actually voyaging in person across the oceans of interstellar space to far-flung worlds, but instead to travel by proxy. To cross the galaxy not by encasing wet, vulnerable biological organisms withincomplex life-support technology, but asthe hardened, durable technology itself. With a more complete understanding of how the human brain works—the neuronal wiring diagram and other interactions that give rise to intelligence and consciousness—it stands to reason that we could not only simulate this perfectly within hardware to construct an AI (artificial intelligence), but also potentially upload the consciousness of a living person into a computer.\n\nContained within a capsule of miniaturized electronics and systems for self-repair you’d not only be essentially immortal, but also incredibly compact and light and much better suited for inter- stellar travel. In this sense, perhaps most life in the galaxy isn’t carbon-based (organic), but silicon-based. I don’t mean this in the sense of silicoid monsters imagined living inside volcanoes in The X-Filesor Star Trek, but as the hardware supporting complex sentient computer programs. Silicon life would be second generation, existing only because it has been designed and created by a precursor organic species, which itself evolved naturally on a habitable world.\n\nFor these reasons, it strikes me that if there is intelligent alien life out there in our galaxy, they almost certainly wouldn’t pay us a visit in person in huge city-sized motherships, but by sending their sentient robots as emissaries. But how would they know we’re here in the first place? Humanity has been leaking (or deliberately transmitting) radio waves out into space for roughly a century,\n\nSo an alien civilization running a SETI program with sensitive radio telescopes could detect us. But this radio bubble announcing our technological emergence, centered on the Earth and expanding out into space at light speed, is only around 200 light years across. That is a minuscule region of space in the galaxy as a whole, a disc 100,000 light years in diameter, and so even if the galaxy does contain other intelligent life forms, they would likely still be oblivious to our recent appearance. But although humanity has only been detectably civilized for a century, the Earth itself has been conspicuously alive for many hundreds of millions of years, and this links to one of the hottest topics in current astrobiology. Life on Earth, and specifically photosynthetic life such as plants and cyanobacteria that grow by absorbing the energy of sunlight and splitting water, has been releasing oxygen as a waste gas at such a high rate that it has built up in the atmosphere, first to just a few per cent, and today constituting a fifth of the Earth’s air. Oxygen is a very reactive gas, and the only reason it has been able to accumulate in the atmosphere is that it is constantly being replenished by living organisms. In fact, the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere is thought to be so unusual to the geochemistry of a planet that astrobiologists consider it to be a biosignature of life (specifically if oxygen and a reduced gas like methane are both present).\n\nWe are currently on the verge of building space-based telescopes that use spectroscopy to read the composition of the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets, and so survey the night sky for signs of life. And we’re only relative newcomers on the galactic scene. There’s nothing special about this exact moment in galactic history, and life on another planet could have evolved intelligence millions of years ago and used their own telescopes to look out for planets displaying the telltale sign of an oxygen-rich atmosphere. But apparently, as far as we can tell the fact that the Earth is obviously sporting biology has not prompted anyone to say hello.\n\nThis is a very curious observation, and to my mind could be down to two equally intriguing possibilities. The fact that Earth’s oxygen-rich atmosphere has apparently attracted no one’s attention may simply be because life is so rare that there is not a single other civilization in the galaxy with us to have their attention drawn. Or perhaps planets with an oxygen-rich atmosphere are so staggeringly common that the Earth just doesn’t stand out among the masses. In the first possibility we are solitary and lonely intelligent beings in the galaxy; in the second, life is absolutely rife in the cosmos. Both, to me, are equally profound realizations. And the most exciting aspect is that within your and my lifetime we will have launched our atmosphere-reading space telescopes and the science of astrobiology will have been able to tell which one is right.\n\nWhat a time to be an intelligent life form on Earth!\n\n__________________________________\n\nFrom Aliens: The World’s Leading Scientists on the Search for Extraterrestrial Life, ed.

A further £1.2bn of wages owed for hours worked are unpaid each year, according to a research group at Middlesex University business school in a report called Unpaid Britain.\n\nEmployers failing to pay basic wages are a widespread problem, but the weakness of enforcement means they can generally do so with impunity, the report says.\n\n“We’ve focused on the so-called gig economy and zero-hours contracts, but the much more pervasive practices of employers who simply pocket workers’ wages have continued largely unremarked,” Nick Clark, lead researcher, said.\n\nThe impact on the low–paid can be severe. Food bank data suggests 23,000 emergency food parcels are given out a year because workers have not been paid their wages, according to the report.\n\nResearchers used official statistics from sources including employment tribunals, the Insolvency Service, the Labour Force Survey, the ACAS conciliation service, and data from Citizens Advice to estimate the scale of deliberately unpaid work in the UK.\n\nThey also calculated an “index of employer delinquency” to identify the sectors where workers’ wages were most likely not to be paid in full. The worst five were: recreation and amusement activities; food and drink service; personal services such as hairdressing, nailbars, and dry cleaning; temporary agency working; and the hotel trade.\n\nThe Unpaid Britain group suggested that two types of cheating were prevalent. Where workers have variable hours and no payslips, employers are able to make a significant financial gain by cheating them a little and often, and it is hard for workers to keep track of hours worked or to prove what they are owed.\n\nA separate pattern involved bosses deferring pay on the grounds that their business was struggling and then repeatedly going into administration before workers had been paid. The researchers found many phoenix businesses being wound up with debts owed workers and HMRC but then reappearing with the same or related directors and premises under a different name.\n\nCitizens Advice experienced a doubling of cases of what it calls “wages theft” between 2014 and 2017, with about 9,000 workers asking for help in recovering deliberately unpaid wages, and 75,000 having problems with pay and entitlements in the last year.\n\nThe right to paid holiday in the UK – now 28 days a year for full time workers – was introduced as part of the European working time directive. For those with variable hours it is the equivalent of 12.07% of their average pay, but workers are often not made aware they are entitled to it or are only paid it if they challenge employers. There is no penalty on employers for failing to pay.\n\nThe report also highlights the barriers, such as tribunal and court fees, cuts in legal aid, and protection offered to employers by limited liability, that very often prevent workers recovering unpaid wages.\n\nThe number of individual workers taking employers to tribunal has fallen by 67% since the government introduced fees in 2013. Even when workers win at tribunal, they may still have to pay the costs of court enforcement orders and bailiffs where employers fail to pay up.\n\nWorkers at the fashionable Shoreditch branch of the celebrity restaurant Beach Blanket Babylon calculated that collectively they were owed thousands of pounds in unpaid wages in May.\n\nTheir payslips, which were made out in the name of Robert Newmark Restaurants, never seemed to match their own records of hours they had worked, they told the Guardian. They were supposed to be paid every 15 days, but the payslips would come at least 10 days late, and then the amount that actually went in to their bank accounts would be different again, making it hard to track.\n\nAntonio Amato worked as a chef in the kitchen at the east London restaurant and told us arrears of his wages reached £800. Staff, who are nearly all young migrant workers, said the shortfall followed a pattern.\n\nA group of them refused to work until they had been paid what they were owed. “They told us we don’t have any money, we can’t pay you. And now you have to leave,” Mido Rafet, a waiter who said he was owed hundreds of pounds, told us.\n\nThe shortfall in Amato’s wages meant he had to leave his accommodation because he could not keep up with his rental payments; others described similar crises over bills. The workers began protesting outside the restaurant and on social media, at which point the management agreed to negotiate, they said. Some were paid what they were due, but several were not.\n\nThe restaurant owners had been accused of the same behaviour before. In January another worker took Robert Newmark Restaurants to an employment tribunal with a very similar story. The judge found he was owed £2,000. The company did not attend the hearing.\n\nRobert Newmark was interviewed 15 months ago by a property magazine at home in a lavish19th-century gothic mansion in Hampstead, north London, that he co-owns with his son Rex and other partners.\n\nTogether with another son, Brett, he controlled the Beach Blanket Babylon restaurants in Notting Hill’s Ledbury Road and Shoreditch’s Bethnal Green Road through a company called Rosslyn Hill Ltd when it went bust in 2014 owing HMRC more than £1m in unpaid PAYE, national insurance and VAT.\n\nRobert Newmark had received payments of at least £267,000 from the company in its last six months, according to the government’s insolvency service. He had already been disqualified from acting as a director after the failure of a previous company trading as Beach Blanket Babylon, Frontmirror Ltd.\n\nDirectors of that company had taken substantial loans, and HMRC estimated it owed about £1m in taxes. In August 2016 Newmark was once again disqualified from acting as director or managing a limited company, this time along with his son Brett, for a combined eight and a half years. It is not illegal for disqualified people to continue to operate as sole traders.\n\nA spokesperson for Beach Blanket Babylon said in a statement that there had been a delay in paying some wages because of cash flow problems caused by “unforeseeable trading events”. Protests by staff had exacerbated the problem by hitting trade, it added. “We would like to apologise to any staff who have suffered payment arrears and reaffirm out commitment to ensure everyone is paid in full.”\n\nStaff told us some payments were made after the Guardian’s inquiries. Rafet said he had been paid most of the disputed money after our contact with the company, while Amato also received some but was still in dispute over holiday pay."],[8,"Child poverty in the US is a disgrace. Experts are embracing this simple plan to cut it.","Most rich countries besides the US have hit on a surprisingly simple approach to reducing child poverty: just giving parents money.\n\nThis idea, known as a child benefit or child allowance, exists in almost every EU country as well as in Canada and Australia. In many countries, the payments are truly universal; you get the money no matter how much you earn. In others, like Canada, the payments phase out for top earners but almost everyone else benefits. France has a weird scheme where only families with two or more children get benefits, as an incentive to have more kids.\n\nBut the core principle is the same in every system: Low and middle-income families are entitled to substantial cash benefits to help them raise their children.\n\nThis helps explain why European countries are so much better at fighting child poverty than the US is. While about 11.8 percent of US children live in absolute poverty (as indicated by the US poverty line), only 6.2 percent of German children do, and only 3.6 percent of Swedish children. The numbers get even worse when you define poverty like most European countries do, as living under half the median income. By that standard, 20 percent of children in the US live in poverty, compared to only about 10.3 percent in Germany or 4.9 percent in the Netherlands. This isn’t exclusively due to child benefits, but they play a crucial role.\n\nThe US has only a patchwork system of subsidies for parents, and the major benefit, the Child Tax Credit, is limited in ways that make it unhelpful to the Americans who need cash assistance the most. During the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton proposed doubling the credit for young children and making it more generous to low earners. And some Republicans, including Sens. Mike Lee and Marco Rubio, have warmed to the idea of expanding the child tax credit, while still requiring parents to work for it.\n\nA growing number of child poverty experts and think tankers in the US, though, are arguing that wouldn’t be enough. They, along with House Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, are embracing a more dramatic policy change: a fully refundable child benefit, which families could receive whether or not they’re earning money. Even in the limited form for young children that House Democrats are proposing, the policy could substantially cut child poverty and help wipe out extreme forms of poverty where families subsist without any cash income. It would certainly do vastly more than the weak child care proposals Ivanka Trump has put forward.\n\nChild poverty is both a tragedy and a huge drain on societal resources. One economic analysis of costs — increased crime, decreased earnings later in life, and poorer health — found that child poverty costs the US nearly 4 percent of GDP every year, or over $700 billion in 2016 alone.\n\nSo the best rationale for universal child benefits is that they substantially reduce child poverty.\n\nIn 1999, Tony Blair and the Labour Party introduced a universal benefit in the UK. The measure was part of a broader set of proposals meant to tackle child poverty, including tax credits, means-tested programs, a national minimum wage, a workers' tax credit, universal pre-K, expanded child care, and much longer parental leave.\n\nThe result was that absolute poverty fell by more than half from 1999 to 2009, while relative poverty (the share of children under 60 percent of the median income) fell by 15 percent. The decrease in relative poverty was smaller because while things got dramatically better for the poor, the middle class gained too.\n\nWhile child poverty in the US declined slightly over the same period, a comparison of the two trend lines is still startling:\n\nThe benefit and tax credit increases from 1997 to 2005 caused incomes for the bottom 10 percent of households to grow 20 percent, according to researchers Tom Sefton, John Hills, and Holly Sutherland.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s team says his plan to dramatically increase benefits — to $4,000 for children over 6, more for younger children and children with disabilities — will cut child poverty in Canada by 40 percent.\n\nWhile concerns over “welfare queens” living high on the hog and misspending benefits have often stopped the US from expanding safety net programs, there’s no evidence that child benefits would be used this way. The benefits aren't misspent, either. Sam Houston State University's Christian Raschke has found that Kindergeld, the delightfully named German child benefit program, leads families to spend more on food but not to drink more alcohol. One study of the earned income tax credit, a government benefit for working low-income families, found that receiving cash actually makes mothers more likely to get prenatal care, which in turn reduces the amount they smoke and drink.\n\nThat’s not the only benefit. A growing body of evidence suggests that investments in early childhood development can pay off in lower crime, higher earnings, and greater educational attainment later on.\n\nPrograms that give families cash, UC Irvine economist Greg Duncan has found, result in better learning outcomes and higher earnings for their kids. One study found a $3,000 annual income increase for poor parents is associated with 19 percent higher earnings for their child once he or she grows up. That implies that a child allowance of that size could dramatically improve the lives of children decades later.\n\nThere’s plenty of other research where that came from:\n\nCash subsidies can even extend lives. Brown's Anna Aizer, University of Toronto's Shari Eli, Northwestern's Joseph Ferrie, and UCLA's Adriana Lleras-Muney looked at the Mothers' Pension program, the first federal welfare program in American history, which ran from 1911 to 1935. They found that male children of mothers who were accepted for the program lived one year longer, got more schooling, and had incomes 14 percent greater than children of mothers who were rejected.\n\nA child benefit would even have some effects that social conservatives might like. It encourages having more kids, and would likely reduce abortion rates by making it less costly to raise children. Money troubles are also a leading cause of marital strife, family instability, and divorce. Wellesley College sociologist Josh McCabe has argued for a universal child benefit in pieces for National Review on exactly these grounds.\n\nThe Child Tax Credit, the main existing benefit for families in the US, falls short in several ways. Until the Bush tax cuts of 2001, it was non-refundable, meaning that the 44 percent of families who don’t earn enough to pay federal income taxes didn’t benefit at all. Today, it’s partially refundable, but only for families earning at least $3,000; full benefits don’t kick in until you’re making $9,667 a year.\n\nThis is particularly worrying given the rising number of extremely poor Americans who report having literally no cash income. Recent estimates suggest that nearly 1.2 million children were in families making under $2 a day per person in cash income in 2012, up from only 415,000 children in 1995. Giving out a child allowance could eliminate this kind of extreme child poverty at relatively little cost.\n\nThe easiest way to set up a child allowance would be to simply offer a fully refundable tax credit that doesn’t phase in with earnings at all. The Child Tax Credit Improvement Act from Congress member Rosa DeLauro, legislation backed by Nancy Pelosi and John Lewis, would create a new $3,600 fully refundable tax credit for kids under 6 and speed up the phase-in on the existing credit so it would be more generous to the poorest families. That’s not quite a child allowance for all kids under 18, but it’s a huge step in the right direction.\n\nThink tanks and academics have, in the past few years, produced a bevy of plans that would offer families with children of any age a child benefit, not pegged to income. Rachel West, Melissa Boteach, and Rebecca Vallas at the Center for American Progress have a plan the makes the child tax credit fully refundable, eliminating the earnings requirement entirely, indexes the credit for inflation, and gives families with children under 3 a monthly Young Child Tax Credit benefit of $125 per month ($1,500 a year).\n\nThey estimated that the proposal, which influenced DeLauro’s bill, would cost under $30 billion a year (about what we spend on Pell Grants and less than half the cost of food stamps) and nearly double the credit's anti-poverty impact:\n\nA forthcoming proposal from a murderer’s row of poverty experts — including $2 a Day co-authors Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer, Columbia’s Jane Waldfogel, Christopher Wimer and Irwin Garfinkel, Wisconsin’s Timothy Smeeding, UC Irvine’s Greg Duncan, NYU’s Hiro Yoshikawa, and the Children’s Research and Education Institute's David Harris — similarly envisions a child allowance as an anti-poverty measure. The authors propose three different models a child allowance could take:\n\nBut cutting poverty isn’t the only attraction of a child benefit. It’s also a worthwhile just as a tool for consolidating the dizzying array of current programs offered to parents. Samuel Hammond and Robert Orr at the libertarian Niskanen Center have proposed an annual child benefit of $2,000 per year, paid out monthly to households, and financed by eliminating several existing programs: the income tax's dependent exemption, the dependent care credit (which isn't refundable and does nothing for the poor), food stamp benefits for children, and five different school meal programs like free school lunches and breakfasts.\n\nThose programs add up to $98 billion a year, almost exactly the cost of making the child tax credit fully refundable and doubling it to $2,000.\n\nIt’s not clear, though, how much this would end up helping low-income families. Annual food stamp benefits can total near $2,000 per child in a household, and when you add free school meals on top of that, it’s unclear how many families this would leave better off. Cash aid is better than a food voucher (you can’t pay rent with food stamps), but if the goal is to increase the amount of money going to poor families, cutting food stamps and school meals aren’t great options. Update: Hammond has a compelling argument that this actually would meaningfully raise benefits for the poorest Americans; see this Twitter thread.\n\nA child benefit could also be part of a broader effort to reform the tax code, consolidate provisions, and avoid distortions that have been introduced over the years. The Tax Policy Center’s Jim Nunns, Elaine Maag, and Hang Nguyen have included a child benefit in a broader plan to rethink how the tax code treats work and children.\n\nCurrently, the Earned Income Tax Credit is both the primary work subsidy in the tax code and a form of child subsidy for workers with children; it offers little in the way of support for childless workers (a problem both President Barack Obama and Paul Ryan released proposals to address), but benefits ramp up substantially as households add more children. Meanwhile, the child and dependent care credit is nonrefundable and does basically nothing to help poor families afford child care services, and the dependent exemption is likewise only a benefit to families rich enough to pay income taxes.\n\nNunns, Maag, and Nguyen propose a new system to replace this. Everyone who works would get a Worker Credit (maxing out at $1,530) that doesn't vary with household size, to wipe out payroll taxes on poverty-level earnings. For every child, they’d get first a fully refundable credit of $2,013, and then, to replace the Earned Income Tax Credit’s benefits for children, a credit of up to $2,400 per kid that phases in with income.\n\nThe plan would result in a big tax cut for most Americans: the average low-income family with children would get $2,870 back. The plan is somewhat pricey (about $1 trillion over 10 years) but still much cheaper than the tax breaks that Paul Ryan and Donald Trump have proposed.\n\nGetting any of these plans past a Republican Congress and president would be tough. Some Republicans like Sens. Mike Lee and Marco Rubio have warmed to the idea of expanding the child tax credit; Lee and Rubio want to add a new one to the tune of $2,500. But they don’t want it to be fully refundable. They only want it refundable against income and payroll taxes, as a way to avoid directing benefits to people out of the workforce.\n\nSince payroll taxes start with the first dollar, that would be roughly equivalent to keeping the existing 15 percent phase-in rate but starting at $0 rather than $3,000. That’s an improvement for poor families, no doubt, as is the increased total amount of the credit, but it’s not nearly as good as a true child allowance. And even Lee and Rubio’s plan is hugely controversial among Republicans. It’s not part of either Trump or Paul Ryan’s tax proposals, and it’s probably not going to be a part of any tax legislation this year.\n\nThere’s nothing, however, stopping states like California or New York from imposing their own child allowances, maybe starting at a modest level like $1,000 and then ramping up. This is easily within the budgetary ability of a large state, if coupled with modest income tax increases for high earners, or maybe a hike in the alcohol and cigarette taxes. Given the emerging consensus among child poverty experts that parents need cash, states would be smart to make the first move here."],[8,"How Labour Friends of Israel tried to undermine Jeremy Corbyn","Thursday’s general election was an earthquake for the UK’s political establishment.\n\nAnd although the issue did not feature in the campaign, the result has significant implications for the Palestinian cause.\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has been a lifelong supporter of the Palestinian struggle for justice.\n\nIn an August 2015 interview with The Electronic Intifada, he called for an arms embargo on Israel and supported other key elements of BDS, the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement for Palestinian rights.\n\nHis party’s 2017 manifesto pledged that a Labour government would “immediately recognize the state of Palestine” – a position the governing Conservatives oppose.\n\nDue to his positions on Palestine, throughout 2016 Corbyn faced a relentless, manufactured campaign charging that under his leadership the Labour Party was rife with anti-Semitism.\n\nA witch hunt by the party machine led to dozens of members being suspended on baseless or grossly exaggerated accusations pushed by a hostile media establishment, right-wing Labour lawmakers and Israel lobby groups.\n\nIn some cases, accusations of left-wing anti-Semitism were entirely fabricated.\n\nEven the head of Labour Friends of Israel, lawmaker Joan Ryan, was caught by an underdercover Al Jazeera investigation broadcast in January fabricating allegations of anti-Semitism against a party member who questioned Israel’s settlements in the occupied West Bank.\n\nA lobby group within the party, Labour Friends of Israel coordinates its activities with the Israeli embassy, which has provided funding to secretive efforts to win lawmakers over to Israel’s cause.\n\nLast week Ryan was re-elected as Labour member of Parliament for Enfield North. Like many in her party she rode Corbyn’s coat tails to an increased majority – despite her own efforts to sabotage the Labour leader and other supporters of Palestinian rights.\n\nIn a letter sent to her own constituents, obtained by The Electronic Intifada, Ryan talked down Corbyn’s chances of winning, claiming that “many” local people “tell me they have more confidence in Theresa May as prime minister than they would have in Jeremy Corbyn.”\n\nDespite “your misgivings about the Labour leadership,” Ryan wrote, “I hope that you will consider voting for me as your local MP.” She promised if re-elected “to work for a Labour Party that once again can deserve your confidence” – a not so subtle suggestion that it did not deserve their confidence in this election.\n\nHer letter echoed the complaints of several right-wing Labour candidates who told media – usually anonymously – that they would be fighting “local” campaigns to distance themselves from Corbyn and the Labour manifesto.\n\nAnother key figure in the efforts to smear Corbyn and the Labour Party is veteran Israel lobbyist Jeremy Newmark, Labour’s candidate for a North London seat.\n\nThe Jewish Chronicle reported that Newmark ran a similar anti-Corbyn campaign in the Finchley and Golders Green constituency where he contested the election.\n\nThe paper reported Newmark saying “that voters should support him in the knowledge that Jeremy Corbyn will not become prime minister.”\n\nNewmark told the paper that he had “regularly challenged the leader face to face and he has heard my view directly that he has failed to demonstrate sufficient understanding of the nature of modern anti-Semitism.”\n\nNewmark became chair of a revived Jewish Labour Movement in February 2016. Soon after, the JLM was at the center of efforts to hype up the anti-Semitism crisis.\n\nNewmark has a well-documented record of making false accusations of anti-Jewish bigotry as part of his efforts to silence and discredit the Palestine solidarity movement.\n\nA longtime Israel lobbyist, Newmark was revealed by Al Jazeera’s undercover investigation in January to still be working closely with the Israeli embassy during the 2016 Labour Party conference.\n\nHe was filmed at a closed-door meeting joking and discussing strategy with disgraced embassy agent Shai Masot and Ambassador Mark Regev.\n\nIsrael quickly called Masot back to Tel Aviv after the Al Jazeera investigation made headlines. Masot had been caught on video plotting with a civil servant to “take down” a senior British government minister perceived as critical of Israel.\n\nDespite his record of dishonesty, Newmark was selected as a Labour candidate. He then used his media platform in an effort to revive the discredited anti-Semitism smears.\n\nEven as Corbyn’s poll numbers were surging, Newmark claimed to the BBC that “Jeremy Corbyn appears to have failed to understand the nature of contemporary anti-Semitism.”\n\nOn election day, Newmark failed to take the seat from Conservative incumbent Mike Freer – who is also staunchly pro-Israel.\n\nAnother key Jewish Labour Movement figure is vice chair Mike Katz, who unsuccessfully contested the neighboring North London seat of Hendon.\n\nIn a debate on the J-TV YouTube channel, Katz’s Conservative opponent Matthew Offord accused Katz of being “put up” to fight the seat by the Labour establishment, in an area with a significant Jewish population.\n\n“The local party did not chose you. You were imposed,” Offord claimed. Katz denied being imposed by the party machine, though he acknowledged that he was not chosen by the “traditional process.”\n\nThe Conservative lawmaker may have had a point.\n\nThe Skwawkbox, a well-informed pro-Corbyn website, reported evidence that Labour Party headquarters had funnelled campaign resources away from seats being contested by pro-Corbyn candidates and towards so-called “moderates.”\n\nThe Electronic Intifada understands that there was a power struggle between the party establishment in Labour headquarters and Corbyn’s office over the list of candidates, with the latter being outmaneuvered in many cases.\n\nAfter the election, Katz claimed that the anti-Semitism allegedly rife in the Corbyn-led Labour Party had been a factor in his defeat.\n\nNewmark and Katz took a break from campaigning last month to participate in an Israeli embassy reception celebrating Israel’s “independence” – the 1948 ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinians from their homeland – as well as the 50th anniversary of Israel’s military occupation of East Jerusalem.\n\nThe irony for people like Joan Ryan, and her fellow Labour “friend of Israel” Wes Streeting – another vocal stoker of the anti-Semitism allegations last year – is that the massive swings to Labour achieved by the Corbyn-led party often saved them in their seats.\n\nThe surge in turnout for Labour even helped Streeting substantially increase his razor-thin majority.\n\nDuring the campaign, Streeting also bad-mouthed his party, reviving the anti-Semitism allegations and telling voters he would “fight relentlessly to get Labour back to being an effective opposition and alternative party of government that’s actually worth their support.”\n\nClayton Swisher, head of Al Jazeera’s investigative unit, commented on Twitter that the UK election result was a loss for Israel’s “covert influence campaign” in the UK.\n\nA key element in that campaign was the effort to attract Labour-leaning youth to Israel’s cause. It has clearly made no headway.\n\nCorbyn, the lifelong Palestine and anti-war campaigner, enthused and mobilized young people to vote Labour with a manifesto of ending austerity, providing free university tuition and redressing growing inequality.\n\nSwisher predicts that the result will lead to a crisis at Israel’s strategic affairs ministry – the government department which spends tens of millions of dollars to fight BDS and to market Israel to progressive Western audiences.\n\nCorbyn’s position as Labour leader now looks unassailable.\n\nThough short of the seats he needs to become prime minister, Corbyn pulled off stunning gains when the consensus outside the grassroots movement that supported him was that Labour would suffer an historic defeat.\n\nLabour saw its share of the vote surge to 40 percent, just behind May’s Conservatives who in a stunning upset lost their parliamentary majority.\n\nOne of his most bitter critics, the staunchly pro-Israel pundit Stephen Pollard, noted that, in terms of the increase in vote share, the Labour leader had outperformed every one of his predecessors since Clement Attlee’s landslide win against Winston Churchill in 1945.\n\nThat Labour government created the National Health Service and the postwar welfare state that brought millions of people out of sickness and poverty.\n\nWithout a majority, May has done a deal with Northern Ireland’s hard-right Democratic Unionist Party, which has a history of sectarian bigotry and ties to violent extremist groups. The Christian Zionist DUP’s 10 seats will allow May to cling to office in exchange for as yet unspecified concessions.\n\nEven May’s predecessor, former Conservative prime minister John Major, has warned that her deal with the DUP could endanger the peace process in Ireland.\n\nMay sold her leadership as “strong and stable” and warned voters not to elect a “coalition of chaos” led by Labour.\n\nBut it is her weak minority government, reliant on partners even senior figures in her own party can’t stomach, that looks unlikely to endure. Another election may come soon.\n\nA key message from this one that is energizing people in the UK and around the world is that left-wing policies, encompassing strong support for Palestinian rights, form a realistic and winning program."],[8,"Michelle Obama announces she will not be running for President","After Donald Trump’s seismic victory, talk of whether Michelle Obama would run for president dominated discussions. Bolstered by consistently high popularity ratings and applauded for her barnstorming speech against the now-President-elect, the First Lady became one of the most popular figures of the 2016 election.\n\nBut Ms Obama has now made it clear she will not be running for office. In an extensive interview with Oprah Winfrey, she said she would not put her family through more time in the spotlight.\n\nReferring to the rumours, she said: “I think some people think it's serious, but some people are just hopeful.”\n\n“I don't make stuff up, I'm not coy. I'm pretty direct. If I was interested in it, I would say. I don't believe in playing games.”\n\nMs Obama said eight years in the White House had been long enough and she did not want to force her children to be faced with more sacrifices. \n\n“This is hard, it's a hard job … When you run, your kids lives stop”.\n\n“The next family that comes in here, every person in that family - every child, every grandchild - their lives will be turned upside down in a way that no American really understands,” she said.\n\n“And it's not for us to complain about it, so you don't hear complaints, but it is a truth, an actuality, that there is a weight to it”.\n\nBarack Obama has previously denied that his wife would run for office, saying she did not “have the patience or the inclination to actually be a candidate herself”.\n\nIn the one-hour interview which was broadcast on Monday night on CBS, Ms Obama also expressed her surprise at being referred to as an “angry black women” during her husband’s 2007 presidential campaign.\n\n“That was one of those things where you think, ‘Dang, you don’t even know me,’” she said. “You just sort of feel like, ‘Wow, where did that come from?’”\n\n“You think, that is so not me! But then you sort of think, well, this isn't about me,” she went on. “This is about the person or the people who write it.”\n\n\"We are so afraid of each other, you know?\" she said. \"Color, wealth, these things that don't matter still play too much of a role in how we see one another. And it's sad, because the thing that least defines us as people is the color of our skin, the size of our bank account. None of that matters.\"\n\nMs Obama said she was concerned about the future of America and prayed Americans still have “hope”.\n\nWhen she was probed about whether her husband’s government achieved “hope”, she said she did but also noted the sharp distinctions between him and his successor President-elect Trump.\n\n“Yes, I do. Because we feel the difference now. See, now we are feeling what not having hope feels like, you know. Hope is necessary. It is a necessary concept. What do you give your kids if you can't give them hope?”\n\nMs Obama also referred to her meeting with the soon-to-be First Lady Melania Trump, saying that while she did not give her any specific advice, she told her that “the door is always open” and “you really don't know what you don't know until you're here”.\n\nHer husband also made a surprise visit to the interview. When asked about what has surprised him the most about his wife as First Lady, he applauded her expertise for the job. “The way in which she blended purpose and policy with fun so that she was able to reach beyond Washington on her health care initiatives, on her military family work was masterful.”"],[8,"Stop Pretending The 'Anti-Sharia' Movement Has Anything To Do With Empowering Women","ACT for America, a national grassroots anti-Muslim organization designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an extremist group, claims its “March Against Sharia” events are an effort to protect Muslim women and children from Islamic law. The group asserts that scattered incidents of honor killings and female genital mutilationin the U.S. are evidence that Sharia, a system of Islamic jurisprudence, is slowly creeping into American society.\n\n“We want to feel safe,” she added. “We want to be able to walk down the street and not feel like our lives are at risk because we choose to practice our faith, a fundamental human right. We also want hate groups to stop using us as an excuse for their bigotry.”\n\n“The left will try to make this about hate, saying this is anti-Muslim,” Scott Presler, one of the organizers of Saturday’s event, told right-wing news site WorldNetDaily. “No, who is affected by FGM more than Muslim women? We are working for human rights and to protect Muslim women everywhere.”\n\n“We are still reeling from the news of two Muslim children being harassed on public transportation when three non-Muslim allies intervened to their defense and had their throats slashed,” she said. “For ACT for America to claim that they have Muslim women’s best interest at heart is not even ironically humorous, it’s just perverse.”\n\n“Who gets to determine what Muslim women’s best interests are ― actual Muslim women, or known proponents of rhetoric and policies which do considerable harm to the lives of Muslim women in the U.S. and around the globe?” she said.\n\n“I don’t need anyone to speak for me ― especially persons who do not have a fundamental respect for my humanity and my autonomy ― and neither does any other Muslim woman,” Auston said. “We speak for ourselves.”\n\nAli noted that practices like FGM and honor killings, though present in some Muslim-majority countries, are rooted more so in culture than in religion. “Muslims that practice these horrific things may say that they are doing them because of religion. But when you reference the Quran, Hadith, and Shariah law, there is nothing to back up their claims,” Ali said. “These practices do not, in any way, reflect what Islam or Islamic law teaches.”\n\n“There is no shortage of Muslim American women who do not need anti-Muslim zealots claiming to save us from a religion that has empowered us all to be who we are today,” said Linda Sarsour, an activist and one of the organizers of the historic Women’s March on Washington.\n\nFrom “politicians like Ilhan Omar to academics like Dalia Mogahed to mental health providers like Kameelah Rashad to those working on women inclusion and integration in mosques like Sister Aisha Aladawiya and Hind Makki to vocal activists and survivors of FGM like Maryam Saifee to anti-racism trainers like Margari Hill to civil rights attorneys like Zahra Billoo,” Sarsour said, there are endless examples of Muslim women promoting their own empowerment without the help of ACT for America."],[8,"Refugee rescue ships not acting as ‘pull factor’ or ‘colluding with people smugglers’, report finds","Humanitarian ships rescuing refugeesin the Mediterranean Sea are not acting as a “pull factor” driving increasing refugee boat crossings or “colluding” with smugglers, research has found.\n\nA report by the Forensic Oceanography department at Goldsmiths, University of London, rejected a “toxic narrative” seeking to blame NGOs for the worsening crisis.\n\nExperts dismantled allegations made by agencies such as Frontex and leading European politicians, who claimed charities were encouraging smugglers to use more dangerous tactics on the treacherous passage between Libya and Italy.\n\nThe Blaming the Rescuers report’s author, Lorenzo Pezzani, said: “The evidence simply does not support the idea that rescues by NGOs are to blame for an increase in migrants crossing. \n\n“The argument against NGOs deliberately ignores the worsening economic and political crisis across several regions in Africa that has driven up the numbers of crossings in 2016.\n\n“The violence against migrants in Libya is so extreme that they attempt the sea crossing with or without search and rescue being available.”\n\nThe United Nations has documented “slave auctions” where African migrants are openly bought and sold in the war-torn country, as well as endemic rates of rape, abuse, torture and forced labour.\n\nDespite the dire situation, the EU has been giving funding, training and equipment to theLibyan coastguard in efforts to turn back migrant boats and prevent the crossings.\n\nHumanitarian groups, which have documented the coastguardabusing migrantsand attacking their ships, say forcing refugees from international waters back into Libya is a violation of international law.\n\nIncreasing co-operation with Libya’s fragile Government of National Accord has coincided with record crossings and deaths in the Central Mediterranean, where almost 1,800 refugees have lost their lives so far this year.\n\nResearchers found no evidence that the rocketing figures – 181,500 migrants were rescued and taken to Italy in 2016 – were caused by humanitarian search-and-rescue missions.\n\n “As Frontex recognised, the increase was consistent with previous year-on-year trends of increasing crossings by African migrants, which cannot be attributed to the presence of search-and-rescue NGOs… who stepped in after the EU and its member states pulled out in late 2014,” the report said.\n\nAs evidence, it pointed to increased migrant boats on routes that were not patrolled by rescue ships, including a 46 per cent spike in crossings from Morocco. \n\nThe report also examined accusations that rescue groups are “helping criminals”, finding no evidence of the allegations after reviewing official documents, statistics, qualitative interviews, photographs and maps.\n\nRight-wing groups have seized on unsubstantiated claims made by a prosecutor in Sicily that NGOs were “colluding” with criminal gangsand allegedly making phone calls to Libya.\n\nThe Italian parliament has also launched a fact-finding mission into the issue, which is hearing evidence from law-enforcement agencies and aid workers.\n\nThe accusations having resulted in efforts by the French far-right group Génération Identitaire to raise thousands of pounds for their own ship to intercept refugee rescues and stop a supposed “invasion by enemies and criminals”.\n\nA trial run off the coast of Sicily last month disrupted a rescue ship until Italian authorities, who deploy rescue ships on their operations, intervened and drove the anti-immigration activists off.\n\nCampaigner Caroline Criado-Perez set up a crowdfunding counter-campaign that has so far raised more than £70,000 for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which runs two rescue ships.\n\nResearchers also dismissed claims that NGOs were causing smugglers to switch from wooden vessels to flimsy rubber dinghies that are incapable of reaching Europe.\n\nThey found that tactics used by gangs profiting from the lucrative human trade have worsened steadily since the outbreak of Libya’s civil war, when the UK was among the countries backing the removal of dictator Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nBarack Obama described the ensuing chaos as a “sh*t show”, seeing rival governments and countless armed groups including Isis rush into the power vacuum, where they are still battling for control.\n\nThe Goldsmiths report also placed partial blame on the EU’s Operation Sophia mission, which had a “major impact on smugglers’ tactics” by intercepting and destroying larger and safer wooden boats. \n\n“The Libyan coastguard’s use of violence when intercepting vessels also affected smugglers’ tactics and at times led to boats capsizing, endangering everyone on board,” it added.\n\nIt concluded that those blaming NGOs are choosing to ignore the role other actors, including EU agencies and national governments, have played in making migrant crossings more dangerous.\n\n“We believe that the toxic narrative falsely claiming that NGO search and rescue is to blame for the migrant crossing situation is part of a worrying tendency to criminalise solidarity initiatives towards migrants,” Mr Pezzani said. \n\n“It is also a convenient distraction, as it diverts attention from the failures of the states involved to deal with the real issues. \n\n“One has to ask: why is there such a gap in search-and-rescue activities in the first place that makes NGO rescues so essential?”\n\nCharles Heller, another researcher from Goldsmiths, said if mounting pressure and far-right campaigns stopped humanitarian operations in the Mediterranean Sea, “many more” refugees would die on the crossing.  \n\n“That is precisely what happened when attacks led to the ending of the Italian Mare Nostrum operation in 2014,” he added.\n\nCharities have previouslyrejected claims of collusion with smugglers as “baseless”,while calling for the EU to provide safe and legal routes for refugees to reach safety.\n\nStefano Argenziano, MSF’s operations manager for migration, said: “The real problem is that people are dying. There’s a gap in assistance and we’re starting to wonder whether this is part of a deliberate plan to step the migration flow… a deadly deterrent.”\n\nA recent Oxford University study also found rescues have “little or no effect on the number of arrivals”, while research by the Unravelling the Mediterranean Migration Crisis project found European policy on the refuge crisis had been an “absolute failure”.\n\nSophie Beau, the co-founder of rescue charity SOS Mediterranee, said NGOs were being forced to act by the “failure of European states”, who should be increasing capacity themselves.\n\n“NGOs are being blamed for our presence, when authorities should be blamed for their absence,” she added.\n\n“There’s a humanitarian tragedy unfolding in front of our eyes at the door of Europe and we cannot just remain blind.”\n\nMore than 61,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year and 7,600 in Greece, mostly from Nigeria, Bangladesh, Syria and sub-Saharan African nations."],[8,"Yemen hunger crisis leaves refugee chief 'shocked to the bones'","One of Europe’s most experienced diplomats has said he was “shocked to the bones” by the hunger he saw in Yemen.\n\nJan Egeland, the current head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, condemned “this gigantic failure of international diplomacy” and said that only 3 million people out of the 7 million people who were starving had been fed last month.\n\n“Men with guns and power inside Yemen as well as in regional and international capitals are undermining every effort to avert an entirely preventable famine,” he said, “as well as the collapse of health and education services for millions of children.”\n\nIn April, the World Food Programme could only afford to feed 3 million men, women and children in Yemen – a country said to be on the brink of famine – due to a lack of resources and the late arrival of food shipments, the organisation said.\n\nThe secretary general of the NRC is on a five-day visit to the country. “I am shocked to my bones by what I have seen and heard here in war- and hunger-stricken Yemen. The world is letting some 7 million men, women and children slowly but surely be engulfed by unprecedented famine. It is not a drought that is at fault. This preventable catastrophe is man-made from A to Z.”\n\nAn estimated 19 million people in a country with a total population of roughly 27 million are in need of some form of aid, according to the UN. The price of basic commodities has risen by a third.\n\nEgeland said he met teachers, health workers and engineers who had not been paid for eight months and were struggling to survive.\n\nHe said: “An aid worker told me the fear and desperation among civilians is now so great that mothers with acutely undernourished children grab their kids from hospital beds when they hear the war planes flying over.”\n\nThe food crisis in Yemen has been made worse by the continuing conflict between the Houthi rebels who control Sana’a together with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh – who led the country from 1990 to 2012 – and forces loyal to the ousted president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia has led US-backed military intervention in Yemen aimed at reinstating Hadi, who lives in exile in Riyadh, and countering the advances of the Iran-backed Houthi forces.\n\nEgeland appealed to the parties of the conflict to agree a ceasefire and to keep the the main humanitarian supply route, the port of Hodeida, open. There have been warnings of an attack on the port by the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nHe said: “Nowhere on Earth are as many lives at risk. We are not even sure that the main humanitarian lifeline through the port of Hodeida will be kept open.”\n\nActivists on the ground have warned that relief is being prevented from reaching its recipients.\n\nAntónio Guterres, the UN secretary general, has warned that Yemen is facing a “tragedy of immense proportions”, with a child under five dying of preventable causes every 10 minutes on average.\n\nAt a pledging conference in Geneva last week, governments and international donors promised the UN $1.1bn (£850m), half of what the organisation says is needed to prevent famine in Yemen.\n\nHowever, UN officials said the pledges need to be urgently committed to cash if they are to continue feeding the 7 million people said to be on the brink of famine.\n\nGeorge Khoury, head of the UN’s Yemen Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said that pledges take time to transfer into cash in the bank accounts of agencies.\n\n“It’s only been a few days,” Khoury said. “It takes time. The majority of the money is still in pledges.\n\n“The problem from our side is that we need the money now. Not in August or September. If the World Food Programme does not get the money now, there will be a break in the food pipeline by the beginning of July. Every month we are expected to feed 7 million people. Last month, the WFP reached 3 million, because of lack of resources.”\n\nDelayed food shipments into Yemen, a country that relies on imports, was another significant factor affecting the number of people WFP could reach, the agency said.\n\nIn May, WFP hopes to reach 6 million people who are severely food insecure, but the organisation will have to cut rations for 4 million of them by 60% in order to do so."],[8,"Commentary: Merkel is wrong about Trump and Brexit","The chancellor of Germany no longer trusts the United States or the United Kingdom. In a May 28 campaign speech in Bavaria, Angela Merkel signaled distance from the two “Anglo Saxon” states, telling her audience “we Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands.”\n\nGerman commentators were quick to point out that the radicalism of the address has been over-emphasized:  “Europe has a vital interest in keeping the U.S. engaged,” wrote Europe expert Ulrich Speck in the Financial Times. “[Merkel] has no ambition to replace the current transatlantic arrangement with something else.”  \n\nMerkel did in fact qualify her remarks, saying she couldn't “fully rely,” on the United States and the U.K., and the times in which she could were “somewhatover.” The chancellor faces a general election in September, and though her conservative Christian Democrats not only won an upset victory in a significant May state election but is also several points ahead of the center-left Social Democrats in the national polls, she cannot take victory for granted. \n\nShe won’t ditch NATO, nor is she about to, but she can’t look as if she likes Donald Trump, a man who has tweeted out his criticism of Germany for paying “FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military.”   \n\nMerkel, if untypically incautious, is right to signal that Trump is a threat to the Western alliance, but wrong to do it in words which could worsen a developing rift. She was also quite wrong to put Britain’s Brexit decision in the same basket. Buoyed by her party’s favorable polls and the prospect of a reinvigorated Franco-German motor at the heart of the Union following centrist Emmanuel Macron’s victory in the French presidential race, she must see Britain’s decision – which weakens the EU – as near treachery. But U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s response to Merkel – “we’re leaving the EU but we’re not leaving Europe” – seemed heartfelt. \n\nAll over Europe, politicians and commentators are rolling up Brexit and Trump into one ball of populist horror, and (figuratively, of course) spitting on it. A popular stereotype of the British as arrogant plays into the present general disapproval.\n\nBut Brexit is not Trumpism. Leaving the EU is likely an economic mistake, perhaps of large proportions, but it is not an undemocratic one. It is fuelled by citizens feeling somewhat disenfranchised in their political as well as in their economic lives, insisting that their politics must be transparent, their representatives (liked or disliked) known to them and the inputs and outcomes of the political process clear – none of which is true of the EU. They don’t want to make war on Westminster, as many Trump supporters wish to on Washington, but instead to reclaim the House of Commons as the nation’s central political chamber \n\nFurther, to represent Britain as a country of uniquely foul community relations made worse by Brexit neither rings true anecdotally nor chimes with the facts. The Conservative government, responding to the Brexit-voting fears, has promised to reduce immigration to tens of thousands but still sees it as a source of economic, even social, advantage. The latest figures show that net immigration to the U.K. was nearly quarter of a million in the year ending December 2016. Among other European countries, Britain traditionally has had proportionately more foreign-born immigrants than three of the other four large European states – France, Italy and Spain – but fewer than the largest, Germany, and also fewer than Sweden, Austria and Ireland. Nearly all of these many thousands have passed into communities and workplaces with little backlash (if also sometimes little welcome) from native Brits.\n\nMORE FROM REUTERS\n\nLondon, whose popular mayor Sadiq Khan is the son of a working class British-Pakistani family, is among the most ethnically mixed cities in the world.\n\nA quarter of the population of Birmingham, England’s second city, was born abroad and two-thirds of its schoolchildren are non-white. Reaction to these demographics has not been uniformly benign. In 2011, widespread riots roiled London, Birmingham and other cities, with massive damage. Most people, however, didn't see the violence as racial. In some districts the rioters were mainly black; in others mainly white – reflecting the ethnic mix of the areas.\n\n Priti Patel, the government’s Secretary of State for International Development and a passionate Brexiteer, was born to a Ugandan Asian family. There are 12 members of parliament of African origin, two of whom – Labour’s Chuka Umunna and the Conservatives’ Adam Afriyie – are seen as serious contenders for their parties’ leadership.  \n\nThis isn't to describe an immigrants’ paradise. Immigration has been tightened sharply, illegal immigrants warned – from loudspeaker vans touring cities – to go home or face arrest, and there has been a rise in attacks on ethnic and religious minorities with both Brexit and anti-Semitism in the Labour Party held responsible.\n\nThese trends are bad – but they are also bad across Europe: Britain is European in its racism – though milder in it than most. It is a diverse country and it will remain a diverse, relatively tolerant place – with lapses. And it will remain “in” Europe. It has no choice. "],[8,"'End spatial apartheid': why housing activists are occupying Cape Town","Desperate for affordable housing, residents of South Africa’s second city have taken over a nurses’ home and a hospital – and drawn attention to how the country’s troubled history makes gentrification even more damaging\n\nGlitzy shopping arcades. Fine alfresco dining. A world class aquarium. A recently opened five-star hotel in a grain silo converted by Thomas Heatherwick’s studio, offering guests views of the harbour and Table Mountain through bulging “pillowed glass windows”. Those in the penthouse suite have paid the equivalent of up to £8,000 a night for the experience, dependent on the season.\n\nThis is Cape Town’s V&A Waterfront. One of South Africa’s most visited attractions, more than 24 million people flock to the centrally located harbour every year. But tourists needn’t wander far to be met with a grittier scene. Behind Somerset hospital – a historic public facility in neighbouring Green point which dates back to 1862 – large painted banners emblazoned “Reclaim the City” call for an end of segregation.\n\n“We’re into our second month now,” says Sheila Madikane proudly. “We don’t get rest time, because we are always between meetings, work, the occupation and our homes … if we have them. Even tonight I have to go back to my children because the electricity has run out. It’s all part of the struggle.”\n\nA domestic worker, Madikane is one of a small group of Cape Town residents who have moved into Helen Bowden nurses’ home – a large, disused building which once housed hospital workers. The occupiers are from all over Cape Town, but have one thing in common: lack of access to affordable housing in the city.\n\nAccording to local NGO Ndifuna Ukwazi, the average family in Cape Town could spend 300,000 rand (around £17,400) on a home, but the average sale price is more than three times this at 1 million rand. It means most working class households rely on renting, often in crime-ridden areas on the city’s periphery. And if they do live in well-located areas, their tenure security is put at risk by gentrification and steep rent increases.\n\nThe occupation began at the end of March when the Western Cape government announced plans to proceed with the sale of the Tafelberg building in nearby Sea Point, despite widespread opposition. It was deemed controversial in the context of Cape Town’s housing and segregation crisis – particularly because the province had declared the site feasible for social housing back in 2012.\n\nThe occupiers are refusing to accept the sale, and are demanding commitments from the provincial government to turn similar buildings in the city into social housing. In particular, they are hoping to convince Helen Zille, the premier of Western Cape. A political heavyweight within the Democratic Alliance (the increasingly popular centre-right opposition party), Zille is currently dealing with a charge from her own party following a series of tweets she wrote suggesting colonialism brought benefits to South Africa. Now, she’s up against a court case over Tafelberg, and Reclaim the City’s demands and “symbolic occupations” at Helen Bowden nurses’ home and Woodstock hospital – both publicly owned buildings earmarked for social housing, which remain abandoned.\n\nAt the Helen Bowden nurses’ home occupation I meet Reclaim the City supporter Unathi (not her real name). We take a walk around the area, which until recently she called home. Unathi was born in 1961 in Gugulethu, a township in the Cape Flats – an expansive area on the outskirts of the city where the apartheid regime built designated black and coloured (the word used in South Africa to describe people of mixed ancestry) townships.\n\nInitially too young to have much awareness of apartheid, she became interested in political activism as a teenager - around the time of the Soweto Uprising in 1976. After the regime fell, Unathi could have been a cover girl for social mobility in the new South Africa. She got a job in Cape Town as a parliamentary liaison officer, bringing up her children in inner-city suburbs. “I grew up in the township, but not one of my kids has ever attended a township school. That was very important for me.” But when she divorced, Unathi was hospitalised with depression and had to leave work. Since then, her income has been unstable. Unathi has financial support from her children who work at the Waterfront, but the prices in the area are becoming too high.\n\nShe recounts an incident of racism when moving into a new apartment in Sea Point. “I began moving my things in and the black caretaker said to me, ‘I don’t think you will stay here because people here are very racist’,” she explains. After just a few days staying in her new place Unathi met the tenant’s chairperson in the lift who asked her for information about which flat she was renting. When she went away for a few days to visit family, Unathi returned to find new tenants had moved into her flat. With no lease agreement, she had no choice but remove her things and leave.\n\nUnathi is now back in the Cape Flats in Langa township, where she lives with her family, including her infant grandson who she cares for most days. Apartheid spatial patterns repeat themselves here, as people like Unathi are pushed to the townships, living either in the homes of extended family (as she is) or in so-called government relocation camps: far from work opportunities and basic services.\n\nHaving lived another life she is deeply unhappy in Langa, where gang crime and sexual violence are a daily occurrence. A group of boys with knives recently targeted her 14-year-old grandson when she took him to buy school shoes; not recognising his face they assumed he was in a rival gang.\n\n“We don’t fit in much,” she sighs. “You are called names. When you go back to the township after living in a suburb it means you are doomed, and you must live with that.”\n\nThe Tafelberg property is located in Sea Point, 10 minutes’ walk along the coast from the Waterfront. Along the beachfront promenade, toddlers in pushchairs messily eat ice creams, lycra-clad runners speed past, couples sit on brightly coloured benches to admire the ocean view. This is where, for the past 30 years, occupier Sheila Madikane has lived, worked and raised three children. A desirable district due to its proximity to the sea and the inner city, Sea Point was reserved as a whites-only zone during apartheid, like much of central Cape Town.\n\nToday it is considerably more diverse, and despite increased crime in the 90s, it is now one of the most affluent parts of Cape Town. This has given rise to a different type of violence, occurring not on the streets but in the homes of working class, non-white people facing forced evictions. Madikane and her friends live in constant fear of this fate, and she is currently going through a court case to hold on to her home of 14 years.\n\n“Sea Point has changed a lot. Now it’s become a place for people to go shopping and go out to restaurants,” explains Madikane as she shows me around her neighbourhood, full of establishments that she doesn’t have the time or money to access, she says. “But the place changing doesn’t bother me. The only thing that bothers me is that they don’t want black and coloured people to live in the inner city. We want to make the city a mixed income place where all can stay, but the [Western Cape] government doesn’t want that. If they did, they would have given us these buildings a long time ago.”\n\nLike Sea Point and the Waterfront, in the east of the city Woodstock also attracts a steady flow of visitors, though of a slightly different ilk. A “grey” area under apartheid, it was one of the few central areas black and coloured people were able to live – but a rise in artist studios and cafes offering wifi and flat whites has increased property prices, and evictions. This is a familiar trend in European and American cities, but the history of Cape Town makes the effects of gentrification even more profound – before the spacial injustice of the past has been cured, more injustices are layered on top.\n\nReclaim the City activist and Woodstock local Charol is a petite, kind-faced woman who works as a cleaning supervisor. Her family moved to the area in the 1970s when they – and 60,000 others – were forcibly removed from District Six. One of the most infamous mass evictions of the apartheid era, the regime dismantled what was a hugely diverse and culturally rich community in the inner city.\n\nAfter the removal, life continued in nearby Woodstock, where Charol and her family benefited from access to work and good schools. But last year the bulldozers came – as the did in District Six all those years ago – and she was forced to leave. Her wooden house was demolished to make way for a shopping mall.\n\nWoodstock, one of the last remaining central areas where working class black and coloured communities live, is being fast lost to high-end property developers and businesses. Yet just a short walk from the train station lies the Woodstock Hospital building, which until the occupation was empty since the nineties and was deemed feasible for social housing as early as 2002.\n\nMeanwhile Charol, unable to afford rent in Woodstock, has been forced to live in the Cape Flats for the first time in her life. “It is so far from the city. I have to leave the house at 5am and I don’t get home till dark, when it’s not safe, and to bed until past midnight,” she says. Violent crime is rife in Manenberg, the township where she now lives, and Charol is particularly concerned about the future of her 22-year-old son Ashley. Having never been in trouble when they lived in Woodstock, after getting caught up in crime in Manenberg he is serving five years in jail for stealing a mobile phone.\n\nBut Charol refuses to give up hope. “I grew up in the inner city. My granny lived in District Six all her life … She fought for her rights, and my mum after her fought for her rights, so I’m not going to leave my rights behind. I am still fighting. This land belongs to me because of their fight.”\n\nThe racist spatial planning that built Cape Town means without deliberate attempts to rectify the past, segregation and gentrification continues at the expense of poorer non-white communities. By law, this shouldn’t be the case. Formed after the return to freedom in 1994, in section 25 of the South African constitution it says “there is a positive obligation on our government to redress land that is legally insecure because of past racial discriminatory patterns”, explains Chriscy Blouws, a lawyer at Ndifuna Ukwazi, the NGO coordinating the Reclaim the City campaign.\n\nBlouws says that technically in South Africa nobody can be evicted from their home without a court order – even if the tenant breaches a lease agreement. Protections like these seek to ensure human dignity and redress the unlawful dispossession of land that occurred during apartheid. But this law, which she describes as “a beautiful law, a beautiful right”, is not being implemented, and the government is “instead using an apartheid style of governance”.\n\nThese are the kind of arguments being made in the NGO’s lawsuit against the Western Cape government over the Tafelberg case. Using the building for social housing would be an easy way for the provincial government to kickstart spatial justice in Cape Town: Tafelberg is publicly owned, has been officially recommended for social housing (ideal accommodation for the many domestic workers in Sea Point, like Sheila), and the right laws are in place to make it happen.\n\n“We should be looking at long-term goals and even the profit you could eventually get from a mixed income social housing development,” says Blouws. “Instead, we are selling it off to private property developers so that we can extract more money from it.”\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, andexplore our archive here"],[8,"How to create your self-published e-book","In his third article in a series on self-publishing, author and digital publishing specialist Nik Peachey talks us through software, image choice, and formatting.\n\nOkay, so you have raised your funds and written your book. What do you do now? This is the point at which you would usually hand over your finished manuscript to your publisher, then sit back and wait for a publication date and your first royalty check.\n\nYour publisher would take your manuscript and start creating graphics, sourcing images, and mocking up design, before turning it into a ready-to-publish book.\n\nWith self-publishing, this is where you need to roll up your sleeves and start developing your new skills. For me, this is where things start to get interesting and creative.\n\nHow to transfer what you've written into a book format\n\nI’m a Mac user, so I normally do all of my writing using the Apple equivalent of Microsoft Word, which is Pages. But you can use either, or even create the text part of your manuscript using a plain text editor.\n\nDon’t start trying to format, design and lay out your text in the text editor to make it look nice. If you do, you are potentially creating more work for yourself later on. Layout, fonts and design are things you should deal with in your publishing software. It’s much better designed to do this, so keep things very simple at the writing stage.\n\nHow to choose the right software to create your book\n\nThere are a number of free and commercial options available. You should choose depending on how and where you want to publish your book, and how important the look and design of the book are to you.\n\nIf your e-book is only text and laid out quite simply, like the average novel, then you can easily export your file from your word-processing software to the .epub format. You should be able to upload that, along with a book cover, to a wide range of platforms. If, like me, you want to include illustrations, designs, and images, then you need something a bit more sophisticated.\n\nI use iBooks Author, partly because I’m a Mac user and it comes free and with my computer. But there are other reasons:\n\nIf you are a non-Mac user, or if you want to convert your book to an app for the Google Android platform, then you might also consider Kotobee. This is free software that you can download for Mac or PC. You use it to create interactive e-books that can be published in different formats, including desktop widgets for Mac or PC, as well as the iBook Store and Google Store.\n\nThe software itself isn’t as elegant or easy to use as iBooks Author, so expect to spend some time getting up to speed on it. But it can produce a book with a good range of interactive features, such as quizzes and videos, that make it much more engaging than a paper or PDF document book.\n\nIf you want to publish to Amazon, then you can download the free Kindle Textbook Creator. This runs on either Mac or PC and is pretty simple to use.\n\nThere are also a host of other free and 'freemium' (where the basic product is free, but extra features cost money) tools around that help you to create your book and make it look nice. These are just a few of the ones worth looking at: Booktype, Madmagz, and Active Textbook.\n\nCreating an e-book is easier than you might think\n\nThe actual process of creating the e-book can be quite simple, depending on which software you use and how interactive your e-book is. You’ll need to spend some time adjusting to it, but software like iBooks Author isn’t really any more complex to use than the average word-processing software.\n\nThe point at which it can become tricky is when you finish the e-book and want to push it live to the marketplace, but again that depends on which marketplaces you choose.\n\nFor example, iBook Store has quite a complex publishing process that includes having to create a new account with Apple and download extra software that creates your promotional page for the book on their site. Other platforms can be much easier to deal with, but we’ll examine this in detail in the next article.\n\nI googled and read a few blog posts and watched a couple of videos before getting my book onto the iBook Store. Be careful though: some of the posts I read made the process sound much more complex than it actually was, because they were offering commercial services to help.\n\nIf and when to hire a designer\n\nIf you are reading this and considering using clip-art images in your book, then I would say stop now and hire a designer.\n\nBut if you are willing to put in time to look at examples of good modern design and learn from these examples, then doing your own design can be a really rewarding experience. I’ve done all the design work on my own books and it’s something I really enjoy.\n\nIf you’re not sure, you could always invest in a good e-book about design. There are lots to choose from on Product Hunt, but be sure to read the reviews.\n\nTake advantage of special features for e-books\n\nIf you want to make your book move beyond what can be done with paper, then there are lots of options. You can add video, create an interactive glossary, different quizzes, 3D objects, images that zoom in and out, animation, polls, and questionnaires. In fact, you can add almost anything that you can find on a website or in an app.\n\nIf you want to see some examples of widgets, have a look at Bookry. This site specialises in interactive widgets for iBooks Author, and has a vast range of interaction and media type widgets.\n\nRisks to adding extra features\n\nThere are a few things, though, to be wary of.\n\nWhen I did an e-book on digital video, I decided just to drop video tutorials into some of the pages. Then, when I created the PDF version of the book, I placed images where the videos should go, linked them to the online video, and added QR codes so users could download the videos to a mobile device.\n\nThis took a little extra work but I think it was worth it to include this feature, because doing it another way might have meant totally recreating my e-book using another software tool. Sometimes you have to be prepared to make compromises.\n\nBe aware of copyright\n\nTeachers can be particularly lax when it comes to copyright and feel that anything they use is covered by fair use for educational purposes. Let’s be absolutely clear: this doesn’t apply to creating an e-book, especially if it’s going to be a commercial product.\n\nHere, there is one simple first principle: if you didn’t create it, then you don’t own it, so you can’t use it.\n\nAs with all rules, there are some exceptions. Some sources of images and videos allow for free commercial use. You can also ask for permission to use an image, video or text. You may well get it: I didn’t have a single refusal when I tried this, but it could take a long time and you may never get a reply.\n\nLastly, you could ‘risk it’. But if you do this and use something that you don’t have permission for, you may very well end up having to remove it or face legal action. Think very carefully before doing this.\n\nI used a lot of screen shots of websites. Even though I got permission from the site owners, in some cases, the content they host comes from various creators and they can’t give you permission for that third-party content. For example, you may get permission from a site or app owner to show part of their app, but it may include an image of a celebrity, for which you would need to get permission separately.\n\nCreate all your own content where possible\n\nYou should create all your own graphs, unless you can find the exact one you want and get permission to use it. Creating graphs and screen shots can be quite easy. I created all the graphs in my books using draw.io. This is a free browser-based tool that allows you to drag and drop various elements onto a canvas, and then save them as images.\n\nThere are lots of similar programs. If you want more traditional graphs, you can also use spreadsheet-type programmes like Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers, and use the images from there.\n\nI created and edited all of the screen shots using Skitch, which again is free and easy to use.\n\nFor the video tutorials I used Screen Flow, which is about $100. There are free apps available for creating video tutorials, but I prefer Screen Flow, as it’s versatile and can deliver high-quality results that I can easily edit.\n\nWhere to look for images\n\nFirst, I would say where not to find images, and that’s clip-art. Nothing says amateur more loudly than a clip-art image.\n\nIf you have a reasonably good digital camera, or even a decent smart phone, you can use free image-editing software and produce some near-professional results. I’ve taken many of the photos that I use in my own e-books. It also helps if you have some photogenic friends who are willing to model for you. However, avoid creating images that include people whose permission you don’t have, or which show brands or logos.\n\nIf you don’t think you can produce your own images, there are lots of sources of ‘free to use’ images that are published with attribute or non-attribute licenses for use in commercial products.\n\nTry Unsplash, Stocksnap, and Pixabay as good sources for photographic images.\n\nYou can find icons and image graphics that can be really effective at Icons8, Iconstore, and Freepik.\n\nThe main downside of these is that lots of people use them.

Cultural Marxists are regular guests on all the alphabet soup networks masquerading as real news, spewing their hatred, their disdain and disrespect for our President, and their calls to renewed violence in the streets through their masked Black Shirts.\n\nAs David Horrowitz said, “Worse yet, this is the dominant culture in our universities, in our media, in our judiciary, in government, in unions, and in the shadow political universe of non-profits, with billions of tax-free dollars at their disposal.”\n\nLanguage is a powerful tool of discourse, mass political indoctrination and agitation. Marxist Democrats are quite adept at using inflammatory language and deceptive euphemisms to suit their nefarious political ends.\n\nIn any kind of ideological and political war, the first victim is truth, replaced with lies, dressed cleverly by rhetoric, obfuscation, and intentional debasement of language.\n\nGeorge Orwell wrote an essay in 1946, “Politics and the English Language,” focusing on language which “is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.” Such language, often vague and meaningless, concealed the oppressive ideology.\n\nTaking private property from farmers and other owners is thus called “transfer of population” or “rectification of frontiers.” The process of sending people to gulags to die becomes “elimination of unreliable elements.” “Pacification” attempted to defend the indefensible acts of bombing and driving out locals from their ancestral lands and giving the land to a population protected by the intentions of the elites.\n\nOrwell pointed out that “the great enemy of clear language is insincerity.” The less sincere the speaker or writer is, particularly politicians and journalists, the more they “disguise their intentions behind euphemisms and convoluted phrasing.”\n\nAcademic writing is resplendent with “pretentious diction” and “meaningless words.” According to Orwell, “In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning.”\n\nConcurrent with “Politics and the English Language,” Orwell published “The Prevention of Literature.” The two essays reflect his alarm over the victimization of truth in the distorted use of language. Orwell pointed out the “deliberate use of misleading double-talk language among those he identified as pro-Soviet.” He predicted the type of literature under a future totalitarian society—“formulaic and low grade sensationalism.”\n\nAnalyzing some of the euphemisms conceived by today’s progressives, and I only scratched the surface, we realize that Orwell’s words from sixty years ago are still true.\n\n“Undocumented worker” is an obvious mischaracterization of illegal aliens who are invading our country with the approval of corporatist elites in both Democrat and Republican parties. These individuals do have documents from their countries of origin and have broken the law by crossing our borders illegally. Not only are they not repatriated, they are given equal rights with Americans so that corrupt politicians can stay in power in Democrat states like California. These people become illegal voters even though they do not speak the language, do not understand our laws, our Constitution, and do not care that they are helping transform our country into the hell hole they’ve fled. So long as they get undeserved welfare and Social Security benefits, they will vote Democrat in perpetuity.\n\n“Our core values” is Democrat double-speak for demographic and cultural suicide. We allow every unvetted flotsam and jetsam from around the world into our country, disregarding the interests of the American public, their safety, health, and well-being under the guise of “that is not who we are as a nation.” The Democrat Party and the leftist agenda are now making the decision of who we are as a nation and as people, without bothering to consult the rest of America.\n\nIf we want to uphold law and order, our borders, language, and culture, we are “bigoted.” The meaning of “bigoted” has been stretched and bastardized to now mean pretty much anything the left wants it to mean. Yet it seems that leftists are truly intolerant toward those holding different opinions. They often turn their intolerance into violence, silencing the opposition and their right to free speech especially in the bastions of liberal academia around the country.\n\nAdditionally, if you disagree with any goals of the leftist agenda, you are “racist.” The real meaning of “racism” as described in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities, and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race,” has been lost in the leftist double-talk.\n\nIf you want legal immigration and national borders, safe from criminals, gangs, disease, and jihadi intrusions, you are a “xenophobe.” All foreign-born individuals who are now proud American citizens and prefer that immigrants follow the rule of law just like they did, are accused of xenophobia, “undue fear of what is foreign and especially of people of foreign origin.”\n\nIf you condemn militant jihad, hijra, and Islamic violence, you are an “Islamophobe.” That word silences the opposition so that the liberal goal of unrestricted Islamic invasion continues.\n\nLiberals call themselves “progressives” even though their goals have nothing to do with progress but with regression to a totalitarian and oppressive communist society which has failed everywhere it has been tried. Liberals are repackaging the Bolshevik effort t by saying that communism was not implemented the right way.\n\n“Liberalism” does not really represent the meaning of the Latin word, “liber” (free). Liberalism is disguised incremental socialism that will eventually lead to global communism. “The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But under the name of “liberalism” they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation, without knowing how it happened.”\n\nPeople accept the word “global citizen” without ever asking themselves what it entails. A “global citizen” is an individual who lives in a country that is no longer a state; it has no borders, no sovereignty, no national identity, no passport, and no national history. Yet most schools and colleges advertise that their students have been brainwashed and prepared for global citizenship.\n\nOn campuses around the country, “snowflakes” are cowering and hiding in their “safe spaces” in fear of reality that contradicts what they’ve been told and taught since they were born and led across a stage and given participation trophies.\n\nThe word “inhumane” (without compassion for misery or suffering; cruel) has been trivialized to excuse any breaking of the law without punishment and repercussions. In the mentally disordered liberal brain, suffering the consequences of bad choices, decisions, and subsequent criminality has become cruel and “inhumane.”\n\nThe word “diversity” is no longer used as being diverse and different; it is now a liberal code word for perversity which must be acknowledged by the other side, encoded into law, and enforced by the courts.\n\nHomosexuality hides behind the word “gay” which previously meant “happy.” Different types of deviance are disguised behind the words “cross-dressers.” “Gender fluidity” can be interpreted as any sexual anomaly and psychological confusion—anything flows.\n\n“Multiculturalism” is the code word for the Cultural Marxism agenda and the transformation of your country into a tower of Babel of illegal immigrants who have no intention of assimilating or accepting the invaded culture, its laws, its history, and its language. It is considered “inhumane” to force such illegal aliens to assimilate and contribute to society in a meaningful way.\n\nLiberals force their ideas, plans, and global agenda on the rest of us in the name of “civil society.” This represents the globalist elites backed by power, influence, and money to socially engineer our lives any way they wish because they know best what is good for billions of people around the globe and the faux science backing them “has been settled.”\n\nThe laws and cries of “equal opportunity” coming from various special interest groups are not really asking for “equality,” they are asking for preferential treatment. And “social justice” is not asking for justice, it is asking for government sanctioned stealing, taking private property and money from those who worked for it and earned it, and giving it to those who did not earn it and are not entitled to it.\n\nSocial Security is not an “entitlement,” it is money that people have earned and contributed into a fund for decades in order to provide them with income in retirement. It is theft when Social Security money is given to illegal aliens as soon as they set foot on our soil.\n\nLiberals created special and protected categories for some races and ethnic groups such as calling Hispanic women “Latinas.” To my knowledge, Latium was a region in the former Roman Empire, thus those people could be called Latinas and Latini. Black people are now “African Americans” even though most of them have never set foot in Africa nor were they born there. Caucasians don’t call themselves European Americans. There are Africans who are American citizens and have every right to call themselves African Americans, including Caucasians from South Africa. These special categories are not necessary; they are divisive and counterproductive, treating the special group as a group that cannot survive without the force of government.\n\nIt seems that liberalism is not really freedom; it thrives on divisiveness, separation, and inequality. They use deceptive language, euphemisms, and lies to implement their goals and policies in the name of “democracy” even though we are not a democracy, we are a constitutional republic. But liberals count on their blind followers to be ignorant of history and civics."],[8,"Apple ready to talk up Siri at developers conference","For much of the iPhone’s first decade, the main canvas for developers has been its touchscreen: the face that launched a thousand apps. As Apple’s smartphone reaches its tenth anniversary, the company is starting to open up the iPhone’s ears and eyes to new apps too.\n\nAt Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference next week, the company is expected to up its game against Amazon’s voice-controlled Alexa and Google’s advances in computer vision, with new outlets for its own talking helper Siri and an overhaul of its iOS operating system.\n\nWhile recent previous annual gatherings of app makers have focused on software and services, Monday’s opening keynote address, led by Tim Cook, chief executive, could also see Apple unveil new hardware, including a Siri-powered hi-fi to compete head-on with Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home.\n\nWhen Phil Schiller, Apple’s marketing chief, was asked what he thought of those two voice-activated speakers by Indian news site NDTV last month, he replied: “My mother used to have a saying that if you don’t have something nice to say, say nothing at all.”\n\nAnalysts counter that one of Apple’s biggest causes for concern should be that its customers are not saying very much to Siri, either.\n\n“Right now, the perception is that Siri is the least good out of those out there, from Alexa to Google,” says Ben Bajarin, analyst at Silicon Valley researcher Creative Strategies. “They need to make sure people have the experience they expect from Apple with Siri or they run the risk of losing those consumers’ trust.”\n\nIn some situations, whispering into an iPhone’s ear can be a faster way to complete a task than tapping on a touchscreen.\n\nBut Siri faces the same challenge as other virtual assistants. While app icons are laid out on a display, it can be hard for consumers to know what a voice-based assistant can do. If users receive too many confounding replies, they tend to stop asking questions altogether.\n\nApple has slowly started to improve the range of tasks that Siri can carry out. At last year’s WWDC, which drew thousands of app developers from all over the world, Apple for the first time opened up Siri’s controls to outside companies such as Uber and Facebook, allowing customers to use their voices to book a ride or send a message to a friend.\n\nAnalysts estimate that the number of apps taking advantage of this facility remains in the hundreds or low thousands, compared with more than 10,000 Alexa “skills” available for the Amazon Echo.\n\nApple often opts for quality over quantity, constricting what developers can do in the early days of a new platform to ensure what it sees as a good user experience.\n\nSo far, Apple has limited third-party access to Siri to a handful of app categories, including communications (Facebook and Skype), ride-hailing services (Uber, Lyft and Didi), payments (PayPal and Square), tracking workouts and photo searches. Siri can also be used to control some smart-home devices such as lightbulbs and thermostats using Apple’s Homekit platform. Mr Cook says he tells Siri to turn on his lights and make the coffee every morning.\n\nNow that Apple and its developers have all had a chance to learn from that test group, many expect Siri will be opened up to a broader range of apps — not least to create more reasons for consumers to buy that “Siri speaker”, which is expected to go on sale later in the year.\n\n“In this case, it behoves Apple to be late,” says Danielle Levitas of app researcher App Annie, as it allows it to learn from other companies’ mis-steps in what is still a nascent field. “It’s too important for them to screw up. But if you do it late, you’d better be better.”\n\nOne large Silicon Valley company that has hooked its iPhone app into Siri, but asked not to be named, said that usage through the virtual assistant has been “meaningful and growing”. This app has seen a fivefold increase in the number of requests completed via Siri in the first six months of this year, compared with the end of 2016.\n\nAnalysts say that many Alexa skills, by contrast, are of limited utility and receive little attention from Echo owners.\n\n“These are really music speakers that you can control with your voice,” says Mr Bajarin. “That’s the largest use case by far.”\n\nApple is also expected to start doing more with visual inputs. Facebook and Google, at their own recent developer conferences, have pushed out new platforms that use AI to let a smartphone’s camera recognise objects in photographs or overlay digital images on top of the real world, using a technique known as “augmented reality”.\n\nThe iPhone’s camera is expected to gain similar features over the coming months. Here, as with Siri, Apple is likely to open that platform to developers gradually and carefully.\n\nAdding new senses is of little value, though, if the iPhone’s brain does not improve too. Mr Bajarin expects the next version of the phone’s operating software to see “fundamental changes”.\n\n“A heavy theme is going to be how the software is becoming more smart,” he says. “It’s a learning operating system that knows about you specifically. I expect a high level of personalisation and customisation, as it starts to become more proactively intelligent.”"],[8,"World has three years left to stop dangerous climate change, warn experts","Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres among signatories of letter warning that the next three years will be crucial to stopping the worst effects of global warming\n\nAvoiding dangerous levels of climate change is still just about possible, but will require unprecedented effort and coordination from governments, businesses, citizens and scientists in the next three years, a group of prominent experts has warned.\n\nWarnings over global warming have picked up pace in recent months, even as the political environment has grown chilly with Donald Trump’s formal announcement of the US’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement. This year’s weather has beaten high temperature records in some regions, and 2014, 2015 and 2016 were the hottest years on record.\n\nBut while temperatures have risen, global carbon dioxide emissions have stayed broadly flat for the past three years. This gives hope that the worst effects of climate change – devastating droughts, floods, heatwaves and irreversible sea level rises – may be avoided, according to a letter published in the journal Nature this week.\n\nThe authors, including former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, argue that the next three years will be crucial. They calculate that if emissions can be brought permanently lower by 2020 then the temperature thresholds leading to runaway irreversible climate change will not be breached.\n\nFigueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, under whom the Paris agreement was signed, said: “We stand at the doorway of being able to bend the emissions curve downwards by 2020, as science demands, in protection of the UN sustainable development goals, and in particular the eradication of extreme poverty. This monumental challenge coincides with an unprecedented openness to self-challenge on the part of sub-national governments inside the US, governments at all levels outside the US, and of the private sector in general. The opportunity given to us over the next three years is unique in history.”\n\nSchellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, added: “The maths is brutally clear: while the world can’t be healed within the next few years, it may be fatally wounded by negligence [before] 2020.”\n\nScientists have been warning that time is fast running out to stave off the worst effects of warming, and some milestones may have slipped out of reach. In the Paris agreement, governments pledged an “aspirational” goal of holding warming to no more than 1.5C, a level which it is hoped will spare most of the world’s lowest-lying islands from inundation. But a growing body of research has suggested this is fast becoming impossible.\n\nParis’s less stringent, but firmer, goal of preventing warming from exceeding 2C above pre-industrial levels is also in doubt.\n\nThe authors point to signs that the trend of upward emissions is being reversed, and to technological progress that promises lower emissions for the future. Renewable energy use has soared, creating a foundation for permanently lowering emissions. Coal use is showing clear signs of decline in key regions, including China and India. Governments, despite Trump’s pronouncements, are forging ahead with plans to reduce greenhouse gases.\n\nThe authors called for political and business leaders to continue tackling emissions and meeting the Paris goals without the US. “As before Paris, we must remember that impossible is not a fact, it’s an attitude,” they wrote.\n\nThey set out six goals for 2020 which they said could be adopted at the G20 meeting in Hamburg on 7-8 July. These include increasing renewable energy to 30% of electricity use; plans from leading cities and states to decarbonise by 2050; 15% of new vehicles sold to be electric; and reforms to land use, agriculture, heavy industry and the finance sector, to encourage green growth.\n\nProf Gail Whiteman said the signs from technical innovation and economics were encouraging: “Climate science underlines the unavoidable urgency of our challenge, but equally important is the fact that the economic, technical and social analyses show that we can resoundingly rise to the challenge through collective action.”\n\nWhile the greenhouse gases poured into the atmosphere over the last two centuries have only gradually taken effect, future changes are likely to be faster, scientists fear. Johan Rockström of the Stockholm Resilience Centre said: “We have been blessed by a remarkably resilient planet over the past 100 years, able to absorb most of our climate abuse. Now we have reached the end of this era, and need to bend the global curve of emissions immediately, to avoid unmanageable outcomes for our modern world.”"],[8,"Why Macron is wrong about Assad","There is much to celebrate in Emmanuel Macron's ascent to the French presidency. The election was a resounding defeat for the forces of reaction. Macron conducted himself with decency and intelligence and achieved his victory without submitting to the prevailing xenophobic impulse. In acknowledging France's imperial excesses, in standing up to Vladimir Putin, and in resisting Donald Trump's provocations, he seemed to herald a bold new politics that would align power with principle.\n\nSince assuming power, however, Macron's statements have been more equivocal. His recent comments on Syria suggest that in the balance between ideals and pragmatism, the president is leaning heavier on the latter. Speaking to the European press, Macron announced his break with past policy. \"I haven't said the deposing of Bashar al-Assad is a prerequisite for everything,\" he said. \"Because no one has introduced me to his legitimate successor!\" Instead, he emphasised the need for\"a political and diplomatic roadmap\"; because, \"We won't solve the question only with military force.\"\n\nThe cliche about military force would be meaningful, if it came from the party that is committed to military victory. But the monopoly on violence in Syria is held by the regime and its allies, Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah. Together, they are responsible for over 90 percent of all civilian deaths. The West has deployed its military force primarily against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) and al-Qaeda, and, occasionally, also against anti-Assad fighters (often indiscriminately). France has never confronted Assad; and only under Trump has the US tackled the regime in five rare instances, the most significant being the cruise missile strike on the Shayrat airbase after the sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun.\n\nFor the leader of France to foreswear military force in Syria is quite meaningless. The real question is if Assad, Russia and Iranaccept that there is no military solution. They don't.\n\nIt is also not necessary for Syrians to produce a legitimate leader before they can rid themselves of a decidedly illegitimate one. The very cause of the conflict in Syria is that citizens were denied the right to elect legitimate leaders. Which is what makes Macron's next statement puzzling. \"Democracy isn't built from the outside without the people,\" he says. But in Syria, people inside were trying to build democracy. The only assistance they asked for was not to be gassed, starved, tortured or disappeared in the process.\n\nTo avoid having to address the present, Macron reverts to the past and refers to the debacles in Iraq and Libya. \"What was the result of those interventions?\" he asks. \"Failed states where terrorist groups prospered.\" \n\nBut the Iraq war had nothing in common with Libya, let alone with Syria. There was no popular uprising in 2003 and nor was there an imminent humanitarian crisis. Saddam had committed his worst crimes in the 1980s and 90s. In Libya, France intervened, with UN support, to prevent an imminent slaughter and75 percent of the Libyan population approved. The subsequent disaster had less to do with Muammar Gaddafi's removal than with the failure to help consolidate Libya's nascent democracy, leaving it vulnerable to domestic and foreign subversion - France's included. If Iraq and Libya have turned into \"failed states where terrorist groups prospered\", it's mainly because the logic of the \"war on terror\" has trumped the logic of democracy and human rights.\n\nIt is in Syria, however, that Macron's argument really founders. If Iraq shows that unprovoked action has consequences, Syria proves that inaction in the face of provocation, too, can lead to disaster. The war Syrian has killed over a half-million people,over five million have fled and 6.3 million are internally displaced.\n\nThe root of the Syrian crisis is the Syrian regime; ISIL is its mere symptom. Committing to fight the latter while ignoring the former is not \"realism\", it is wishful thinking. Macron has been at his most effective when he speaks from principle. His reiteration of his red line - which he has now expanded to also include humanitarian corridors - is a welcome development. But if he believes that Assad is merely an enemy of the Syrian people, then he needs to be reacquainted with John Donne's admonition: no man is an island.\n\nIn 2013, Barack Obama also thought Assad was someone else's problem and walked away from his redline. With this residual constraint lifted, the regime escalated its violence and killed nearly four times as many people in the two years after the chemical attack as it had in the two years before. This was the turning point that discredited Assad's democratic opposition, empowered the Islamists, and led to the rise of ISIL. It was also the moment when the refugees' flight spiked. The overflow from this deluge trickling into Europe sparked the xenophobic backlash that the far right has exploited across the West; and, while the brunt of ISIL terror is born by Syrians and Iraqis, Europe, too, became a target of its indiscriminate fury.\n\nMacron should know, because in the same interview he criticised Obama for failing to enforce his redline, creating a vacuum that was filled by the forces of reaction. But that abdication is not a historical detail: Its effects continue to fester.\n\nSyria will never be at peace as long as Assad remains in power. Over half of Syria's population will be unable to return home for fear of reprisal (and why wouldn't Assad seek and destroy his enemies, since he has learned that there is literally no crime that he cannot get away with). ISIL will be defeated, but the morbid symptoms it embodies may take even more grotesque form unless the underlying cause is addressed. \n\nIn the interview, Macron spoke eloquently of Europe's love of justice; he also spoke of democracy, individual freedoms and social justice; and he warned of the threat of authoritarian regimes. The Syrians who rose up against Syria's authoritarian regimeshare these principles. Macron's words will ring hollow if he allows these people to be crushed and authoritarians everywhere will be emboldened, taking this as license to ruthlessly quash dissent.\n\nWhat Assad has done in Syria is not a crime against Syrians alone, it is a crime against humanity. It is not for Syria alone that the bell tolls, it tolls for all of us. Macron says he rejects neoconservative interventionism; but he needs to be just as leery of \"realist\" lack of imagination. It was the pursuit of \"stability\" after all that gave us the Mubaraks, Saddams and Assads. The aggravating dissonance will persist until the West learns to side with citizens instead of their oppressors. \n\nMuhammad Idrees Ahmad is Lecturer in Digital Journalism at the University of Stirling.

But even if that can be tackled, they will have to fight humans for land, food and water\n\nIt is the dead of night. The day’s red-dust heat has given way to a cooling breeze. A hundred frogs chirp urgently. Tim and his crew are preparing for another stealth raid. Their mission is highly dangerous and now there’s a new threat: armed men are following them.\n\nThis is the scene repeated nightly on the eastern fringes of Amboseli national park in Kenya, close to the border with Tanzania. Tim is an elephant who, along with a group of up to 12 other males, has developed a taste for the tomatoes and maize growing on local farms on the outskirts of the park. The armed men are park rangers who have been tasked with keeping him from the crops – and saving his life.\n\nThe nocturnal game of cat and elephant is just one example of a much bigger problem playing out across Africa and Asia. It is the sharp end of an existential conflict between people and wildlife for land, food and water. It is also a departure from the traditional story of elephant conservation, which presents the big threat to the world’s largest land animal as ivory poachers and the trinket-buyers in Chinese bazaars. The ivory trade has had a significant impact, for sure, but habitat destruction caused by human population growth and development is a far more pervasive threat.\n\n“Poaching attracts a lot of media attention, but it’s only part of a big picture,” says Julian Blanc of the UN Environment Programme in Nairobi, Kenya. “If we somehow stopped poaching tomorrow, elephants would still be in big trouble.” Habitat loss in Africa threatens many other species too, from giraffes to geckos.\n\nPreventing habitat loss is a harder cause for celebrities and campaigning NGOs to champion (although some do). It is a more subtle narrative, full of shades of grey rather than the black-and-white certainties of the ivory trade.\n\nIt was easy for animal lovers to say “not in my name” while denouncing the buyers who fuel poaching. But consumers in the developed world and their governments also have an impact on elephant habitat through the goods that we buy and the development schemes that our governments fund.\n\nA commercial enterprise growing fruit or flowers, for example, on land that was once elephant habitat contributes just as surely to the population’s decline as a poacher’s bullet – even if the connection may not be so immediate or so direct.\n\nThe moral argument is complex because the consumers, NGOs or governments that support such businesses are also helping to lift hundreds or thousands of people out of poverty by providing them with a livelihood. But from a conservation point of view it is often a zero-sum game: humans win, wildlife loses.\n\n“In essence, the elephant story in Africa encompasses many aspects of your life,” says Holly Dublin, chair of the African elephant specialist group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. “That’s how complex it is. You are implicated in this. Not just bad people who buy ivory.”\n\nConflict between humans and elephants is most acute in Asia. Every year, around 100 people and 40 to 50 elephants are killed as a result in India, for example.\n\nBut the problem is set to escalate sharply in Africa as development gathers pace. Governments here bear primary responsibility for wildlife stewardship, but conservation is getting harder by the year as populations increase and more infrastructure such as roads and railways is built to service the continent’s growing economy. These provide barriers to wildlife migrations, which are particularly important for elephants. Some groups have home ranges of over 3,000 sq km.\n\nUnderstanding the impact of this new infrastructure will require more research. One such study has already begun in Kenya, to investigate how elephants are reacting to the newly opened (pdf) Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) between the capital Nairobi and the coastal city of Mombassa. The route runs parallel to a major road for much of its length.\n\nThe 23,000 sq km Tsavo ecosystem, comprising Tsavo East and Tsavo West national parks, which is bisected by the railway, is home to between 12,000 and 14,000 elephants – Kenya’s largest population.\n\nAlthough engineers have created six 70m-wide underpasses to act as wildlife crossing points (there are other bridges and culverts where wildlife may be able to cross too), researchers are worried that if elephants don’t use them the population will be cut in two. “98% of the ecosystem connectivity has now been blocked,” says Ben Okita-Ouma, head of monitoring at the NGO Save the Elephants.\n\nTo understand the impact on the animals, Okita-Ouma’s team has fitted 10 elephants with radio collars and tracked their movements. The results are preliminary but the team found evidence the animals were wandering up and down the railway line, apparently looking for crossing locations. At times they even climbed over the railway embankment, crossing the tracks and destroying fences in the process.\n\nOkita-Ouma believes the elephants and other animals will begin to learn where the crossing points are, but this will lead to high densities of wildlife at those points. That will potentially lead to more contact with humans, and accidents on the busy highway that runs alongside the SGR.\n\nOkita-Ouma says illegal settlements are growing around some of these underpasses. “The government needs to come in quickly and with a lot of force to ensure that the illegal settlements are completely removed.” That will likely save human and elephant lives.\n\nThe pilot study also recommends creating wildlife overpasses on the road near the railway crossing points.\n\nA more widespread issue as Africa’s human population grows is that the competition for land is becoming more intense. “If you need that land for people, it’s going to compromise the wildlife,” says Dublin, who asks, “what’s the plan” for these large blocks of land that both wildlife and people depend on?\n\nAccording to the 2013 Elephants in the Dust report by a group of conservation NGOs, an estimated 29% of the animals’ known and possible range is heavily affected by human development. That figure is predicted to rise to 63% by 2050.\n\nAt present, much development happens without any planning oversight – often with piecemeal encroachment by arable farmers into land that was previously wild. In other cases – for example Laikipia in Kenya – there have been mass incursions into wildlife conservancies prompted by pastoralists in search of grazing for their drought-starved cattle. This brings humans and wildlife into conflict, with dangerous consequences.\n\n“Elephants are not quite the gentle giants that many people in the west perceive them to be,” says Blanc. “They destroy crops, they kill people, often without provocation – they are one of the top killers of people in Africa.”\n\n“One elephant is enough to destroy a year’s worth of crops for a multitude of families and create a lot of economic hardship,” he adds.\n\nOne approach is to manage that conflict where it happens. That’s where the night-time attempts to save Tim from his own appetite come in.\n\nHe has been radio-collared by scientists who, with the help of park rangers, are trying to prevent him and other males from raiding crops on farms that fringe the park.\n\n“What we’re trying to do with this early warning system is to respond faster because we can anticipate crop raiding,” explains Ryan Wilkie of Save the Elephants. The response consists of nocturnal patrols by rangers equipped with pepper-pellet guns, thunderflash grenades and a deafening horn.\n\n“He’s definitely incredibly smart. I mean I’m enamoured of this elephant – just trying to understand how he’s thinking … He’s certainly a very intelligent and strategic thinker,” says Wilkie.\n\nImportant though the efforts to protect Tim from himself are (he has been speared by angry farmers three times in his crop-raiding career), it would be impossible to scale this approach up to the 415,000 or so elephants on the continent. And as the pressure on habitat grows, some elephant conservationists are arguing for a more radical, continent-wide approach.\n\n“By the time you get to the space where people and elephants are in conflict and you’re trying to mitigate there, you’re just talking about taking an aspirin for cancer,” says Dublin. Move one group of crop-raiding elephants and it will be replaced by another.\n\nWith Africa’s population set to double by 2050 from 1.2 billion now (it was 477 million in 1980), Dublin argues that countries must get ahead of human-wildlife conflict and create large-scale land-use plans to allow people and animals to coexist. The alternative will be a conservation disaster.\n\n“Nobody’s doing any spatial planning,” Dublin complains. “That fact that you are getting elephants and humans into such close contact with each other again and again means that planners were not thinking long-term enough.”\n\nBut before they can make those longer-term plans for how land will be used, policymakers need better information about where the flashpoints are likely to be. Because elephants roam so widely, protecting the territory they need will also benefit other species.\n\nDublin is embarking on a major project to combine data on elephant population ranges with information about human development. Where is human population growing fastest on the continent? How are humans and elephants likely to move in response to climate change? Where are major agriculture and infrastructure schemes planned? The aim, she says, is to identify “the areas for highest probability of conflict and the areas for the highest probability of coexistence”.\n\nThe project is likely to take a couple of years to complete, but smaller-scale studies are already revealing the choices that must be made between animal welfare and human development. In Kenya, there are calls from conservationists to alter the planned Lamu Port, South Sudan, Ethiopia Transport (Lapsset) development corridor. The $29bn (£23bn) project involves a new port, highways, railways, airports, pipelines and three new resort cities, and is a key pillar in Kenya’s development plans. But consultants carrying out an environmental impact assessment of one of the proposed resort cities at Isiolo, in the centre of the country, have recommended that it be moved elsewhere to avoid disrupting elephant habitat and an important migration corridor. Investors who have already bought land in the area are likely to fiercely resist the change, so whether the plans are modified will be a major test of Lapsset’s environmental credentials.\n\nOkita-Ouma says that across the continent, development almost always trumps conservation. Governments “have got to take into account the needs for wildlife in a much more serious manner”, he says. “At the moment very little action is taking place, and if there is any action then it isn’t what you require and want to see.”\n\nDublin predicts that with the pressure on habitat growing, there will be more tough choices ahead: “Sadly, I think what you are going to find is that much of the elephant range is going to be under siege. I mean, look what the plans are for Africa. Elephants live where there’s water. So does agriculture. So do humans. It will be difficult to have it all.”\n\nAs part of our series on elephant conservation, we’re investigating the impact of human development on wildlife habitat in Africa and Asia.Please get in touch via elephant.conservation@theguardian.com"],[8,"Grenfell Tower residents say managers 'brushed away' fire safety concerns","Questions raised about ‘dangerous living conditions’ as landlord ordered changes to way it handled fire risk in its properties\n\nResidents of Grenfell Tower have said they raised multiple concerns about the risk of fire in the months before the fatal blaze at the building, but were “brushed away” by the council’s tenant management organisation.\n\nSurvivors of the disaster said on Wednesday they had raised fears about the fact that there was only one escape route. They also told the Kensington and Chelsea tenant management organisation (KCTMO) of their concerns over the placement of boilers and gas pipes, the absence of a building-wide fire alarm or sprinkler system, and piles of rubbish being dumped and causing a fire risk.\n\nInvestigations have begun into the cause of the fire and how it swept so rapidly up the tower’s 24 storeys, apparently spreading across a new thermal cladding system installed last year as part of a £10m refurbishment.\n\nOnly last November, the Grenfell Action Group warned of “dangerous living conditions” and said: “It is a truly terrifying thought but the Grenfell Action Group firmly believe that only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord, the KCTMO.”\n\nIn the same month, the Guardian has learned, KCTMO placed fire safety issues across its estate under review and ordered multiple changes to the way it handled fire risk in its properties. As well as tackling hoarding and clutter in communal areas, it said it would speed up the installation of self-closing doors.\n\nThe disaster has sparked a review by construction professionals of dozens of similar refurbishment projects involving recladding that have been undertaken in recent years. One architect said he had placed the design of a dozen towers under review. The policing and fire minister, Nick Hurd, also announced checks would be carried out on projects currently under way.\n\nAs well as examining the cladding at Grenfell Tower, another line of inquiry is likely to be whether gas pipes triggered or exacerbated the blaze.\n\nFirefighters, fire safety experts and architects all voiced alarm about the speed at which the fire swept across the new polyester powder-coated aluminium facade, installed as part of the refurbishment to improve the building’s insulation and appearance.\n\n“I don’t think we have seen this sort of fire in the UK before,” said Mike Penning, former fire minister in David Cameron’s government. “We have to check if the existing regulations have been adhered to and it looks to me, from a distance, that that may not be the case.”\n\nIn March, local councillor Judith Blakeman, who sits on the KCTMO board, raised residents’ fears about the installation by the National Grid of gas pipes in the main stairwells. The landlord assured her they would be boxed in with “fire-rated” protection, but this was not done, Blakeman said. She also said she requested an independent safety adjudication of the building, but this was declined.\n\n“I was treated like I was a nuisance,” she said. “I raised 19 complaints on behalf of individual residents. Every single time we were told that the board had satisfied itself that the fire safety was fine.”\n\nDavid Collins, a member of the Grenfell Tower residents’ association, said it had “repeatedly reported concerns to the tenant management organisation of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, including fire safety concerns which were not investigated during the regeneration works”.\n\nHe said there were “concerns over locations of boilers, concerns about escape, concerns about fire escape lighting – the list goes on”.\n\n“I spoke to councillors and they refused to investigate,” Collins said. “They wouldn’t believe that the residents were concerned. Ninety percent of residents signed an independent petition asking for there to be an investigation into the organisation that runs this building because they were so incompetent. And the council turned it down.”\n\nThe KCTMO said in a statement: “We are aware that concerns have been raised historically by residents. We always take all concerns seriously and these will form part of our forthcoming investigations. While these investigations continue with our cooperation, our core priority at the moment is our residents.”\n\nThe organisation said it was “too early to speculate what caused the fire and contributed to its spread”.\n\nLater, the chief executive of KCTMO, Robert Black, told ITV News London that he and his colleagues were “in complete shock”. He said: “I’ve been here since 3.30 this morning working on the ground, it’s part of my job ... trying to actually manage the outcome of that devastation and make sure people are covered and they’ve got somewhere to go tonight.\n\n“As a tenant management organisation, we do listen to people and we have listened to people and that’s what we’re doing,” he went on. Asked to comment on observations that the cladding on the tower may have added to the speed and intensity at which the fire spread, he said: “We had no expectation this would happen, we are absolutely devastated by it.”\n\nThe council has admitted it received complaints over the refurbishment. Asked whether the council had received complaints and was acting on them, the leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Nick Paget-Brown, said: “I think that’s going to have to be looked at in even more detail during the investigation behind this.\n\n“But it is perfectly true that Grenfell Tower underwent a major refurbishment programme, starting about two and a half years ago, to improve the hot water system, to improve the heating, to improve insulation, put in new windows, new external cladding, to improve the quality of life for people who were living there.”\n\nRydon, the contractor for the refurbishment, said it “met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards”.\n\nThe architect was Studio E. In a statement, they said: “We are deeply shocked and distressed over news of the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower. Our thoughts are with those that have been affected by this tragic incident, together with all of their relatives and friends. Given the ongoing nature of the incident, it would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate further at this stage. We will be available to assist the relevant authorities as and when we are required.”\n\nOne architect, who has been responsible for several recladding projects, said the tower’s cladding was designed to include fire-breaks at every floor and around every window. He said that if the cladding were installed correctly, flames should not be able to sweep through the cavities.\n\nEyewitnesses including Beinazir Lasharie, councillor for Notting Dale ward, where the fire struck, told the Guardian the cladding appeared “very flammable”.\n\n“The flames were working their way up and it seemed like the cladding had caught fire,” she said. “That is how it spread.”\n\nLasharie said residents often had meetings with the KCTMO and the organisation would “brush away” their worries.\n\nExperts voiced differing opinions on the role of the cladding, which fell off in blazing chunks. According to planning documents, it was constructed from units called Reynobond rainscreen cassettes and was installed by Harley Facades Limited. The company declined to comment “until we have more information ourselves”, but described the blaze as “devastating”.\n\nThe London fire commissioner, Dany Cotton, said: “I do not want to speculate about the cause of the fire or what has caused it to spread in the way that it did.”\n\nAccording to board papers for November 2016, KCTMO was handed a “deficiency notice” last year by the London fire brigade after an audit at another of its properties – Lonsdale House on the Portobello Court estate. The notice related to flat entrance doors and the requirement for regular inspections of self-closing devices.\n\n“Before the regeneration, people raised concerns about how it was going to be made safe,” said Cllr Lasharie, speaking about Grenfell Tower. “Once it was done, the finishing wasn’t done properly. People were worried there was only one fire exit, that there was rubbish being left at the bottom of the tower where dumping was going on, open wires when the works were being done. They were concerned there was no proper evacuation process, no proper fire alarm for everyone to hear and there’s no sprinkler system.”\n\nShe said boilers were left “bare” in living rooms and kitchens. “It was poor work.”\n\n“People were worried from the start about the safety and the workmanship,” she said. “This is the worst thing that could have happened. People have died.”"],[8,"China and the Closing of the Ivory Trade","On the last day of March, the State Forestry Administration, the Chinese agency that monitors the trade in elephant ivory, closed sixty-seven ivory factories and retail outlets across the country. This was the first phase of a larger plan—announced by the government of China, without fanfare, on December 30, 2016—to end the legal trade of elephant ivory within the nation altogether and thus to close the world’s largest elephant-ivory market. (By some estimates, China accounts for seventy per cent of the market for illegal ivory poached in Africa.) Under the government’s plan, the remaining ivory factories and outlets will be shuttered by the end of 2017.\n\nInside Africa, the effort to control the massacre of elephants has devolved into an escalating war between poachers—who are increasingly well armed and often tied to criminal syndicates—and conservationists, who, in defense of elephants, routinely deploy mercenaries, automatic weapons, advanced intelligence-gathering techniques, drones, and sniffer dogs. For all these efforts, the over-all situation of elephants has steadily worsened. In August of last year, Paul Allen’s Vulcan Foundation released the results of its Great Elephant Census, which found that the numbers of Africa’s savanna elephants had declined by almost a third between 2007 and 2014, and that only some three hundred and fifty thousand remain. Forest elephants, Africa’s other elephant species, are in even worse shape, with perhaps only eighty thousand remaining. Many people began to talk about regional extinction.\n\nWhile efforts to control poaching within Africa are fundamental to preserving the species, conservationists increasingly agree that the only real way to defeat the massacre of elephants is to control demand. This has proved difficult because China, the end market of most illegal ivory, has been, until recently, reluctant to restrain its domestic ivory market.\n\nIn 2007, in the early years of the ivory boom, China listed ivory carving as an “intangible cultural heritage.” Ivory ownership became an important status symbol for the new middle class. (As the journalist and activist Hongxiang Huang explained, “If you owned an ivory piece, you’d really arrived.”) In subsequent years, the price of ivory soared, reaching twenty-one hundred dollars per kilogram, in 2014. But as prices rose the market changed. Daniel Stiles, an ivory analyst, believes that, in recent years, the ivory market in China has been driven not by the upwardly mobile middle class but by speculators betting on the extinction of elephants, which would drive prices still higher.\n\nBut, in those same years, China, too, has changed. Xi Jinping, confirmed as President in early 2013, speaks less about ivory as an intangible cultural heritage than about his ambition for China to become an “ecological civilization.” The rapacity of China’s ivory merchants and the poaching industry they supported were giving the country a bad name. Perhaps especially embarrassing was a report that, during Xi’s inaugural trip to Africa, in 2013, his political and business entourage took advantage of their diplomatic status to load his plane down with thousands of kilograms of illegal ivory.\n\nIn 2014 the government publicly destroyed six tons of confiscated ivory, and the next year the government announced that it would curtail the ivory trade, although it did not say when. All this may have been motivated, as Andrea Crosta, the executive director of the Elephant Action League, put it to me, “less by a love of elephants than by the considerable embarrassment the ivory trade has caused the nation.” But it represents change nonetheless.\n\nWithin China, President Xi’s resolve has already made a difference. Between 2014 and February of this year, the price of ivory in China dropped more than sixty per cent from its 2014 high, down to seven hundred and thirty dollars per kilogram, according to a recent report by Save the Elephants.\n\nThis may just be the bottom falling out of the speculative market, but, as Crosta said, “After all the noise the government has made, I think they’ll be serious. The government is good at shutting down what it wants to shut down.”\n\nDoes the closing of the legal trade in China mean the end of the crisis for Africa’s elephants? Unfortunately, there’s little that's predictable about the ivory market in China. Richard Leakey, the chairman of the Kenya Wildlife Service (who, in 1993, lost both legs in a suspected act of sabotage by poachers), referred to China’s plan as the “death knell for the ivory trade.” But other conservationists are not convinced. Legal ivory in China is distributed through government-licensed retail outlets and factories—the same ones that the government is now closing. But many of these outlets have, over the years, come to serve as fencing operations for greater quantities of illegal ivory. As much as ninety per cent of the ivory sold in China each year is thought to be illegal, and much of that flows through the government’s legally sponsored outlets. Conservationists fear that closing the legal outlets could lead illegal sales to migrate elsewhere, including to the Internet, where they would be more difficult to track. As Stiles recently put it in the Guardian, banning the sale of legal ivory in China could merely lead to a situation in which “the illegal ivory that consumers buy will increase from 90 to 100% of the market.”\n\nGeorge Wittemyer, the chair of the scientific board of Save The Elephants, said that in Kenya, where he works, prices of ivory had dropped off substantially but were still high enough to drive poaching. “The concern I hear,” he told me, “is that ivory consumption might be moving out of China to neighboring countries, with Hong Kong in particular being a problem.”\n\nHong Kong sells more pieces of ivory than any other city*, and ninety per cent of its customers are reportedly from mainland China. The Hong Kong government has announced that it, too, will shut down its ivory outlets—but not until 2021—and it is only beginning to negotiate details. This has led to a situation, as Crosta put it, in which “the main consuming country is supposed to stop buying ivory by the end of the year, while the main hub serving those consumers is allowed to keep operating for another four years.”\n\nBut, even if the closing of China’s markets does diminish the pressure on elephants, there are other concerns within Africa. A persistent drought tied to global warming has spread south out of the Sahel, leading to the desertification of large areas of rangeland. Jon Lee Anderson recently wrote about Kenya’s Laikipia Valley, where heavily armed pastoralists drove their herds onto conservation land, killing wildlife as they went. Witnesses reported dead elephants, buffaloes, zebras, and giraffes scattered across the landscape.\n\nIn February, the Vatican hosted a conference on biological extinction. Participants noted that one in five of the world’s species already faces extinction, and that proportion could rise to fifty per cent by the end of the century. The Cambridge University economist Sir Partha Dasgupta noted that Africa was particularly susceptible. “Africa’s population is likely to go from roughly one billion now to around four billion,” he said. “Can you imagine what tensions are going to be there, especially with climate change coming and hitting the continent more than anywhere else?”\n\n*An earlier version of this post misstated the size of Hong Kong’s ivory market."],[8,"Egyptian angel investor offers tough love for start-ups","Khaled Ismail, Egyptian entrepreneur turned angel investor, appears to be the meanest of the three judges on Huna al Shabab (Here are the Youths), a television programme in which contestants compete for funding for their start-ups.\n\nHe asks one competitor if he has heard of Chinese ecommerce group Alibaba, and cuts short another who tries to argue that, even though there are similar ventures to his in the west, none exists in the Arab world. (It makes spectacles for blind people to help them recognise text and faces.)\n\n“I don’t mean to be mean,” says Mr Ismail, sitting in a trendy Cairo coffee shop that he uses as a lively office for KIAngel, his one-man angel investment company. “Telling someone to their face with brutal honesty that something will fail is actually helping them. Anyone who does not think global is doomed to die.”\n\nThe entrepreneur, who is much gentler in real life than his on-screen persona suggests, is an example of the success that young Egyptians seek. In March 2011, with Egypt still engulfed in the chaos that followed its January revolution, Intel acquired SySDSoft, his Cairo-based software company, and hired about 100 of its engineers and computer scientists.\n\nFounded in 2002 as a provider of wireless and communication technology to global clients, the company had grown by the time it was sold “to become the number one in the world” in its particular niche of design for 4G, Mr Ismail says.\n\nThough he will not disclose how much Intel paid, Mr Ismail describes it as “a good sum”, which made some of the staff millionaires. More importantly for him, the sale gave company engineers the standing to start filling top positions in multinationals, proving “that Egyptian engineering is a global asset we should capitalise on”.\n\nIn a country where tech entrepreneurship is in its infancy, Mr Ismail, who holds a PhD in engineering from MIT, is unusual. Not only has he built a business based on innovation and sold it to one of the biggest names in the field, but since then he has also devoted himself to helping Egyptian start-ups through seed capital from KIAngel.\n\nThe aim, he says, is not to make a profit — any money he earns from an exit is reinvested in other start-ups — but to promote entrepreneurship in ways that make a difference to new companies, through the provision of capital, advice and connections.\n\nThe field is still small, with “the same 10,000 people” talking to each other and turning up to tech events. But he is a firm believer in the sector’s potential to lift Egyptians out of poverty.\n\nHe says he had initially intended to give a chunk of money from the sale of SySDSoft to charity. But he decided traditional philanthropy was less effective than promoting business, which expands the middle class and allows it to become an employer.\n\nThere is a “wrong mindset”, he argues, that thinks of the poor as the problem in Egypt; rather, the problem is the absence of a middle class.\n\nAlmost 30 per cent of Egyptians live below the poverty line, according to government figures, but millions also hover just above it, making them vulnerable to price shocks. According to the World Bank, 40 per cent of Egyptian youths are not in education, employment or training, presenting a challenge to the government in terms of both job creation and political stability.\n\nRecent years have brought initiatives to support start-ups and the launch of accelerators and incubators from the private sector, universities and the government. But the sector is embryonic, and bureaucratic rules that shackle businesses make the environment especially difficult for new ventures already suffering from scarce funding.\n\nLaunching a business in Egypt and obtaining funding and the necessary permissions is often difficult and time-consuming. Mr Ismail argues that if the government made registering and winding down a business as easy as filling in an online form, the number of start-ups would increase tenfold.\n\nSince 2012, KIAngel has invested $1.4m in 13 companies, of which three failed; Mr Ismail exited another three that “were going well but won’t grow much faster or much bigger, so I took the money to put somewhere else”. So far, he says, the average initial ticket has been between E£300,000 ($16,600) and E£2m, and the fund is willing to invest in follow-up rounds.\n\nMr Ismail, who usually buys stakes of between 5 per cent and 40 per cent, has invested in companies across a range of sectors.\n\nThey include Iqraaly, an app providing audio books, news and articles; Fustany, an online Arab fashion magazine; Fel Khedma, which provides household services such as carpentry, plumbing and electrical repairs; Recyclobekia, which acquires old electronic gadgets such as discarded mobile phones and mines them for precious metals; and Biodiesel Misr, which collects used cooking oil from food factories and exports it to Europe, where it is turned into fuel.\n\nHe says he does not involve himself in the day-to-day running of the companies, but makes himself available for support and advice. “I am very involved in financing when they want to raise money again,” he says.\n\nMany start-ups around the world, he argues, fail to take sufficient note of opportunity and timing, so he makes sure his companies do.\n\nAs for the future, he says: “I have no ambition to make more money. I don’t want to buy a boat or a jet. My hope is that one day there would be 100 successful companies who would say, ‘Khaled helped us.’”"],[8,"John Baizley: Losing Pete Adams, finding Gina Gleason, and Baroness' new album","Earlier this month it was announced that Baroness guitarist Peter Adams had parted ways with the band. Having been a part of the Savannah sludgelords for nine years and three albums, it came as something of a shock to the metal community. Playing his last show at the John Baizley-curated Roadburn in April, Pete said he decided to step away from Baroness in order to focus on his home life. Enter Gina Gleason. The six-stringed demon has spent her life touring and working with some of the coolest names in rock – Jello Biafra, Doctor Know, Perry Farrell – as well as a long stint working with Cirque du Soleil. Not a bad CV, right? To find out how Gina was recruited into the ranks of Baroness and the circumstances surrounding Peter's sudden departure, we caught up with frontman and sole remaining founding member John Baizley. He gives a few hints about the new album, too!\n\nWhat are the circumstances surrounding Pete's departure? \"I think it’s important to note that being a touring musician, and being in a band that puts as much effort into the process of touring and writing and rehearsing as we do, it should be noted that it’s not particularly easy if you desire a life at home. If your social life is important, if your personal and private life is important, this lifestyle as a musician can be a great strain. And we’ve had several members for who that strain was exerted in such a way that they did not want it to have a negative effect on their life. So Pete, having been in this band a long time, having been a friend of mine for decades, rather than finding himself in a position where he couldn’t put all of himself and 100 per cent into what it takes to remain in this band, I think he thought that in order to pursue his own interests, a friendly exit from the band would be much better than what could become a dramatic thing. It was really impressive to me, the way that the four of us were able to do this, and for him to leave the band on good terms and with full communication, because it’s so much easier to fuck off and leave. The fact we didn’t do that means a lot to me. I would never want to lose a friend because of this band.\"\n\nWho started the conversation? \"He did. We’re all adults, so nobody internally wants to force anybody out. Nobody would be a part of the band if there was that element. This was a decision that he made and talked to us about, and fortunately he was able to leave in a way where we weren’t left high and dry. He decided to leave, and we still had chosen to do this. So he fulfilled his obligations of doing those things, with that 100 per cent involvement. So that when he played his last show, which was at Roadburn last month, it was a good, uplifting and positive experience. Nobody knew that – we kept it very close to the chest. But that was part of it. So he got to leave on very good terms, and with a proper last show. And simultaneously, that allowed us to have time to adjust and find a new guitar player so we were able to continue forward without a huge lag.\" How long do you think he’d been feeling that way for? \"I don’t know, it’s hard to say, because everybody goes up and down on tour. We all have tours that are more of a strain on us, and are not as seemingly fun. You have to learn when that’s just part of the balance of your year, and then when it’s becoming a threat to you personally. I know Pete well enough to know he’s going to voice his opinion when it’s genuine, so I think he did. It didn’t seem like he strung us along, and I don’t think he felt like he was a member of a band too long after he had made that decision personally.\"\n\nWhat was Pete’s role been in the band – how involved was he in songwriting? \"Everyone in the band contributes, so it was never ever the case that he was a sidelined player. Everybody helps write, everybody helps do everything. Clearly there’s a workload differential, it’s impossible to deny that. But we wouldn’t have continued as a band if we didn’t feel like altering that chord of the band would somehow fundamentally change our sound. I was in this band in 2003, I’ve sort of seen it through, and it’s always been really important to me that our other members understand that that’s part of their role – is actually to understand what we’re about. And the way that we write, and the way that we play, and the way that we record is something that sometimes takes a little adjusting. \"What we can’t do is have somebody come in the band without learning a bit about our background. I guess it’s a roundabout way of saying everybody’s critically important when it comes to all of this. I would never hire somebody to show up and record a record and hire them to tour with us while in the background I’m writing everything. But that said, neither is it the case where without his compositional input, we’re incapable of moving forward. I think we’ve found a worthy new guitar player who is going to be fully capable of adding compositionally. And it will be different, but not different by a margin that’s going to change our band, in a negative way.\" How did you feel when he told you he wanted to move on? \"It’s complex, right? Because we have a very longstanding personal relationship, we have a very longstanding professional relationship, we’ve written a lot of music and we’ve gone on a lot of adventures together. So in that regard I think it was heartbreaking for me and it was heartbreaking for him. But because I knew his motivations, and I knew he had something he’d chosen to pursue once his decision was made, I was happy for him. As the singer, or the guy who’s been in the band the longest, it would be fully heartbreaking for me to think that somebody was in this band and didn’t wanna be, and that they felt some undue pressure to appease the other three members, or just to do it for the sake of making a living or something like that. We’ve got to put more into our music than that. So it is complicated. Of course I’m sad to see him go, but I’m also happy to hear he’s got a direction now and focus now that he didn’t have before. So yeah… I guess that’s why it’s complicated.\"\n\nYou have a new guitarist, Gina Gleason. Why Gina? \"She’s a great player, she’s got an incredible attitude, and she works super hard. And if that’s the case, why not? Being a member of this band is difficult, because it requires a kind of very particular set of circumstances. You have to be a great technical player, but you have to be an emotive player at the same time. There has to be this understanding of finding the balance between that technical playing and just playing hard – which oftentimes means looseness. So it became very clear to me that she could strike that balance. Before she was in the band, when we were just jamming, I sensed the natural chemistry that I have to sense for someone to be in the band. We have to be able to communicate non-verbally. I don’t know how to bark orders at people, nor would I want to if I could. There has to be some level of intuitive response. And so she had that in spades. Most importantly, she’s just a good person. Somebody could check all those other boxes, and if they’re a complete clown or a complete shithead, no fucking way. Because I’ve gotta live with you, we’ve gotta write music, we’ve gotta record, we have to move forward in life, and each step forward we take has to be a positive one. We’re doing things that we consider important, and things that we consider challenging, and challenges that we would like to put out there in the world. So if you’ve got some negativity, it’s going to become markedly different and probably impossible for accomplish the ambitions and goals I have within Baroness.\" What’s your connection with Gina? \"I have a small fuzz pedal company. We just make little stomp boxes for people, and she was one of the first people that bought one. And I noticed on the shipping receipt that she lived two miles from me. I don’t live in a hip neighbourhood, it’s not a place where a lot of people live, it was completely shocking to see that one of these was getting shipped down the road. So one of my partners checked out her Instagram profile, and was like John, you have to see her Instagram. That sounds super lame, but it was so obvious that she was such a talented player. You could kind of see as much as you can, and hear that there was an attitude there that was great, that was enthusiastic and creative and really had this… you could hear it in her playing. She had this real desire to grow. I just hit her up casually, and we started jamming, and that attitude I sensed just seeing her Instagram profile was more prevalent in the rehearsal space than I was anticipating. So it was natural. If it’s natural, and it works, and things seem great, then you just go with it. Because that’s not the majority of life. It’s not the majority of relationships you make. If something feels effortless and you know you’ve got some big work ahead to do, then you should go with that. And that’s in lieu of maybe finding somebody who had a bit more similarity in their history or who had a more developed public profile. I thought the interesting thing about her, and everybody that’s been in the band, is that they come to it with really a fresh attitude, and a huge desire not only to immerse themselves in what we’ve already established, but to push that forward. So, it feels great.\"\n\nHow far along with the next record are you? \"We started work on it, and I think there’s been a long enough time period in between our last record being released and now, that we are just dying to get new songs out. Every time any one of the four of us sits down, 20 ideas spill out. So this is a period of full flower for us. That’s another thing – when that’s happening, just grab it by the reins and let it pull you. Because if not, then you’re in this unfortunate position where you’re forcing things. And forcing things becomes repetitious, finding patterns that work and systems of organisation that yields predictable results is not what we want to do. We started playing music because we wanted to develop our own rulebook, and change those rules and adapt those rules and evolve and grow when we needed to. So that’s happening now. I can’t say that we’ve got a ton of songs finished, anything ready to hear, but we’ve got so much material to start with, it’s exciting to think about starting to rein this in and make an album out of it.\" \"It’s hard to say, I mean there’s so much stuff. I think with Purple we had a very clear idea about what we wanted to do. There was a real focus, because prior to that our bass player and drummer had left, and what we felt happening in rehearsal was that our music was very amped-up, very focused, very direct. That meant that there were certain ideas that have always been part of the Baroness sound that we just… maybe… brushed them aside for the time being. Now I think it’s time to pull some of those elements back in and find some news places to go. Because we’ve been making music for a while; we don’t want to repeat ourselves. We want to keep our sound intact, but we want to develop new ideas that will yield new results and add to our sound, rather than change it.\"\n\nWhat kind of things would you be talking about, for your new sound? \"Sometimes really subtle, theoretic things. New compositional structures, and chord voicings – boring stuff that excites nobody except musicians. But the idea that we can continually open up the level of communication that’s inherent within our music is more subtle and nuanced, but also more bold and genuine, and that we continually put our spotlight on things that are theoretically from a lyrical standpoint maybe difficult. Maybe things that were hard to say five years ago, because there was an emotional weight keeping them from coming out. I’ve found in recent years that the more purely I address that stuff, the better I feel about songwriting. The more our audience seems to respond to it. One thing I’ve learned is that the things that we keep real tight, these emotions and experiences that we don’t want to talk about openly, the more we do address these things, the more we realise our audience has all felt similar things, and because of that, we’re all tied to one another more strongly. So I think that’s something we wanna do. But then it’s like okay, we’ll make the soft songs soft, the hard songs harder, the fast songs faster, the slow songs slower, stuff like that.\" What colour is it going to be? \"We’ll see. We haven’t made up our minds. That’s very specific, and we have not made any decisions on that, as of yet. I don’t want it to be a colour, but, you know, we’ve still got one left...\""],[8,"Adam West Dead: 'Batman' Star Was 88","Adam West, the ardent actor who managed to keep his tongue in cheek while wearing the iconic cowl of the Caped Crusader on the classic 1960s series Batman, has died. He was 88.\n\nWest, who was at the pinnacle of pop culture after Batman debuted in January 1966, only to see his career fall victim to typecasting after the ABC show flamed out, died Friday night in Los Angeles after a short battle with leukemia, a family spokesperson said.\n\nWest died peacefully surrounded by his family and is survived by his wife, Marcelle, six children, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n\n\"Our dad always saw himself as The Bright Knight and aspired to make a positive impact on his fans' lives. He was and always will be our hero,\" his family said in a statement.\n\nAfter struggling for years without a steady job, the good-natured actor reached a new level of fame when he accepted an offer to voice the mayor of Quahog — named Adam West; how's that for a coincidence! — on Seth MacFarlane's long-running Fox animated hit Family Guy.\n\nOn the big screen, West played a wealthy Main Line husband who meets an early end in Paul Newman's The Young Philadelphians (1959), was one of the first two humans on the Red Planet in Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964) and contributed his velvety voice to the animated Redux Riding Hood (1997), which received an Oscar nomination for best short film.\n\nRaised on a ranch outside Walla Walla, Washington, West caught the attention of Batman producer William Dozier when he played Captain Quik, a James Bond-type character with a sailor's cap, in commercials for Nestle's Quik.\n\nWest, who had appeared in many Warner Bros. television series as a studio contract player, was filming the spaghetti Western The Relentless Four (1965) in Europe at the time. He returned to the States to meet with Dozier, \"read the pilot script and knew after 20 pages that it was the kind of comedy I wanted to do,\" he said in a 2006 interview with the Archive of American Television.\n\nHe signed a contract on the spot, asking only that he be given the chance to approve who would play his sidekick, Robin, the Boy Wonder. (He would OK the casting of Burt Ward, who had a brown belt in karate but zero acting experience.)\n\n\"The tone of our first show, by Lorenzo Semple Jr., was one of absurdity and tongue in cheek to the point that I found it irresistible,\" West said. \"I think they recognized that in me from what they'd seen me do before. I understood the material and brought something to it.\n\n\"You can't play Batman in a serious, square-jawed, straight-ahead way without giving the audience the sense that there's something behind that mask waiting to get out, that he's a little crazed, he's strange.\"\n\nThe hunky Lyle Waggoner (later of The Carol Burnett Show) and Peter Deyell also tested to play the Gotham City crime fighters, but West and Ward clearly were superior, and Batman debuted at 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 12, 1966, a Wednesday.\n\nThe cliffhanger episode would be resolved the very next night — Same Bat-time! Same Bat-channel! The show was originally intended to last an hour, but ABC split it up when it had two time slots available on its primetime schedule.\n\nWest said that he played Batman \"for laughs, but in order to do [that], one had to never think it was funny. You just had to pull on that cowl and believe that no one would recognize you.\"\n\nThe series, filmed in eye-popping bright colors in an era of black-and-white and featuring a revolving set of villains like the Riddler (Frank Gorshin), Joker (Cesar Romero), Penguin (Burgess Meredith) and Catwoman (Julie Newmar), was an immediate hit; the Thursday installment was No. 5 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1965-66 season, and the Wednesday edition was No. 10.\n\n\"Stellar, exemplar, a king to the end,\" Newmar said of West in a statement: \"He was bright, witty and fun to work with. I will miss him in the physical world and savor him always in the world of imagination and creativity. He meant so much to people.\"\n\nBatmanwas nominated for the Emmy Award for outstanding comedy series in its first year, losing out to CBS' The Dick Van Dyke Show. A 20th Century Fox movie was rushed into production and played in theaters in the summer before season two kicked off in September 1966.\n\nHowever, the popularity of the show soon plummeted, and Batman — despite the addition of Yvonne Craig as Batgirl — was canceled in March 1968 after its third season.\n\nWest quickly struggled to find work, forced to make appearances in his cape and cowl at car shows and carnivals and in such obscure films as The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker (1971), written by Semple, and The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood (1980). He and his family downsized, leaving their home in the tony Pacific Palisades for Ketchum, Idaho.\n\n\"The people who were hiring, the people who were running the studios, running the shows, were dinosaurs,\" the actor said in the 2013 documentary Starring Adam West. \"They thought Batman was a big accident, that there was no real creative thought, expertise or art behind it. They were wrong.\"\n\nWest returned to voice his iconic character in such cartoons as The New Adventures of Batman, Legends of the Superheroes, SuperFriends: The Legendary Super Powers Show and The Simpsons, and Warner Bros.' long-awaited DVD release of ABC's Batman in 2014 brought him back into the Bat Signal's spotlight.\n\nHe was born William West Anderson in Seattle on Sept. 19, 1928, the second of two sons. His father, Otto, was a wheat farmer; his mother, Audrey, was a pianist and opera singer.\n\nWest attended an all-boys high school, then graduated with a major in English literature from Whitman College. During his senior year, he worked for a local radio station, doing everything from Sunday morning religion shows to the news.\n\nHe also starred in a couple of plays at the local theater. \"I found that I could move an audience and I was appreciated,\" he said.\n\nIn the Army, West served as an announcer on American Forces Network television, then worked as the station manager at Stanford while he was a graduate student.\n\nHe got a job at a McClatchy station in Sacramento, California, then moved to Hawaii, where he hosted a two-hour weekday show in the late 1950s with a diaper-wearing chimp named Peaches. (West said he once interviewed William Holden as the actor was passing through.)\n\nWest got a contract at Warner Bros. at $150 a week and was placed in one of the studio's TV series — Colt .45, Maverick, Hawaiian Eye, 77 Sunset Strip, Cheyenne, etc. — pretty much every week.\n\nHe got his first regular TV role when he played Det. Sgt. Steve Nelson under the command of Robert Taylor on the 1959-62 ABC/NBC series The Detectives, coming aboard when that show expanded to one hour in color.\n\nAfter he split with Warner Bros., West showed up in such forgettable films as Geronimo (1962) starring Chuck Connors, Tammy and the Doctor (1963) with Sandra Dee and in The Three Stooges film The Outlaws Is Coming (1965) before Batman changed his life forever.\n\nHe later starred in a rejected 1991 NBC pilot episode called Lookwell — written by Conan O'Brien and Robert Smigel — in which he portrayed a once-famous TV detective who thinks he can solve crimes in real life.\n\nThen came the gig on MacFarlane's Family Guy.\n\n\"I had done a pilot with Seth that he had written for me. It turned out we had the same kind of comic sensibilities and got along well,\" he said in a 2012 interview. \"When Family Guy came around and Seth became brilliantly successful, he decided to call me and see what I was doing. He asked if I would like to come aboard as the mayor, and I thought it would be neat to do something sort of absurd and fun.\"\n\nStarring Adam West culminates with him receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2012.\n\nHe married Marcelle in 1970; they met when she was the wife of the Lear Jet founder and they posed for a publicity photo at Santa Monica Airport, with him in his Batman costume. (They each had two children from their previous marriages, then added a couple of their own.)\n\nIn a tribute to West, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and LAPD chief Charlie Beck at 9 p.m. on Thursday will light a Bat-signal that will be projected onto the tower of Los Angeles City Hall at Spring Street. Donations in West's name can be made to to the Adam West Memorial Fund for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital or to the Idaho-based charity for children diagnosed with cancer and their families, Camp Rainbow Gold.\n\nWhen Batman was canceled, \"The only thing I thought is that it would be the end of me, and it was for a bit,\" West told an audience at Comic-Con in 2014. \"But then I realized that what we created in the show … we created this zany, lovable world.\n\n\"I look around and I see the adults — I see you grew up with me, and you believe in the adventure. I never believed this would happen, that I would be up here with illustrious people like yourselves. I'm so grateful! I'm the luckiest actor in the world, folks, to have you still hanging around.\""],[8,"David Miliband and the International Rescue Committee Are Working to Save Refugees","Somewhere along the path that led David Miliband to become head of policy under U.K. prime minister Tony Blair at the age of 29 and foreign secretary under Gordon Brown at 41, Miliband acquired the nickname the Brain. And, sure enough, seconds after we're introduced, the slim 50-year-old asks with Cumberbatchian rapidity whether I'm \"Ernest in town and Jack in the country.\" I'm lucky to catch the reference: I'd chanced on the Colin Firth–Rupert Everett movie version of The Importance of Being Earnest on cable just days before. But the tone has been set: We will be moving quickly.\n\nMiliband needs that speed and acuity in his new job, as the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee. The NGO, founded in 1933 with the help of Albert Einstein, manages more than $675 million a year in grants, a sum that allowed it to offer assistance to some 18 million people last year. Now the vast enterprise faces the greatest crisis in the sector since the Second World War. \"With 20 million refugees and 40 million internally displaced, it's a world record,\" Miliband says. \"It's an issue that's literally lapping up on Europe's shores.\"\n\nSince he began the job, in 2013, the IRC has had to move rapidly onto \"war footing\" in response to the civil war in Syria and the rise of ISIS—all while maintaining equally critical operations in places like Nigeria, South Sudan, and Pakistan. And then came the November 13, 2015, attacks in Paris, and the increasing evidence, at press time, that at least one of the terrorists had passed through Greece as a Syrian refugee.\n\nFor some, in the aftermath of that tragedy, compassion for the people the IRC is struggling to help was obliterated. But Miliband has little patience for the isolationists both here and abroad competing to close their borders against the waves of refugees. \"Political leadership from those in or aspiring to public office should involve educating public opinion, not inflaming it,\" he says.\n\nMiliband came into the job knowing that \"some of the most challenging public policy issues fall at the intersection of humanitarian intervention and foreign policy,\" something the former chief diplomat was well equipped to handle.\n\nBut he also saw an opportunity to set new standards. \"The humanitarian sector was founded for dealing with refugees in refugee camps,\" he says. \"And today most refugees are not in camps; they're in urban areas.\" He quickly enumerates other antiquated notions: that refugees live in countries that abide by the Geneva Conventions (they don't); that their displacement is of short duration, when on average they're forced to live outside their native countries for 20 years.\n\n\"The assumption underpinning the sector is that we do social intervention that tides people over until they can rebuild their lives,\" he says. \"It's increasingly evident that we need an economic dimension as well as a social dimension.\"\n\nAs you might expect from a policy expert, no sooner has Miliband outlined the problem than he suggests a possible well-documented solution. \"What we are doing,\" Miliband says, \"is setting a very clear benchmark that overall the sector needs to dedicate more resources to things that are proven. So, for example, cash distribution is shown to be an extremely effective means of helping those who are displaced and of helping their host communities.\"\n\nSo the IRC gave reloadable debit cards to many Syrian refugees in Lebanon, providing up to $200 a month in cash. And the group has found that every dollar it distributed has had a multiplier effect, generating $2.13 in Lebanese GDP. \"You're immediately breaking down resentments that might exist between host communities and refugees,\" he says. \"And you're empowering people to spend money on what they need. They might not need another tent or another fleece or another blanket. So you're honoring the integrity and the agency of the individuals you're serving.\"\n\nWhen I bring up the refugee policies of his current country of residence—Miliband now lives in New York City, not too far from the IRC's headquarters—the erstwhile diplomat wastes no time being diplomatic. \"With respect to the Syrian issue, America, I'm afraid, gets a D. So far 1,854 Syrians have been allowed into the U.S. since the war began, despite the fact that there are successful Syrian-American communities here. And these are communities where, in the name of family reunification— if you're willing to redefine family reunification as being about cousins and not just sons and daughters—you could give people a great chance of making a new life for themselves. Because they would be part of a community when they arrived.\"\n\nBut what of the fears of inadequate assessment of Syrian asylum seekers? Miliband points out that refugees—vetted by multiple government agencies, from the Department of Homeland Security to the FBI to the Department of Defense—are already the most thoroughly screened population in the U.S. \"We cannot take everyone,\" he says. \"But Europe and the U.S. have been beacons of hope for centuries. Refugee resettlement is actually a U.S. success story—this is no time to close it down.\"\n\nBelow, watch David Miliband discuss the global refugee crisis at theTown & CountryPhilanthropy Summit."],[8,"Why we must oppose a government held up by the DUP – DPAC","Join the protests:\n\nProtest: May Must Go – No Coalition of Chaos and Hatred – Saturday 17 June, 2-4pm, Whitehall, London, Called by Owen Jones. https://www.facebook.com/events/290268031384019\n\nProtest the Queen’s speech – no to May/DUP racism & bigotry! – Monday 19 June, 6pm–8pm, Parliament Square, London, SW1P.

Assemble 12pm, Saturday 1 July 2017. BBC Broadcasting House, Portland Place, London W1A 1AA. March to Parliament Square\n\nWhile certain disability charities are trying to hook up with the new government, Disabled People Against Cuts is calling on Deaf and Disabled people and their organisations to boycott engagement with any government involving the DUP. Collusion with an anti-equalities party who openly oppose women’s right to choose and gay marriage while denying climate change is nothing less than shameful. Disabled people must be united in resisting the politics of hate.\n\nImmediately after the election, Disability Rights UK released a statement offering to work with the new government. This bizarre move smacks of an organisation so out of touch that it called the wrong outcome and is now at sea with how to respond. Their “offer” is a desperate attempt to retain influence that not only stands in contempt of the years of suffering Disabled people have endured under the Tories but also disregards the harm and division that any form of alliance with the DUP represents.\n\nThe Tories are in chaos and cannot credibly remain in government. Now is the best chance since 2010 to end a government that has carried out a regime of conscious cruelty against Disabled people and systematically and deliberately dismantled our rights. We stand on the bring of social change built from the aspirations of the many not the few. Labour has made firm commitments to the issues that Deaf and Disabled people have been fighting to achieve for years such as enshrining our rights under the CPRD in domestic legislation, working with Disabled people to develop a national system of social care, and scrapping out-sourced benefit assessments.\n\nInstead of helping build the grassroots movement for social justice that has shaken the political establishment in the UK to its core, DR UK would rather get in bed with the Tories and their anti-equalities partners. The demands they now apparently want to work with a hard right wing government on implementing are the same ones they failed to support when they were demanded by Disabled people on the streets and pledged by parties on the left.\n\nDRUK’s position rests on a false notion that disability rights exist in a bubble that floats above Party politics and left and right ideological divisions. This is utter nonsense. The ideological division between left and right is based on a real difference in interests over whether society is better run when in the interests of the many (from which flows a belief in the importance of rights and equalities) or to secure profits for the few. At a time of economic prosperity governments can afford to make concessions in order to reduce opposition, but in a period of economic decline inequality grows as the many are made to shoulder the cost of the crisis.\n\nInequality has grown sharply since the last financial crash in 2008 and as a result of the austerity measures imposed as the response by Tory led governments since 2010. While still suffering under those impacts the economic outlook for the UK continues to weaken: as economist Michael Roberts notes in his post election analysis, “In the first quarter of 2017, the UK’s real GDP grew more slowly than any other top (G7) economy”. These are not the economic conditions under which governments make concessions. They are the conditions under which they step up attempts to scapegoat and divide.\n\nBring in the DUP. A party with a track record of specialism in the politics of hatred and violence. In 1977 founding member Ian Paisley launched a political campaign to prevent the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland called “Save Ulster from Sodomy”. In 2008, DUP MP Iris Robinson stated in Parliament that homosexuality is “viler” than child abuse and the party today continues to oppose equal marriage which is still not legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nMeanwhile the 1967 Abortion Act, which established legal abortion, has never applied in Northern Ireland. The law is far stricter and even pregnancy as a result of rape is not a circumstance in which an abortion can be performed legally. The High Court recently ruled that this was incompatible with the human rights of women, but the law can only be changed by legislators. Already an ex-Tory minister has hinted there could be a Commons vote on increasing abortion limits as his party looks to cement its alliance with the DUP.\n\nThese issues are not irrelevant to Disabled people who are not only Disabled but also Black, gay and women. We do not stand in isolation from our communities but rather fight against cuts that segregate and separate us.\n\nThe DUP’s position on welfare will also be familiar to those who followed the sustained attempt by other parties to block the welfare reform bill in Northern Ireland, despite fines from Westminster of £9.5m per month for non-implementation. Due to devolution of powers, this could only be introduced by passage through the Northern Ireland Assembly in Stormont. With a population that experiences greater levels of mental health issues, campaigners were concerned about the impacts welfare reform observed in areas of the UK where cuts had already been rolled out.\n\nThe Department for Social Development which oversees benefits in the North admitted that a full 25% of people currently receiving DLA would not receive anything under PIP while a further 33% would receive a reduced award. Nevertheless, DUP social development minister Mervyn Storey put a legislative consent motion to MLAs (members of the Northern Ireland Assembly) which was voted through, transferring power over welfare reform from Stormont to the Tory government in Westminster and paving the way for cuts.\n\nAnother DUP MP, Gregory Campbell, made a name for himself claiming that rising levels of DLA claims were due to fraud and pointing specifically to numbers receiving the “taxpayer-funded hand-out” in West Belfast. He claimed that “it would appear from these figures that there are people in some areas who are able to claim DLA long after you would assume they were no longer entitled to it” drawing a distinction from what he called “legitimate claimants”.\n\nAs the BBC, in its newest role as DUP apologist, keeps pointing out, DUP demands on the Tories include that the introduction of means testing for Winter Fuel Allowance, pledged in the Conservative manifesto, will not apply in Northern Ireland, as well as extra capital spending and more cash from the UK Treasury for Northern Ireland’s schools and hospitals. We shouldn’t let this fool us into seeing the DUP as a party with social principles. Had they really cared about the impact of cuts, they could have mitigated the effects with the funds that were instead ploughed in to paying businesses to heat empty properties in the “cash for ash” scandal.\n\nDisabled People Against Cuts have led a bitter fight against the Tory cuts for 7 years, our #TrashTheTories campaign helped deliver a serious blow to the Conservatives at the general election. We can’t let this attempt by Theresa May to cling on and do more damage by trading away our rights to secure a deal with the vile bigots of the DUP go unchallenged."],[8,"How Putin Seduced Oliver Stone — and Trump","In Episode 2, responding to a question about the state of democracy in Russia, Mr. Putin claims that Russia has “hundreds of television companies” that the state could not control if it tried. This is untrue but goes unchallenged.\n\nIn Episode 3, Mr. Putin tells a long and winding story about the origins of the war in Ukraine, culminating in the claim that the war began after nationalist Ukrainian Special Forces kidnapped ethnic Russians from eastern Ukraine. Mr. Stone appears to accept these fantastical claims.\n\nCondition No. 2: A love of power and grandeur. Episode 2 is the story of a courtship, of sorts. Mr. Putin shows Mr. Stone his horse stables (intercut with stills of Mr. Putin riding). Then the two men watch a movie together. Then Mr. Stone watches Mr. Putin play hockey and fawns, praising Mr. Putin’s athletic prowess and vitality.\n\nThen Mr. Stone brings up the thorny subject of L.G.B.T. rights, which Mr. Putin takes as an opportunity to assert both his desirability and his homophobia: He says that he would not enter a shower stall with a gay man because he wouldn’t want to tempt him, and because he is a master of judo. In other words, the hypothetical gay man would find Mr. Putin irresistible, and Mr. Putin would have to beat him up. Both Mr. Putin and Mr. Stone seem to find this scenario entertaining.\n\nIn Episode 3, Mr. Putin shows Mr. Stone his home in Sochi. Mr. Stone is duly impressed. Then they go to the Kremlin. “This is a pretty big place you’ve got here,” Mr. Stone enthuses. “Can you show me around?”\n\nMr. Putin obliges, taking Mr. Stone to an office where a monitor is broadcasting — perhaps on a loop — Mr. Putin’s famous 2007 speech denouncing NATO and the West, and to another office, where the Russian president keeps a portrait of his father as a young sailor in Crimea. At the conclusion of the episode, Mr. Stone recites to Mr. Putin the Russian president’s own speech about the annexation of Crimea. Mr. Stone seems to enjoy having Mr. Putin’s words in his mouth. Mr. Putin is clearly pleased to hear his own speech, albeit in English.\n\nCondition No. 3: Shared prejudice. Mr. Stone and Mr. Putin are both terrified of Muslims. This shared view facilitates much of their conversation. In Episode 1, Mr. Stone informed Mr. Putin that William J. Casey, who led the C.I.A. in the 1980s, had a project “to excite the Muslims in the Caucasus in Central Asia.” (Mr. Stone is apparently unaware that the Caucasus and Central Asia are two different regions, hundreds of miles apart.)\n\nIn Episode 2, Mr. Stone offers his sympathy to Mr. Putin: “You mentioned earlier, the white, the ethnic Russian population is diminishing,” he says, apparently believing that Russia was, consequently, in danger. But Mr. Putin has good news: “Fortunately, we have reversed this situation. For three years running, we have had population growth, including in regions that are historically majority ethnic-Russian.” Mr. Putin practically appears to be the savior of the white race.\n\nCondition No. 4: An inability or an unwillingness to distinguish fact from fiction. Throughout the interviews, Mr. Stone appears to ask Mr. Putin prearranged questions, probably written by the Russian president’s staff. Such scripted questions are standard fare for Mr. Putin’s annual news conference with Russian journalists.\n\nIn Episode 1, for example, Mr. Stone, after fumbling through a set of inaccurate biographical queries, suddenly asks Mr. Putin about assassination attempts against him. There had been more plots against Mr. Putin, says Mr. Stone, than against Fidel Castro. “There is a legitimate five I’ve heard about,” he says confidently. This is remarkable, because journalists who have covered Mr. Putin — including me — have not heard of five, four or even one attempt to assassinate the Russian president (though Russian law enforcement has claimed to have foiled a plot or two). But Mr. Putin is not at all surprised at the question and proceeds to answer it confidently.\n\nIt should not be surprising that Mr. Stone is willing to play the Kremlin’s game. Throughout the “Interviews,” he uses footage from feature films — World War II movies and even Mr. Stone’s own drama “Snowden” — as though they were documentaries.\n\nCondition No. 5: Moral neutrality. To exercise ignorance, racist prejudice, a love of power and total disregard for factual accuracy, one has to inhabit a world where everything can mean anything and nothing is certain.\n\nA quote from Episode 4 illustrates how this approach works: “Stalin was a product of his time,” Mr. Putin says. “You can demonize him all you want, or, on the other hand, talk about his contributions to victory over Nazism. But the excessive demonization of Stalin is just one way to attack the Soviet Union and Russia, to suggest that today’s Russia carries the birthmarks of Stalinism. Everyone has one kind of birthmark or another. So what?”\n\nSo what, that is, if Russia increasingly idolizes the man who killed millions of Soviet citizens and confined tens of millions to concentration camps? So nothing, apparently. “Your father, your mother, admired him, right?” Mr. Stone says. “Of course,” Mr. Putin says.\n\nOf course, Oliver Stone is not Donald Trump. But he shares with him a certain way of seeing the world and being in the world — and the luxury of persisting in this way of being, and even making a spectacle of it."],[8,"More Than 1.1 Million Sign Petition Supporting Impeachment of Trump","AMY GOODMAN: John Bonifaz is also with us, Free Speech for People. John, you came on Democracy Now! like within a week of the inauguration, calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump. How have things changed? You focused on violations of the Emoluments Clause at the time. Explain what your concern was with that. And is that still what you feel is grounds for impeachment?\n\nJOHN BONIFAZ: Amy, thank you for having me. I’m honored to be on with Congressman Green and with you this morning.\n\nWe have launched this campaign with RootsAction on the day of the inauguration at ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.org. More than 1 million people all across the country have called for this impeachment investigation in light of the president’s direct and ongoing violations of the anticorruption clauses of the Constitution. His refusal to divest fully from his business interests placed him on a collision course with the Constitution from the day he took the oath of office. But we have since expanded the grounds for our call for an impeachment investigation to include obstruction of justice, in light of the shocking revelations that the president fired the FBI director to try to stop a criminal investigation that may incriminate him as well as other associates in his campaign.\n\nCongressman Green is an American hero. He’s standing up for our Constitution and our democracy at this critical moment in our history. And we’re urging people all across the country to join us at ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.org, to stand with him and to make sure that this president be held accountable via the impeachment process.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So how does this move forward right now, John Bonifaz?\n\nJOHN BONIFAZ: I think it’s incumbent upon all of us all around the nation who believe in our Constitution and the rule of law and democracy, that no one, not even the president of the United States, is above the law, that we stand up, that we stand with Congressman Green, that we call on our members of Congress to join him in making this call to issue an impeachment resolution and start the process in the United States House of Representatives.\n\nI know there are people who are saying, “Well, we need to get the facts out.” And we do need to get the facts out. But as Congressman Green has eloquently stated, we need—we already have these facts. They’re talking about getting other facts. The facts are out on obstruction of justice. The facts are out on the violations of the anticorruption clauses of the Constitution.\n\nAnd we’re dealing right now with a constitutional crisis, in which this president is openly defying the rule of law in our Constitution. So, people all across the country need to stand up. Nine communities, including the Los Angeles City Council, have already passed resolutions calling on Congress to take this action. Brookline Town Meeting in Brookline, Massachusetts, is going to vote this Thursday on this question. And many other communities in the weeks ahead will do that, as well. And people can go to our site at ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.org. They can download a local resolution and have it passed in your community. Hold an impeachment town hall, as Congressman Green did this past Saturday, and get your community talking about this critical question of our time. This is about our Constitution. It’s about our democracy. And we all need to stand up.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Congressman Al Green, have Republicans come to you in support, any of your—any of the Republican congressmembers?\n\nREP. AL GREEN: Well, I’ve had Republicans to say to me that they oppose these ugly things that have been said. I have not had any Republicans to tell me about the resolution that I’m proposing or the impeachment effort. And that’s because I have not asked. I have intentionally not approached colleagues on this issue. This is a question of conscience for me. And I hope that my colleagues will approach it as I have, but I will not ask anyone to do this. I’m not lobbying anyone. I have concluded that this has to be done, and my hope is that others will see things similarly. But if they do not, I will understand. I think the people of the United States of America, as John has indicated, have to get involved. It’s a participatory democracy. If the people will advance their will, the will of Congress will be advanced.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The Hill has reported that Congressmember Justin Amash of Michigan, Republican, admitted Trump may have committed an impeachable offense if he asked FBI Director James Comey to drop the FBI’s investigation into Flynn. Amash is at least the second Republican openly to say Trump may have committed an impeachable offense. Also Republican Congressman Carlos Curbelo did, from Florida, said this on CNN last week. Your thoughts on this, Al Green?\n\nREP. AL GREEN: Well, thank you, Amy. I think a good many people see the obstruction of justice, and a good many people understand that obstruction of justice is impeachment. I think it’s beneficial that three members of the Republican Party have given these indications. But I also understand that there are a good many members who will be silent until given the opportunity to vote. And at that point, they will voice their opinions. My hope is that they will have heard from enough of their constituents, so that they better understand the will of the people. I think the will of the people will prevail. It’s just a matter of making sure people understand what the issues are.\n\nAnd finally, this, on this question of others, I believe that others who desire to speak up will have the opportunity to do so as more things come out, as there’s more evidence presented. I think that we haven’t seen the last of this evidence that is ultimately going to be presented. But I also know that we already have enough to impeach, because of the firing and because the president confessed on national television that he did it because of the investigation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, Texas Congressmember Al Green, John Bonifaz of Free Speech for People, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nREP. AL GREEN: Thank you.\n\nJOHN BONIFAZ: Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We’ll continue to follow your actions on the floor of the House, Congressman Green, and this whole impeachment movement around the country.\n\nThis is Democracy Now! When we come back, we’ll go to London to speak with Tariq Ali about the suicide attack at the Manchester arena. Stay with us."],[8,"Ruth Davidson reveals shock climbdown on the Tories’ hardline opposition to free NHS prescriptions – The Scottish Sun","The party chief sparked ridicule after previously arguing the flagship SNP policy was causing patients to die\n\nRUTH Davidson has revealed a shock U-turn on the Tories’ hardline opposition to free NHS prescriptions.\n\nThe party chief sparked ridicule as she confirmed the switch despite previously arguing the flagship SNP policy was causing patients to die.\n\nTories, who have opposed free medicine since 2007 and backed an £8 fee last year, unveiled the new stance as part of their Westminster General Election campaign — even although the NHS is devolved to Holyrood.\n\nQuizzed if the turnaround was simply opportunism, Ms Davidson said: “Part of a job in a representative democracy is to make decisions that are right for the country, but that also represent the will of the people of the country.\n\n“And we know that there is a large amount of support for this policy and we recognise it.”\n\nConservatives have argued against the £1.3billion annual policy since Alex Salmond’s manifesto pledge ten years ago, and were the only party who fought to reverse the total abolition of fees in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, the year after she became Scots party leader, Ms Davidson, below, warned it meant cash was being diverted from other areas, including vital cancer drugs.\n\nShe said: “People in Scotland are actively paying with their lives for this policy.”\n\nA source close to Ms Davidson admitted the reversal was partly “political”.\n\nBut Tories said the switch was down to health spokesman MSP Donald Cameron, who was elected last year.\n\nHe said experts were reviewing charges and suggested fees could be introduced for cheap medicines including paracetamol and aspirin, which cost NHS Scotland £13.4million a year.\n\nHe added: “There is no doubt that people value the idea of free prescriptions.\n\n“We have listened to them and changed our policy. But this has to be assessed thoughtfully.”\n\nLabour’s Anas Sarwar last night accused Ms Davidson of a “humiliating shift” in a desperate hunt for votes.\n\nHe said: “Ruth Davidson has shown once again she will do and say anything to try and get elected but even now won’t fully commit to ensuring everyone has access to the medicine they need.”\n\nAnd former First Minister Mr Salmond, SNP candidate for Gordon said: “Ruth Davidson used to describe free prescriptions as a ‘publicly-funded bribe’ – but this shows even the Tories recognise the SNP pursues the right policies for Scotland.\n\n“While the Tories preside over a humanitarian crisis in the NHS in England, Scotland has the best performing health service in the UK.\n\n“If the Tories want to ditch their nasty party image, they should be U-turning on their indefensible, cruel policies the bedroom tax, the rape clause, cuts to housing benefits and the graduate tax.” chris.musson@the-sun.co.uk\n\nWe pay for your stories and videos!

Both look like solid new cameras — the 6D especially, since it’s been anticipated for even longer than it’s been rumored. But they’re both still missing one of the most requested features: 4K video.\n\nThe $1,999 6D Mark II is a follow-up to 2012’s Canon 6D, a slightly cheaper and slightly less capable full-frame sibling to Canon’s popular 5D series. It’s been a long wait, but judging from the specs, that wait might be worth it when the 6D Mark II goes on sale in July.\n\nJust about everything has been upgraded from the first 6D to the second, as you’d probably expect. It has a new 26.2-megapixel CMOS sensor, and uses some of the company’s most advanced internals, like the DIGIC 7 image processor. The high end of the native ISO range gets bumped up to 40,000 from 32,000, which is nice, because the original 6D was already a low light marvel.\n\nThe 6D Mark II also uses Canon’s ultra-fast Dual Pixel autofocusing system, and the camera now has 45 cross-type autofocus points at its disposal, a step up from the 6D’s paltry 11. It shoots at relatively fast pace of 6.5 frames per second, but there’s a short runway there: the maximum burst is 21 frames for RAW photos, and 150 for JPEGs.\n\nCanon’s made the 3-inch LCD on the back a touchscreen, and the panel swivels out to the side now, too. But the 6D Mark II is also weather resistant, on par with the sealing found on the more expensive 5D Mark IV, according to Canon. Inside, you’ll find Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth, and GPS radios. And Canon’s done all this while only adding a few grams to the original weight of the 6D. In other words, it’s a fully modern digital SLR camera — something the relatively ancient 6D hasn’t been in years.\n\nThe $549 Rebel SL2 is also a substantial improvement to a popular Canon camera that was announced years ago. It has a 24.2-megapixel CMOS sensor, and it also uses the DIGIC 7 and Dual Pixel AF. The SL2 gains a swivel touchscreen, as well as Wi-Fi, NFC, and Bluetooth.\n\nIf you’re interested in using the 6D Mark II or the Rebel SL2 for video, though, know that they both top out at 1080p at 60 frames per second. There’s no 4K video here.\n\nWhen Canon announced last summer that the 5D Mark IV would shoot 4K, it seemed like the company was finally acquiescing to the demands of its most advanced users. But every new Canon DSLR since then has had a maximum video resolution of 1080p. Same goes for the company’s fledgling mirrorless cameras.\n\nMany people, arguably most people, don’t need to shoot in 4K. Canon knows that, and that’s why the company repeatedly eschews adding it to new cameras. But 4K is quickly becoming a more normal part of our video-consumption habits. 4K playback is built into YouTube, we have 4K televisions, and we’re knocking on the door of 4K phones. The point is you’re eventually going to have a 4K screen, and the majority of Canon’s DSLRs can’t shoot video that will properly fill it.\n\nEven if the video you’re shooting isn’t going to wind up displaying in 4K, there are creative benefits to shooting at such high resolutions. A popular example is that you can use that extra space to crop in tighter on a particular shot without ruining the resulting quality, since there’s four times the amount resolution compared to a 1080p frame, and most video is still output at 1080p.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I asked Canon during the briefing for these cameras if they were worried that skipping 4K again would scare off creators who crave it. Here was the company rep’s response:\n\nYou know 4K’s one of those things that, um... it is a conversation. And just on cameras like this, when it comes to image processing and all that, it’s just uh, how can I phrase this? Like the 5D IV, it’s a very heavy format, it’s a very large file, and from people we’re talking to, they want 4K but they’re scaling down to 1080, so 4K is a very hard resolution for them to work with currently. So it’s kind of a catch 22 right now.\n\nThe company has been this evasive about 4K for a while now. But the overall message is clear: if you want to shoot 4K video with a Canon DSLR, you have to buy one of the company’s most expensive cameras. And it’s not entirely clear when that will change.\n\nCanon hasn’t stopped innovating with its camera tech. Dual Pixel is a genuine breakthrough with respect to the autofocus on the company’s cameras, and the DIGIC image processors produce some of the best pictures (and video) around. But to survive in an increasingly turbulent camera market, Canon has also put an inordinate amount of focus on building cameras that plug gaps in its existing marketing strategy instead of ones that are ahead of the curve.\n\nThe 77D is the perfect example of this. Canon took the internals of the cheaper T7i and repackaged them in a more robust body that resembles the more expensive Canon 80D. You can argue that there’s value in that move. (After all, it’s also working for Nikon.) There are probably people who are just fine shooting with the T7i’s limited capabilities but would like a sturdier packaging, who also don’t want to spend quite so much for the 80D.\n\nBut at this rate, Canon’s going to hunt these margins into extinction. And by that point, customers who are hungry for more advanced features will have turned their attention elsewhere.\n\nYou’ll be able to buy the 6D Mark II and SL2 in all of their 1080p glory starting next month."],[8,"The health cost of cutting free school lunches will be far greater than the price of them","The Conservative Party’s manifesto pledge to replace free school lunches – for children in the first three years of primary school in England – with free breakfasts is curious to say the least.\n\nSince it was announced, researchers have found that the cost of the project is hugely undervalued. In an official statement launched before the manifesto, the party said that breakfast clubs “will cost £60m a year”. It has since been found that this would be the equivalent of less than 7p per pupil.\n\nFurther analysis by think tank Education Datalab has found that if only half of pupils take up the free breakfast at a more realistic cost of 25p – though even this would only amount to porridge with milk – it could cost more than £400m when extra staffing costs are added in.\n\nBefore the financial disparity was highlighted, questions quickly arose over whether a free school breakfast for all children could be better than a free school lunch for some.\n\nReports warned that almost a million children from poor backgrounds could lose out under the new policy. And it could potentially cost families £440 for each child affected every year.\n\nNot all children can, or want to, attend the breakfast clubs, however. Former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who was a champion of the policy when it was rolled out in 2014, has warned that “the offer of free breakfasts won’t reach the children who don’t come to breakfast clubs”.\n\nQuestionable research\n\nThough the Conservatives have issued statements saying that breakfasts are “at least as effective as lunch”, the data that they are relying on is simply not enough.\n\nThe manifesto pledge is backed by the findings of a pilot study: the Magic Breakfast Project. Year two and year six students in 106 English schools were allocated to receive free breakfast every day during the 2014-2015 academic year in the context of a breakfast club. There was also a control group, for whom breakfast was not provided.\n\nThe childrens’ academic achievement was measured by assessing Key Stages one and two assessments in maths and English, along with teachers’ feedback on class behaviour and concentration. The breakfasts were found to be successful in increasing the academic achievement of year two students and helping them to get two months ahead of their peers. Teachers also reported improved behaviour and concentration.\n\nBut there are a few problems here. While the Key Stage assessments might provide some unbiased information, behaviour and concentration was only assessed by teachers, who were likely to know whether the student attended the breakfast club. With most other literature reporting the positive effects of breakfast on students, this observation could well have been biased.\n\nEducational benefit\n\nIn a very recent review of the academic research on the impact of dietary intake on school performance, it was found that most studies have looked at the effects of breakfast consumption on academic performance.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that breakfast aids academic achievement in school-aged children better than lunch. It means that there is more evidence from (mainly cross-sectional) breakfast studies.\n\nIdeally, to compare the two, there would need to be randomised control trials with direct comparisons between different types of meal and educational outcomes – at present there are none.\n\nAcademic achievement is an important criterion, but it shouldn’t be the only one on which we measure the success of a school provision. For many children, their free school lunch may be the only hot meal they have in a day. It may also be the only opportunity they have to eat a nutritious meal, including vegetables to support the development of healthy eating habits, and protein to support physical development.\n\nIn short, lunchtime is one more lesson on healthy eating and on what a healthy meal should look like.\n\nAlthough Theresa May pledged to keep free school lunches for the poorer students, the criteria that will be set are unclear and, considering a lot of poor students were left out before the provision, this is concerning.\n\nBut regardless of financial background, healthy eating is something every student should learn. This is about educating children to hopefully make healthier choices throughout their lives.\n\nSocial skills\n\nThe Magic Breakfast Project makes another very important point that was overlooked in the manifesto: it is not just eating breakfast that delivers improvements, but attending a breakfast club.\n\nIt might be the experience of communal eating itself, a time spent with their peers interacting in a non-academic environment, that explains the findings. Considering the Conservative Party is quoting only 25 per cent of children attend breakfast clubs at present, a large proportion of students might miss the opportunity of the free meal and this experience of communal eating. On the contrary, school lunches are attended by all students, providing an equal opportunity to all.\n\nThere is not, at present, enough convincing evidence to switch from free school lunches for some children to free breakfasts for all. The financial costs alone are a cause for concern, but the ramifications it could have on teaching children to lead healthy lives are too great to ignore.\n\nSophia Komninou is a lecturer in infant and child public health at Swansea University.

Where a prodigal Labour party would run the economy into the ground with excess spending, they say they’re prepared to take the ‘common-sense’ approach of austerity. Raoul Martinez argues that this story doesn’t ring true; austerity is a recipe for economic misery.\n\nOn 17 October 2010, British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne told the nation it had been ‘on the brink of bankruptcy’. Four days later he revealed his rescue plan: £80 billion of government cuts. No country had ever volunteered such extreme austerity. The claim that there was an urgent need for deep cuts was part of a growing political consensus held together by a simple story: Britain was in an ‘economic mess’ thanks to the previous Labour government’s overspending and the economic priority had to be elimination of the deﬁcit and reduction of the debt. Government spending on everything from unemployment beneﬁt to disability living allowance would need to be slashed. It was going to be painful, but collective sacriﬁces had to be made.\n\nThough the story had the virtue of simplicity, it was wrong on every count. According to Cameron and Osborne, bringing the debt – the total amount of money owed as a result of government borrowing – under control was ‘the most urgent task’ facing the Coalition. However, most economists disagreed and some had published a letter in TheGuardianto provide some perspective: “History shows, ﬁrst, that British public debt is not high by the standards of the last 200 years. It is rather low in comparison to the second half of the 18th century, the ﬁrst three- quarters of the 19th century, and most of the inter-war and post-Second World War era in the 20th century. It is also low in the context of the developed world.” In 2010, the national debt was 57 per cent of GDP, lower than Italy, France, Germany, Japan, and the US. At the end of the Second World War – when the British government created the National Health Service, the welfare state, national pensions, a motorway network and council housing – government debt stood at 238 per cent of GDP. In other words, when Osborne became Chancellor, public debt was not a pressing issue.\n\nThen there’s the deﬁcit – the difference between the amount a government spends and the amount it raises through taxes. The Coalition’s austerity narrative blamed the rising deﬁcit on Labour’s spending, but much of the rise could be explained by the global recession itself, not the unremarkable spending of the previous government. An economic downturn automatically increases dependency on social beneﬁts and reduces tax revenue because people lose their jobs, wages drop and less tax is collected, all of which naturally increases the budget deﬁcit. The recession was a global phenomenon, far beyond the control of the Labour government. Despite this fact, a banking crisis that had its origins in the irresponsible and illegal behaviour of the private sector was repackaged as a crisis of government ﬁnance.\n\nWhen the Coalition came to power, neither history nor mainstream economic theory provided any support for the claim that cuts were the only way to reduce the deﬁcit. Cutting spending in a recession has been tried many times and – without exception – failed. For instance, in the aftermath of the First World War, the US, Britain, Sweden, Germany, Japan and France all adopted austerity policies with devastating impacts on their economies. President Herbert Hoover’s austerity response to the 1929 economic crash was followed by the Great Depression.\n\nThe historical failure of austerity as a response to economic crises resulted in a widespread consensus among academic economists that, since recessions are caused by a reduction in demand (and when there is no room to offset cuts by reducing interest rates), cutting spending only makes the situation worse. The textbook response to economic downturns, as any student of the subject knows, is to increase spending. By spending more in the short term, a government can reduce public debt faster because smart spending creates jobs, increases tax revenues and releases more people more quickly from dependency on the state.\n\nHowever, as governments began to embrace austerity, a handful of economists produced research telling them exactly what they wanted to hear. It was seized on by politicians and journalists alike to justify the unorthodox remedy. This research was ultimately discredited: questionable assumptions, dubious procedures and outright mistakes were exposed. As time passed, what little academic support for austerity existed, fell away. At the start of the Coalition’s time in power, twenty prominent economists sent a letter to theSunday Timesurging Osborne to eliminate the budget deﬁcit over the next ﬁve years. The letter was gratefully acknowledged by the Chancellor. Two years later, as the UK suffered a double-dip recession and Osborne was forced to borrow billions more than he had planned, the same group were asked if they stood by their initial advice. Only one out of the original twenty said they did: many were now in favour of ending austerity and increasing public spending.\n\nBy 2013, the economies of countries that had imposed severe spending cuts were experiencing slower growth than those that had increased their spending. The IMF, though it had recommended austerity in 2010, in effect conceded it had made a mistake by underestimating the damage of cutting government spending in a weak economy. Its own ﬁgures showed that austerity consistently undermined growth. Economist Paul Krugman observed that ‘since the global turn to austerity in 2010, every country that introduced signiﬁcant austerity has seen its economy suffer, with the depth of the suffering closely related to the harshness of the austerity’. According to Simon Wren-Lewis, Professor of Economic Policy at Oxford University, the cost of austerity in delaying the UK economic recovery is about £100 billion. He points out that “If any other government department had wasted that amount, there would be a huge outcry from the media . . . [which] continues to misrepresent economic ideas even though it has access to academic expertise.” A government campaigning for re-election with that kind of performance, he continues, “should be trying to avoid talking about its economic record at all costs”. In fact, the opposite was the case. In the lead-up to the 2015 election, David Cameron boasted that austerity had rescued the economy and created jobs. This was a deception that only 15 per cent of economists agreed with. Simon Wren-Lewis explains why:\n\nTo see how absurd this claim is, imagine that a government on a whim decided to close down half the economy for a year. That would be a crazy thing to do, and with only half as much produced, everyone would be much poorer. However, a year later when that half of the economy started up again, economic growth would be around 100 per cent. The government could claim that this miraculous recovery vindicated its decision to close half the economy down the previous year. That would be absurd, but it is a pretty good analogy to claiming that the recovery of 2013 vindicated the austerity of 2010.\n\nIn fact, the recovery only began once austerity policies were relaxed two years into the Coalition’s term. The original plan had been to eliminate the deﬁcit in the ﬁrst ﬁve years, but by 2012 – with no hint of a recovery, lower tax revenues than expected, and waning academic support – Osborne quietly backtracked. From then on, there was much less deﬁcit reduction. The predictable result was that in 2013 the economy began to improve, three years later than it should have done. Of course, the recovery did not beneﬁt everyone equally: real wages had fallen by 10 per cent, while top earners increased their share of the wealth. The majority of new jobs created were low-paid, lacked security and left people without enough paid hours. In 2015, inﬂation-adjusted GDP per capita was still lower than it had been before the crisis. On top of this, overall government debt had soared. In his ﬁrst budget, Osborne claimed to have ‘set the course for a balanced budget and falling national debt by the end of this Parliament’. Yet his economic plan had increased the national debt by 80 per cent in just ﬁve years. In fact, Osborne borrowed more in ﬁve years than his predecessor did during a whole decade.\n\nEven if we accept that reducing the government deﬁcit was an immediate priority, there was more than one way to do it. Osborne opted for a strategy that harmed the most vulnerable, creating a cost-of-living crisis in the world’s seventh richest country. He forced a million people to rely on food banks, stripped disabled people of essential ﬁnancial support and cut beneﬁts to the low-paid and unemployed. Many people have died because of these policies. One study looked at the impact of the newly introduced Work Capability Assessment, designed to reassess the eligibility of disabled people for out-of-work beneﬁts with the stated aim of getting more people ‘back to work’ so as to reduce the welfare bill. This programme, which declared many sick and severely disabled people ‘ﬁt for work’, was associated with a signiﬁcant increase in suicides, mental health problems and the prescription of anti-depressant drugs. In 2011, Mervyn King, then Governor of the Bank of England, summed the situation up when he said ‘The price of this ﬁnancial crisis is being borne by people who absolutely did not cause it’ and ‘I’m surprised that the degree of public anger has not been greater than it has.’\n\nThe deﬁcit could have been reduced by placing the burden on the wealthiest instead of the poorest. Rather than cuts to public services, the British government could have raised taxes on the wealthiest individuals and corporations; introduced a ﬁnancial transaction tax (the so-called Robin Hood tax); eliminated tax loopholes that beneﬁt the top earners; and ensured that corporations paid the full value for using national resources. ‘These revenue raisers would not only make for a more efﬁcient economy’ writes Joseph Stiglitz, they would ‘substantially reduce the deﬁcit [and] also inequality.’ But the rich did not bear the burden of reducing the deﬁcit. Instead, the Conservatives cut the top rate of tax – a policy so unpopular that even the majority of their own voters were against it.\n\nIf austerity is bad economics, why did business leaders and politicians support it? The simple answer is ideology. It is an article of faith for neoliberals that the state must shrink, welfare and social security must be cut, and everything from healthcare to prisons must be privatised. The focus on deﬁcit reduction provided a convenient cover to lay waste to the welfare state. Speaking candidly at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet in 2013, David Cameron revealed that spending cuts were ultimately about ‘building a leaner, more efﬁcient state . . . Not just now, but permanently.’ In addition, the austerity narrative also heightens the political bargaining power of business. As Krugman puts it, ‘Business leaders love the idea that the health of the economy depends on conﬁdence, which in turn – or so they argue – requires making them happy.’\n\nAs soon as the ﬁnancial crisis hit, the case against austerity was overwhelming. Given that the most vulnerable people in society were set to be punished for the failings of the ﬁnancial sector, a free media in a functioning democracy would have torn the government’s austerity fairytale to shreds. This didn’t happen. In response to the Coalition’s plan, theFinancial Timesclaimed ‘There are alternatives to UK austerity, just not good ones.’ Instead of challenging the need for cuts in the lead-up to the government’s Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2010, the BBC, Sky and ITV asked their viewers and listeners where they should fall.The Daily Telegraphcelebrated George Osborne’s budget, calling it ‘fair and progressive’, one of ‘authority and intelligence’.\n\nIn interviews with government ministers, the assumption that cuts were needed went unchallenged. The BBC’s John Humphrys prefaced a question to the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg with ‘We know you need to make cuts, but . . .’. On BBC TV, Andrew Marr conceded to George Osborne ‘You clearly need to make the savings, the cuts . . .’. On Channel 4 News, Jon Snow grilled Labour leader Ed Miliband after he left out a section in his speech on the deﬁcit, asking ‘How could you not mention paying off this appalling deﬁcit? Surely it is the most important issue of all. It is the essence of our economic crisis.’\n\nOn 1 April 2015, the Centre for Macroeconomics at University College London had just published a survey showing that the vast majority of economists disagreed that austerity had boosted growth or employment. On the same dayThe Daily Telegraphemblazoned its front page with a letter from a hundred businessmen expressing their enthusiastic support for austerity. Although a survey conducted by theFinancial Timesfound that less than 20 per cent of economists believed that the beginnings of a recovery in 2013 were due to austerity measures, it still declared in September that: ‘Osborne wins the battle on austerity’ – a claim repeated across the media.\n\nResearch by Julien Mercille at University College Dublin examined the coverage of austerity after the 2010 election, looking at four leading national papers –The Daily Telegraph,The Times, theFinancial Timesand TheGuardian. Mercille found a clear pro-austerity bias (TheGuardianbeing the exception). Of 347 articles, only 21 per cent showed any opposition to austerity. When TheGuardianis removed from the sample, the ﬁgure drops to 13 per cent. Another way of demonstrating press bias is to examine which ‘experts’ were invited to comment on the cuts. Almost all of them were bankers, economists and politicians. Only 1 per cent came from a trade union.\n\nThe preference for establishment sources is the norm. Cardiff University lecturer Mike Berry conducted a study into the impartiality of the BBC and found that ‘across all programming, business representatives received substantially more airtime on BBC network news . . . than they did on either ITV . . . or Channel 4 News’. On the BBC’s News at Six, the year the crisis hit, business representatives outnumbered labour union representatives by more than ﬁve to one. This ratio rose to nineteen to one in 2012. Another study focused on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme for the six weeks following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The study found that the expert sources invited on were ‘almost completely dominated by stockbrokers, investment bankers, hedge fund managers and other City voices’. Thus the sector that had created the crisis ‘were given almost monopoly status to frame the debate’ to the complete exclusion of voices questioning the legitimacy, scale and value of the ﬁnancial sector.\n\nOf course, there were notable exceptions across the media. A number of high-proﬁle journalists and economists did their best to voice opposition to Osborne’s cuts. But a look at public opinion over the period shows how inﬂuential the austerity narrative had become. In June 2009, a poll byThe Daily Telegraphfound that three-quarters of voters believed the cuts were necessary. Initially, there was some opposition to the way cuts were being made but, according to the YouGov polls tracking public opinion, this opposition steadily declined over the next few years. As this decline occurred, the proportion of people who believed the cuts were ‘too slow’, doubled. The most popular cuts were often those that targeted the most vulnerable: the disabled, the unemployed and those receiving housing beneﬁt. By 2014, an ICM poll showed that the public, by a wide margin, trusted the Conservatives more – the party of austerity – ‘to manage the economy properly’.\n\nThroughout this period, immigrants, criminals and welfare claimants were offered up by much of the press as scapegoats upon whom the public were invited to heap blame for the failing economy. An Ipsos MORI 2013 survey for the Royal Statistical Society and King’s College London compared public opinion on issues such as beneﬁt fraud, crime and immigration. The public believed 24 per cent of welfare was claimed fraudulently – the actual ﬁgure is 0.7 per cent. Almost a third of respondents believed that more welfare goes to the unemployed than to pensioners. The reality is that ﬁfteen times more is spent on pensions. The majority believed that crime was rising – in fact, the ﬁgures show it had dropped signiﬁcantly. A majority thought that 31 per cent of the population were recent immigrants; the actual ﬁgure is 13 per cent. In each case, public perceptions mirrored the carefully constructed media narrative that deﬂected criticism from the Coalition’s failing experiment with austerity.\n\nThroughout the Coalition’s time in government, the Labour Party did not oppose austerity. Under the leadership of Ed Miliband, Labour was committed to ‘austerity-lite’: cuts were needed, they claimed, but not quite as many or quite as fast as the Tories were planning. After losing the 2015 election, Miliband resigned, and the only anti-austerity candidate on the ballot, outsider Jeremy Corbyn, surged to victory on a wave of popular support, earning the largest mandate ever won by a party leader. The media onslaught that followed was remarkable. As subsequent research has shown, the British press ‘systematically undermined’ Corbyn ‘with a barrage of overwhelmingly negative coverage’. Analysing nearly 500 pieces across eight national newspapers, the Media Reform Coalition found that, in Corbyn’s ﬁrst week as leader, for every positive article there were more than four times as many that were openly hostile or expressed animosity or ridicule. News articles, which are meant to be more balanced, demonstrated more bias than comment pieces or editorials, with 61 per cent judged to be negative. The ‘impartial’ BBC mirrored this pattern. When asked if he was ‘shocked’ at the way the BBC ‘rubbish Jeremy Corbyn’, former BBC political editor Nick Robinson – one-time president of the Oxford University Conservative Association – replied ‘Yes’ and said that he had written to colleagues expressing his grievances.\n\nThe experience of austerity in the UK has been relatively mild compared to nations like Portugal, Spain and, worst of all, Greece. They have suffered particularly badly under the austerity fever that swept the eurozone after the ﬁnancial crash. But not every country took the path of swingeing spending cuts. As the austerity narrative ampliﬁed across Europe, Iceland showed that another way was possible. It is an interesting story that has been largely ignored by the press. An effective media would have drawn on this test case to challenge the prevailing narrative.\n\nAccording toThe Economist, ‘Iceland’s banking collapse is the biggest, relative to the size of an economy, that any country has ever suffered.’ Its ﬁnancial industry imploded, the stock market fell by 90 per cent, and investments worth many times the output of the nation were wiped out in a single week. Desperate for money, the government turned to the IMF for $2.1 billion in loans. The loans came with conditions: the government would have to slash public spending and use half its income to repay investors who had lost money on their private investments. In effect, Iceland’s taxpayers were being asked to foot the bill for the bad investment decisions of its banking elite.\n\nOn the back of riots and protests, the Icelandic president granted the people a referendum. Nine out of ten voters said ‘no’ to paying off bankers’ debts and instead demanded increased investment in their fragile economy. Taking this on board, the government rejected the IMF conditions, allowed its banks to default, imposed urgent capital controls and raised spending on public welfare. Universal education and healthcare were protected, social security was strengthened for those most in need, and many people had their mortgage debts written off. As for the bankers, the worst offenders were prosecuted and sent to prison. In other words, Iceland ignored every principle in the ﬁnancial industry’s rulebook.\n\nThe stock markets reacted negatively to the vote, and Iceland was widely condemned. Yet, by 2012, this tiny country was outperforming the US and many European nations with an economy growing by 3 per cent a year and with unemployment levels falling below 5 per cent. Iceland went further and adopted a new crowd-sourced national constitution to safeguard its future. By 2015, even the IMF had to admit that Iceland had achieved economic recovery ‘without compromising its welfare model’. In fact, it became the ﬁrst crisis-struck European nation to top its pre-crisis peak of economic output and is close to repaying many of the debts it owed to other nations. In response to the question, ‘What is the reason for Iceland’s recovery?’, President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson famously answered: ‘We were wise enough not to follow the traditional prevailing orthodoxies of the Western ﬁnancial world in the last 30 years. We introduced currency controls, we let the banks fail, we provided support for the poor, and we didn’t introduce austerity measures like you’re seeing in Europe.’\n\nRaoul Martinez is a philosopher and documentarian.

But the Qataris, who dismiss most of the claims, say the coalition is instead scheming for regional hegemony.\n\n“The Saudis regard the Qataris as a village that got out of control and Abu Dhabi regards them as a rival,” said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst at Brookings Institution.\n\nMr Tillerson cancelled a trip to Cancún this week to focus on Qatar and has undertaken a flurry of calls and meetings with his Gulf counterparts.\n\n“We hope the list of demands will soon be presented to Qatar and will be reasonable and actionable,” Mr Tillerson said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that he understood the list had been prepared.\n\n“I think these countries misled the US and they undermined president [Donald] Trump’s initiative by doing so,” said Meshal bin Hamad al-Thani, Qatar’s ambassador to the US, of Mr Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia last month, at which he called for a united regional response to terrorism. “We are convinced this is nothing to do with fighting terrorism; they want to undermine our sovereignty,” he said.\n\nBut in a blow to lobbying efforts by Qatar, the state department said the US would not seek to broker joint talks with the estranged parties in Washington, saying it was unnecessary “at this point”.\n\n“I don’t think that will happen,” said a senior Arab official of the prospect for Washington-based mediation. “I believe everyone agrees this is an Arab problem that requires an Arab solution.”\n\nThe UAE said last week a list of specific complaints would be handed over “soon”, adding it was consulting all four leaders of the coalition against Qatar — which also includes Bahrain and Egypt. But it has also said it wants commitment from Qatar that it will change course first.\n\nQatar has said it is prepared to make concessions if the countries present evidence alongside their claims, which include accusing Qatar of promoting biased media coverage and “meddling” in their affairs.\n\nAndrew Bowen at the American Enterprise Institute said the Saudis were more willing to compromise than the UAE on Qatar, adding Riyadh would probably be the one to solve the crisis.\n\n“Abu Dhabi and Doha are in a competition for pre-eminence and their visions fundamentally clash,” said Mr Bowen. Qatar preferred to harness populist Islamist movements as a route to stability, while the UAE backed a secular approach that did not have to be democratic, he added. Both countries, like Saudi Arabia, are run by family dynasties and are concerned about the prospect of potential popular dissent.\n\nDov Zakheim, a former top Pentagon official, said the US faced conflicting objectives over Qatar.\n\n“On the one hand it wants to do all it can to combat terrorism and resist Iran. That argues for a tough stance against Qatar. On the other hand it would rather not have to relocate al-Udeid [air base], which is do-able but time-consuming, inefficient and perhaps costly,” said Mr Zakheim.\n\nOfficials say Qatar has tried to leverage its air base, which hosts 11,000 US troops, as insurance for its US relationship.\n\n“The base is Qatar’s ace in the hole,” said Mr Riedel, citing the $12bn sale of US fighter jets to Qatar last week in the midst of the schism. “Since 2003 it’s been the most important base for US military operations from Syria to Afghanistan,” he said. “If the US had to move, it would be expensive and disruptive.”\n\nFollow @KatrinaManson and @Dimi on Twitter"],[8,"Ricky gives robotic surgery 'Royle' seal of approval","The campaign has been launched by Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Charity to establish the UK’s first robotic heart and lung surgery programme.  \n\nThe new robotics programme will enable more patients requiring specialist cardiothoracic treatment to benefit from cutting edge surgery.\n\nHeart disease kills someone every six minutes and it’s estimated that more than 12 million people are living with some form of lung disease.\n\nLiverpool Heart and Chest Hospital – the first specialist Trust in the country to be rated outstanding by the Care Quality Commission – is at the forefront of the battle against these two leading causes of death in the UK. \n\nAs one of the largest specialist hospitals in the country, it serves a population of 2.8 million people, spanning Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales and the Isle of Man, and sees more than 100,000 patients each year.\n\nIts new fundraising campaign '10,000 Tenners' will help towards the cost of the new £2 million surgical robot, enabling more patients requiring specialist cardiothoracic treatment to benefit from this state-of-the-art surgery. The new robot will also ensure even better treatment for patients, with reduced pain following surgery, quicker recoveries and faster return back home to loved ones and normal activities. \n\nCommenting on the ’10,000 Tenners’ campaign, Ricky said: “10 years ago I was told I needed major heart surgery and I discovered for myself just how fantastic Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital is.\n\n“It’s an outstanding hospital which treats thousands of heart and chest patients, just like me. They gave me a second chance and that’s why I’m supporting their ‘10,000 Tenners’ campaign to bring robotic surgery to Liverpool.”\n\nMr Paul Modi, Consultant Cardiac Surgeon at the hospital, said:  “The benefits of this new programme for our patients will be enormous.\n\n“Whilst we are already a leading centre for minimally invasive surgical procedures, we are at the absolute limit of the numbers that we can help this way with our existing equipment.\n\n“With a robotic surgery programme, we will be able to significantly increase the number of patients who can undergo minimally invasive surgery.  Equally importantly, we will also be able to reduce their post-operative pain, lower their risk of infection, and ensure that their stay in hospital is considerably reduced, getting them back to their family and loved ones quicker, which is where they want to be.”\n\nHe added: “The new programme will also enable us to operate on those who are currently considered inoperable because of their health, as there is far less trauma to the body operating through small incisions only a few millimetres in length, rather than the more traditional open surgery.\n\n“This is especially important as we live in an ageing society and more people are living with a number of health problems. Robotic surgery can make a huge difference to their lives.”\n\nMr Mike Shackcloth, Consultant Thoracic Surgeon, added: “Our new robotic programme will not only allow us to provide even better care for our patients, but it will also enable us to develop a training and research programme that will ensure that  we can attract the top trainees and consultants in the future.\n\n“Our team at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital have national and international reputations for outstanding care and treatment, and our new robotics programme will ensure we remain at the leading edge of advances in surgery.”"],[8,"Rehousing of Grenfell Tower families in luxury block receives mixed response","While some residents welcome the families to Kensington Row others are less positive with concerns over future property prices\n\nTwo miles south of the charred skeleton of Grenfell Tower is a large complex of sleek new apartments that some of those displaced by last week’s inferno will soon be able to call home.\n\nKensington Row’s manicured lawns, clipped trees and burbling fountains are a haven from the rumbling traffic of two busy London thoroughfares, and its spacious, air-conditioned foyers a relief from June’s oppressive heatwave.\n\nFour unfinished blocks house the 68 flats purchased by the Corporation of London for families who lost their homes in Grenfell Tower. Workmen had been instructed not to talk to the media, but one said there was now a rush to complete the building work. “It’s a brilliant idea,” he said of the resettlement plan.\n\nAmong those exercising dogs and small children, the views were more mixed. “It’s so unfair,” said Maria, who was reading the news in the Evening Standard with two neighbours.\n\nShe bought her flat two years ago for a sum she was unwilling to disclose. “We paid a lot of money to live here, and we worked hard for it. Now these people are going to come along, and they won’t even be paying the service charge.”\n\nNick, who pays £2,500 a month rent for a one-bedroom flat in the complex, also expressed doubts about the plan. “Who are the real tenants of Grenfell Tower?” he asked. “It seems as though a lot of flats there were sublet. Now the people whose names are on the tenancies will get rehoused here, and then they’ll rent the flats out on the private market. And the people who were actually living unofficially in the tower at the time of the fire won’t get rehoused.\n\n“I’m very sad that people have lost their homes, but there are a lot of people here who have bought flats and will now see the values drop. It will degrade things. And it opens up a can of worms in the housing market.”\n\nAJ, who moved into his £2,500-per-month one bedroom flat less than two months ago, said he was neutral about the plan. “I’m Switzerland,” he announced while walking Enzo, his chow chow.\n\n“I love it here. There are great facilities – a pool, cinema, gym, spa. Porters are on duty 24 hours a day. It’s well built and well maintained. The other day I had a problem with the air conditioning and it was fixed in half an hour.”\n\nHe had been horrified at the fire. “It was dreadful, I had friends living there. We gave stuff, and went up and helped for a couple days last week. In my eyes everyone should be equal.”\n\nWaiting to collect children outside the Kensington primary academy, Jaime Paul thought the plan to rehouse Grenfell Tower residents in the complex was a good thing.\n\n“These flats are being wasted. There are so many empty ones,” she said. “People who are worried about the values of their homes are just being selfish.”\n\nIn the complex’s marketing suite, a smartly dressed saleswoman declined to give details about the announcement or the facilities available to residents. A concierge directed the Guardian to the complex manager, who insisted the flats where Grenfell Tower residents would be housed were under separate management, although built and owned by the same developers.\n\nEdmond, an Albanian worker who lays parquet floors in the apartments, said the Grenfell Tower rehousing plan would never come to pass. “It’s not going to happen, trust me. Go and have a look at the cars down there,” he said, gesturing at the underground car park as a black Jaguar with a personalised numberplate purred down the ramp to the remote-controlled gates.\n\n“You can write what you like, but trust me, money rules the world. People like me are going to live here? Never.”"],[8,"Arrest that comedian! How satire could swing the UK election","From disrupting dam-building to toppling dictators, comedy has shown itself to be a global force for good. Here’s what ‘laughtivism’ could do for British politics\n\nAt a protest to mark the inauguration of President Trump, film-maker Michael Moore volunteered an unusual rallying call. “Let’s form an army of comedy,” he cried. “Participate in the ridicule and the satire of the emperor who has no clothes. And we will bring him down.”\n\nUnlike almost every satirised ruler ever, the new US president reacts to jokes – usually peevishly, usually on Twitter. Since he came to office, there has been an open war between the Donald and the nation’s late-night political satirists: John Oliver, Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert. Responding to Trump’s daily scandals, this cohort of comics arguably form a more potent opposition than journalism and the Democratic party combined.\n\nBut where can this lead? Is it realistic to expect that comedy can bring about political change? In the UK, confidence in such an outcome is at a low ebb. Charlie Brooker lamented recently that “satire and mockery have changed nothing”; Mock the Week panellist Andy Parsons told audiences at his stage show that political humour has next to no effect.\n\nTheir low morale is understandable: the UK’s most prominent TV satirical formats, Have I Got News for You and Mock the Week, are respectively 27 and 12 years old, and feel cosy. Their supposed inheritors – Channel 4’s The 11 O’Clock Show and ITV’s The Nightly Show – tanked, though I have higher hopes for Frankie Boyle’s upcoming New World Order on the BBC. Who now expects satire to play an instrumental role in the UK election? Back in 2015, Russell Brand seemed to hold the result of the vote in his manicured hands, and look what happened there.\n\nBrand was a latecomer to political activism (and never a satirist per se) but his bolt to prominence demonstrates comedy’s potential as a tool of political change – and its limitations. Comedians have politically useful skills (self-projection, public speaking, the common touch) and they don’t take themselves too seriously – a tradeable commodity in today’s political marketplace, as Boris Johnson will tell you. But, as argued in the recent book Russell Brand: Comedy, Celebrity, Politics by Jane Arthurs and Ben Little, Brand was undermined by the trappings of his own celebrity – his wealth, his licentiousness, and the difficulty of squaring the radical posturings of his stage act with a viable programme for political change.\n\nBut Brand’s failure isn’t conclusive. There are plenty of examples of comedy making the world a better place. Most modern histories of satire begin with the political cartoonists of the 18th and 19th centuries: Gillray and Rowlandson in the UK; Thomas Nast in the States. The latter waged a one-man cartoon war against New York’s corrupt political establishment in the 1860s, presided over by Tammany Hall supremo William “Boss” Tweed. “Stop them damn pictures!” Tweed reportedly demanded – but the pictures prevailed, and Tweed was jailed.\n\nFast-forward a century, to proto-standup Lenny Bruce in the States and the birth of modern British satire with Beyond the Fringe and its off-shoots. Both shattered the prevailing culture of deference to authority, and the embargo on jokes about politicians and morality. “The show was designed as a revolutionary act,” said Christopher Booker, a writer on 60s TV satire That Was the Week That Was. And it had a revolutionary effect: without it, the sixties would surely have progressed with considerably less swing.\n\nThe next wave of UK satire crested with latex puppet show Spitting Image (1984-96). What positive change can such satires realistically hope to effect? They don’t take up a coherent political position: despite what the Daily Telegraph claims, they mock left and right equally. Certainly, the creators of Spitting Image made no claims for its revolutionary potential. “I don’t think, in retrospect, that it did make a difference,” says Roger Law.\n\nBut some disagreed – Judy, the wife of Liberal party leader David Steel, claimed that the show, which depicted her husband as David Owen’s pipsqueak pocket mascot in the Liberal SDP alliance, killed his political career. In that same period, Guardian cartoonist Steve Bell’s caricature of John Major – forever wearing his Y-fronts outside his trousers – surely contributed to the slow erosion of the then PM’s authority.\n\nIs that the best we can hope for from satire: that it’s one force among the many that together can initiate change? Certain jokes have played that role: George Carlin’s “seven dirty words” routine, in the 70s US battle for free speech; the “class sketch”, featuring John Cleese and the Two Ronnies, on BBC1’s The Frost Report, in the loosening of Britain’s class structure.\n\nAlexei Sayle was the frontman of the political “alternative comedy” of the early 1980s. “You can’t go into comedy with the intention of effecting change,” he says now. “That would be arrogant and self-defeating.” But if comedy can’t cure, he argues, it might prevent. “If a ruler is even mildly socially conscious, they may be afraid of being laughed at. So they may stop doing things in the first place that they know would open them up to mockery. Political comedy can have an effect,” he concludes, “if the ruling caste has a degree of shame.”\n\nBut when it comes to changing people’s minds, let alone how they vote, Sayle is more doubtful. “My stuff is obviously very leftwing, but I was never trying to persuade people. That wasn’t the purpose of it.” If anything, it was more of a “bonding exercise”, he says, with people who felt the same way.\n\nSayle’s caution is understandable: alternative comedy was born in 1981, and his hated Tories remained in power for a further 16 years. But elsewhere comedy has had a more immediate effect. Tina Fey’s impersonation of presidential running mate Sarah Palin was credited with sinking 2008 candidate John McCain’s hitherto buoyant bid for office. US comic Hannibal Buress’s 2014 joke about Bill Cosby shattered the silence around the Cosby rape allegations, creating the conditions for the senior comic’s indictment and imminent trial.\n\nAt other points, comic practitioners have acted as lightning rods – or sacrificial lambs – focusing opposition to troubling socio-political developments. Take French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, for example, and the Islamist threat in Europe. Or Jan Böhmermann, the comic sued by the German state in 2016, at Turkey’s prompting, for insulting the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nDid the world change after the Böhmermann affair? No. But his threatened prosecution threw into relief the moral squalor of Europe’s compromises with Erdoğan. The last few years have seen many comics reinvent themselves as politicians, with striking success. The Icelandic act Jón Gnarr bid for the mayorship of Reykjavik as a satirical gesture on his TV show; his victory, in 2010, wasn’t part of the plan. Guatemala has a comedian president (Jimmy Morales); Italy’s Five Star Movement was founded and is led by a satirist, Beppe Grillo, and has had a seismic impact on European politics; and Eddie Izzard – when not talking about monkeys up trees – promises a tilt at London’s mayorship.\n\nUntil then, the closest the UK has to a politician-comic is Mark Thomas. Thomas’s art and his politics are mutually reinforcing: as a joker/campaigner, he’s scored countless victories, the most memorable of which led to British contractors withdrawing from the construction of Turkey’s controversial Ilisu dam project in 2002. In the States, ex-Daily Show host Jon Stewart was credited with securing the passage of the so-called Zadroga Act guaranteeing free healthcare for 9/11 first responders. Stewart came out of semi-retirement in 2015 to make a series of appearances on late-night telly, campaigning for the bill.\n\nBut are these examples of comedy “changing things” – or of off-duty comedians doing so? For clearer cut examples of the revolutionary potential of comedy, you need to look further afield. To Egypt, where Bassem Youssef was arrested by President Morsi’s regime, and hounded out of the country after the coup by Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, because the jokes on his satire show Al Bernameg were too incendiary for comfort.\n\nOr to Serbia, where Otpor!, the pro-democracy movement that saw off Slobodan Milošević, practised “laughtivism” – the use of humour to pursue political change. “We took an oil barrel, taped a picture of Milosevic to it and set it up in the middle of Belgrade’s shopping district,” their philosopher-in-chief Srđja Popović later wrote. “Next to it we placed a baseball bat. Then we went for coffee, and watched the fun unfold.” Police, confused by the gaiety that ensued, ended up arresting the barrel. The regime was made to look foolish. Otpor! grew into the most effective opposition to Milošević and – using humour and ample US funding – helped overthrow the dictator two years later.\n\nPopović now tours the globe preaching the virtues of humour as an agent of political change. In which context: why are British satirists so beleaguered? Perhaps because they sense that their work has effected change, but that the change has been negative – that is, spreading cynicism about politics in general. That’s certainly a possible consequence of Britain’s gossipy non-partisan “satire”, where politicians are mocked indiscriminately and satirists seldom imply any moral framework of their own.\n\nIf they want to raise, or change, their game, history gives them grounds for optimism. But the old models won’t do: new political paradigms need new forms of satire. What is today’s Milosevic mugshot on a barrel? There are clues on the live circuit, where Bridget Christie and Josie Long have done innovative satirical work.\n\nBut if today’s “armies of comedy” do aspire to change the world, they should be careful what they wish for. At the White House correspondents’ dinner in 2011, Seth Meyers won rave notices for his jokes at the expense of a certain real-estate mogul in the audience.\n\n“Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican,” wisecracked Meyers. “Which is surprising, since I just assumed that he was running as a joke.” The humiliation Trump felt reportedly hardened his resolve to stand, and we know what happened next. Truly, jokes can change the world – if not always for the better."],[8,"Rwandan Poverty Statistics: Exposing the ‘Donor Darling’","In his book entitled Poor Numbers, Morten Jerven cautioned against taking African development statics at face value, given the high political and financial stakes attached to these numbers, as well as the lack of institutional mechanisms to prevent political interference in many countries. Few countries illustrate his case more starkly than Rwanda. As An Ansoms et al pointed out in an article in the print issue of ROAPE earlier this year, ‘Statistics versus livelihoods: questioning Rwanda’s pathway out of poverty’, the Rwandan government has used its record on poverty reduction and economic growth to legitimize its authoritarian rule and to deflect criticism of its human rights record, just as the previous regime had done up until 1990. Furthermore, Rwanda’s spectacular recovery after the genocide has made it somewhat of a “donor darling”, and has enabled the government to attract significant foreign resources in the form of aid from donors desperate to claim a share in this African success story.\n\nYet, questions have been mounting in recent years about the reality and sustainability of the “Rwandan miracle”, given the heavy-handed nature of the state-led agricultural transformation project (Dawson et al. 2016), and the government’s propensity for debt-financed investments in unproductive prestige projects, such as the Kigali Convention Centre. These questions came to a head in September 2015, when the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) published a poverty profile (NISR, 2015) based on the most recent household budget survey (EICV4 by its French acronym). The report claimed that the proportion of Rwandans living below the poverty line had fallen from 45% in 2010 to 39% in 2014, after a string of similarly successful decreases in the previous surveys. Two months later, Filip Reyntjens published a critique, claiming that the “decrease” in poverty had been artificially engineered by NISR by changing the type of poverty line used, from an “average” consumption basket based on actual consumption patterns of poor Rwandan households, to a “minimum” or “optimal” consumption basket, containing mostly highly caloric and inexpensive food types.\n\nThe change is not in itself problematic, as the choice of a poverty line is always, to some extent, arbitrary and there are many different acceptable ways to define a poverty line. The normative minimum consumption basket adopted by NISR is one such way. However, to make trend comparisons, all experts agree that it is crucial to use consistent methodologies, assumptions and definitions across time. Reyntjens claimed that had they done that, they would have found the proportion of people living below the minimum poverty line to have increased by 6 percentage points between 2010 and 2014. Unfortunately, Reyntjens never published the syntax files he used to compute his estimate. Neither did NISR accept to publish its own syntax files. Without this key piece of evidence, the debate has never been closed from a technical point of view, as it is impossible to show convincingly whether poverty has actually increased or decreased in Rwanda between 2010 and 2014.\n\nWe hope to contribute to settling this issue by publishing open, transparent and verifiable syntax files built using a publicly available dataset, which can be downloaded from NISR’s own microdata catalogue on its website (the two syntax files can be opened with .txt notepad or STATA software here). There are many ways to compute these things and there are innumerable adjustments and assumptions that must be made to arrive at an aggregate number. Consequently, it is difficult to replicate exactly the official estimates without access to the original syntax files. However, we hope that by submitting these to public scrutiny, such differences can be ironed out in an open and transparent manner, and any mistakes can be corrected to arrive at an estimate that all parties can accept. In constructing these estimates, our main priority has been to ensure consistency between the two surveys. We therefore try to use exactly the same code and assumptions in both years wherever possible. Below, we provide an overview of the key parameters and assumptions that entered the construction of these indices. Since there are several different poverty lines that have been generated by now, we decided to compute trends for all of them, namely:\n\nAverage consumption basket: representing the minimum amount required to consume 2,500 kcal per day (adjusted for age and gender), using prevailing culinary habits of poor Rwandan households in 2001. This was the official poverty line used in 2001, 2005, 2010. Updated average basket: representing the minimum amount required to consume 2,500 kcal per day (adjusted for age and gender), using prevailing culinary habits of poor Rwandan households in 2014. This was the new poverty line computed by NISR in 2014, which should have been used in EICV4, but was never used because it was deemed too high. Minimum consumption basket: representing the minimum amount required to consume 2,500 kcal per day (adjusted for age and gender), using optimal (i.e. cheap and highly caloric) food types. This was the official poverty line used in 2014 (EICV4). Reyntjen’s poverty line[1] : Reyntjens argued that since the minimum consumption basket was 19% lower than the updated average basket, trend comparisons with 2010 should have been made using a poverty line that was 19% lower than the one used in 2010. [1] For this poverty line, we did not construct a food basket, but simply calculated 81% of the figure from the total poverty line computed from the average consumption basket.\n\nIn all consumption baskets, the quantities and caloric values are kept constant across surveys. Prices for each item are given as the national median price across regions and across months, as reported in the auto-consumption module of the EICV survey (see table 3 below). Consumption aggregates have been adjusted for spatial and temporal price differences using a Laspeyres index (see table 2 below). The Laspeyres index was chosen because it yielded estimates that were closest to official poverty estimates in EICV3 for the average basket. The choice of price index does not affect the conclusions of this blogpost.\n\nThe results are reported in table 1 below. All poverty lines yield similar trends when used consistently over time, indicating that poverty increased between 5% and 7% points between 2010 and 2014. All changes are statistically significant at the 5% level.\n\nIt should be noted that our results differ from those obtained by simply updating the poverty line for inflation using CPI data, as was done by NISR in their 2016 trend report (NISR, 2016). In principle, if the data are of good quality and sufficiently disaggregated, both methods should be equivalent and should not yield significantly different results. This therefore raises questions about the quality / reliability of official CPI data, and/or the quality of price data collected by the EICV. In either case, this would undermine our ability to correctly estimate poverty levels in Rwanda. The discrepancies found here should invite us to more closely scrutinize official statistics coming out of the Rwandan statistical office. GDP growth figures appear to be incompatible with the findings of the EICV survey, given than agriculture still accounts for about one third of GDP and two thirds of the labour force.\n\nTable 1: Summary of poverty lines and poverty rates\n\nTable 2: Laspeyres price index by quarter and province (computed from price data in auto-consumption file)\n\nTable 3: Food baskets used to compute poverty lines\n\nThe authors of this article have asked for anonymity.  \n\nFeatured Photograph: Parc National des Volcans, Rwanda.

Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of Southwark council, and part of the newly established Grenfell Fire Response Team, said in a statement: \"We want to make clear that whilst the emergency and local community response was nothing short of heroic, we know that the initial response was simply not good enough on the ground. People are angry, and rightfully so. \"Our focus is now ensuring those affected are being cared for and looked after. \"This new team is now leading the recovery and response to the Grenfell Tower fire, which has been one of the most tragic and horrendous events ever seen.\" London local government has a resilience response that can be invoked when a major London incident like the Grenfell fire happens. Yet the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea invoked this only on the afternoon of Friday 16 June – almost three days after the incident. The response team, a coalition including the Metropolitan police and the London Fire Brigade, said it was currently responding to \"what the community are telling us they need\", adding that people who came to Westway Sports and Fitness Centre would be able to access services and support provided by a new team around the clock. It said housing was the main priority and that by the end of Monday 19 June it is aiming to have contacted all known families affected by the fire and completed an assessment of what they need. The response team said the latest information it has is that 201 households have so far received emergency accommodation to date, of which 113 are homeless – almost five days after the fire. The Red Cross, which provides humanitarian aid in crisis zones, has been drafted in to provide community assistance and will be part of the teams allocated to every household affected. BuzzFeed News first revealed earlier that officials from a nearby London council had said they were assuming control over aspects of the Grenfell Tower response operation – as accusations of mismanagement of the crisis mounted against Kensington and Chelsea council. Volunteers and humanitarian charity workers were told by officials from Ealing council late on Saturday night there would be a complete handover to the west London authority – the same day the prime minister admitted support on the ground for survivors of the disaster \"was not good enough\". Rupinder Hardy, a manager at Ealing council, had been called by Ealing emergency response team on Friday to assist with the Grenfell Tower crisis, and was at Westway Sports Centre visiting family and meeting with volunteers from 7am on Saturday morning until after midnight.\n\nSpeaking to BuzzFeed News, she said: \"I am going to have a meeting now to see what happened during the night, and what we need to focus on going forward. \"Now we've got a lot of Ealing people coming, and we've got representatives from government offices. \"I've suggested yesterday what I'd like to see, and I'd like to get this to feel like a rest centre, to feel welcoming, to feel inclusive, to give the opportunity to the community to be somewhere where they can talk to community groups and to be heard, and to have their outcomes met.\" Standing in the entrance of the Westway Sports Centre, which has turned into a storage place for canned food items, Philip Lee-Morris, local authority liaison officer response from Ealing council, told BuzzFeed News: \"Yesterday we came to the rest centre to try and do as much as we can to turn this effort into a truly humanitarian relief effort for the entire community, to recognise that this tragic event has impacted so many people and we need to ensure there is somewhere that people can come to get help.\" When asked about the challenges Grenfell Tower residents and evacuated locals had faced, he said: \"I think we need to make sure everyone is informed, we need to make sure that people know why we are here, and I think people need to feel as welcomed as possible.\" On Sunday morning the police cordons on the way to Westway, which families had to cross, had been removed. Volunteers had said the cordon had made the refuge centre unwelcoming, and look like \"a crime scene\". Lee-Morris added: \"There is so much tension, so much frustration in the community that we're hoping this can be the one place that people can truly come together, exchange their feelings, relate to people concerned what they have been through and we're hoping to provide that resting, calm environment.\" When asked about the biggest concerns of residents he said: \"I think it comes down mainly to communication so it's the local people and those affected by this – it's unspeakable – it's ensuring they know the local authority is here, and local authorities through the entire city have come together, volunteers in their dozens are prepared to come out and do whatever they can.\" The news of other councils and central government stepping in comes days after the fire left a community mourning, with at least 58 people presumed dead and scores of families left homeless. Kensington and Chelsea council has been under pressure since the fire, with residents protesting outside Kensington Town Hall on Friday night. The BBC reported on Sunday that central government staff had been drafted in to manage the response to the fire.\n\nKensington and Chelsea council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown was quoted as saying: \"Kensington and Chelsea council is working closely with the government, charities, volunteer and resident groups and the emergency services to help rehouse and assist all those affected. \"Of course, people rightly have questions about the causes of the fire and why it spread so quickly and these will be answered.\" Families from Grenfell Tower and local residents have in the last few days complained about the lack of support from Kensington and Chelsea council. In an updated press statement on Saturday evening, the council said: \"Kensington Town Hall has unfortunately been closed due to yesterday’s incident,\" referring to the protest by residents. A pressing concern for Grenfell Tower residents, as well as households in the surrounding area who had been evacuated, is the issue of housing. On Friday morning, Kensington and Chelsea council confirmed that 109 households had been given temporary accommodation in hotels. A statement said: \"We plan to house residents of Grenfell Tower as locally as we can. But we may well need help from our close neighbours. We want to rehouse people in a good home as quickly as we can. \"The council is committed to looking after the immediate and longer-term housing needs of all those affected by the fire.\""],[8,"Lib Dems pledge 1p income tax rise to fund NHS","A Liberal Democrat government would raise income tax to help fund the NHS and social care, the party has pledged.\n\nIt said a penny-in-the-pound rise on all income tax bands and on dividends would raise around £6bn a year.\n\nThe Tories said 30 million people would be hit by the tax rises. Labour said its NHS plans would be in its manifesto.\n\nThe Lib Dem pledge is complicated by devolution, such as Scotland having its own tax-raising powers.\n\nThe NHS is facing one of its toughest-ever financial challenges as it struggles with a growing and ageing population.\n\nIn the UK, £140bn was spent on health last year and around £25bn on social care.\n\nThe proposed tax rises are the Lib Dem's first significant policy announcement of the general election campaign.\n\nParty leader Tim Farron said he wanted \"to be honest with people and say that we will all need to chip in a little more\".\n\nHe told the BBC: \"This is an average of £3 a week for the average earner in this country, so a pint of beer a week to pay for a health and social care service that will last us from cradle to grave.\"\n\nA Lib Dem government would raise all tax bands by one percentage point.\n\nThe party estimates someone earning £15,000 would pay an extra £33 a year in tax, with someone on £50,000 paying an extra £383.\n\nThis would not apply in Scotland as income tax levels are devolved to the Scottish Parliament, where the Lib Dems are the fifth largest party.\n\nThe plans also include a UK-wide rise of 1p on dividend income taxes if you hold shares in a company.\n\nIn the 2018/19 financial year, the party says the extra taxes would raise:\n\nThe total raised is projected to reach £6.6bn a year by the end of the parliament.\n\nThe money would be guaranteed for the NHS and social care in England, but it is up to the devolved governments in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland to choose whether to spend the money on health or elsewhere.\n\nMr Farron added: \"Theresa May doesn't care about the NHS or social care. People are lying on trolleys in hospital corridors and she has done nothing. The truth is you can't have a strong NHS with a hard Brexit.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats say the money raised will primarily be invested in social care which will get £2bn a year, as well as care outside of hospital, mental health and public health.\n\nBut it says its ultimate ambition is a dedicated health and care tax.\n\nNorman Lamb, for the party, added: \"Simply providing more money on its own is not enough and that's why this is just the first step in our plan to protect health and care services long-term.\n\n\"We also need to do much more to keep people fit and healthy and out of hospital, and that is why this new funding will be targeted to those areas that have the greatest impact on patient care such as social care, general practice, mental health and public health.\"\n\nThe outgoing Conservative government has promised to increase funding for the health service by £8bn by 2020 and £2bn for social care. The Lib Dems say their extra £6bn a year would be in addition to these plans.\n\nA £6bn a year rise in income for the NHS and social care would be \"generous\" compared with recent increases in their budgets, but against the historical average it is \"quite small scale\", the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said.\n\nIFS spokesman George Stoye told BBC News that about half of adults in Britain pay income tax, so a penny in the pound rise would mean incomes in these households cut on average by 0.6%.\n\nConservative Jane Ellison said: \"Now we know - a vote for anyone other than Theresa May means you will pay more tax.\n\n\"Jeremy Corbyn, the Lib Dems and SNP will hit 30 million people in the pocket with higher income taxes.\n\n\"Only a vote for Theresa May on 8 June can provide the strong and stable leadership we need to get a good deal in the Brexit negotiations, keep taxes low, and secure our growing economy.\n\n\"It is the only way we can build on the record funding we've given the NHS.\"\n\nLabour said its plans for funding the NHS would be in the party's manifesto although it has already said it would halt hospital cuts."],[8,"No small change","Radhabai has experienced first-hand the transformative effects that basic income can have on the lives of the destitute and the hopelessly poor. Still in her early 30s, Radhabai is a tribal woman from Ghodakhurd village in Madhya Pradesh. She was a child bride at 11 and a mother soon after she entered her teens. The eldest of her three children is now an 18-year-old woman.\n\nRadhabai’s village was selected, along with a few others, for unconditional cash transfer for a pilot carried out by the non-governmental organisation Self Employed Women’s Association of India (SEWA) with Unicef. Every adult in her village was given ₹300 a month and every child ₹150. The money was given to each adult, rather than a common family member, and each child’s money was given to the mother. This ensured there was no domestic strife over how the money was to be spent. Radhabai’s family received ₹1,050 every month during the two-year pilot — a handsome amount for a family that could barely make ends meet and was always in debt. There were no conditions on how the money should be spent, so it was up to individuals and households to make their choices.\n\nAt a conference on basic income held end-March in New Delhi, Radhabai explained that her family used the additional income to, among other things, buy a bullock and a few goats. The bullock helped plough a small patch of land they owned and the goats supplemented their income. The additional income also meant her children could attend school regularly instead of going to work, and her husband could work on the farm instead of being a daily wager.\n\nAfter the pilot ended in 2013, the family was once again hard up to meet its expenses. Radhabai continues to rear goats and work on her family’s patch of land. But her husband and children had to seek work at a brick kiln and papad making unit.\n\nAs Radhabai’s experience illustrates, an assured and regular additional income, however small, has the potential to change lives. Pilots conducted in India and elsewhere show that additional income is often used to acquire assets including basic household requirements, besides increasing spend on food. A small amount gets put aside for a rainy day — such as medical emergencies.\n\nLazy assumptions\n\nThe SEWA-Unicef pilot was tested in eight MP villages — in four of these villages a monthly amount was transferred to every household for 12-17 months; in the other four villages there was no income transfer, and these were the ‘control villages’.\n\nThe aim was to study the impact of cash transfer on household behaviour. The amount transferred to individuals in non-tribal villages was less than what people in Radhabai’s village received in the first year of the pilot.\n\nThis pilot and others elsewhere in the world have demonstrated, surprisingly, that unconditional transfer of cash or basic income does not lead to the poor becoming lazy or giving up working nor increasing spending on liquor, tobacco and other demerit items of consumption.\n\nOn the contrary, their spending on demerit consumption declines not just as a proportion of the income but also in absolute terms, says Abhijit V Banerjee, Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Director of Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) — a network of professors and universities working to reduce poverty by ensuring that policy is informed by scientific evidence. Such change in behaviour has also been established in a World Bank review of 44 estimates from 17 different studies, Banerjee points out.\n\nGuy Standing, a School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, research professor in development studies and a founder member and honorary co-president of the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN), who is closely associated with SEWA and the cash transfer pilot in MP, reported similar findings in other pilots of this kind.\n\nStanding says basic income impacts in many positive ways — it reduces inequality and inequity and has transformative and welfare effect. Teenaged girls and women with disability, especially, stood to gain more. It is also emancipatory, he says, to an extent that far exceeds its monetary value.\n\nIncome and/or welfare\n\nThe Economic Survey of 2016-17, authored by the chief economic adviser in the finance ministry Arvind Subramanian and his team, too has favoured unconditional cash transfers to the poor, given the inefficiencies in the plethora of welfare schemes of the Union and State governments and their failure to lift people out of poverty. The survey points out that despite these schemes — 950 Central and Centrally sponsored sub-schemes in 2016-17, which have now been pruned to 675 — States with the largest number of poor were grappling with inadequate funds.\n\nDue to misallocation, the districts that account for 40 per cent of the poor households got about 26 per cent of the resources.\n\nSubramanian argues for replacing some of the ongoing welfare schemes with universal basic income (UBI), rather than running them parallelly. However, his boss, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley recently ruled out the rollout of basic income schemes. Jaitley claims he is supportive of the UBI but it was not politically feasible.\n\nHe is right. Withdrawing all or most welfare schemes will spark off opposition from politicians, bureaucrats and the beneficiaries, including the many who are not the intended beneficiaries. Running them parallelly will be very expensive for the country — although some economists have recommended rolling in UBI before withdrawing welfare schemes.\n\nGiven the cost involved in implementing a basic income programme, the Economic Survey had suggested quasi-universality. Covering 75 per cent of the population with UBI could cost the economy about 4.9 per cent of the GDP if the basic income is fixed at ₹7,620 per individual.\n\nBanerjee says existing schemes cannot be withdrawn until there is confidence that the basic income schemes would work and cash transfers are shown to be more efficient. “Politically, telling people that you are withdrawing some benefits and giving them something else, it will be a non-starter,” he says. The concept of basic income needs to be proven on ground, and this has not been done, he adds. It could take at least five years of pilots and studies before a conversation on withdrawing existing schemes can take place.\n\nNot all pilots need be conducted in India, says Banerjee, adding that answers to many unknowns need to be found. Among the unknowns are questions such as the duration of basic income transfer needed to make a permanent difference to an individual’s life, whether the transfer should be lump sum or on monthly basis, and the kind of nudges people may need to spend efficiently. Lump sum amounts tend to be spent on accumulating assets while small monthly transfers are spent on food. The poor generally find it difficult to save small sums to spend on expensive items later, as previous studies have shown.\n\nJ-PAL hopes to find conclusive answers through a 10-year pilot in Kenya. Standing feels that a shorter, five-year pilot would prove as effective in finding answers without tiring out beneficiaries with the follow-ups on how they spend the money and the impact on their life.\n\nMoving targets\n\nWhen it comes to designing universal basic income pilots in India, opinions vary on who the target group should be. Suggestions range from women and children only, to the elderly, scheduled tribes and the most backward classes. The SEWA-Unicef pilot covered villages of scheduled tribes and others, but it was the scheduled tribes, being the poorest communities, that benefited the most from income transfers. The trouble with targeting women and elderly is that they form a heterogeneous group, whereas communities of scheduled tribes and most backward classes make for a more homogeneous group as most of them live in similarly deprived conditions and, therefore, it is easier to monitor the impact of income transfers vis-à-vis control groups.\n\nSarath Davala, coordinator for Indian Network for Basic Income, who was part of SEWA’s basic income project in MP observes that even short-term pilots have a sustainable impact on the beneficiaries. Follow-up reviews show they continue to experience positive effects of the basic income transfers even four years after the conclusion of the programme. For instance, people in Ghodakhurd are more sufficient in food than those in the control villages. Their land is more productive and they have higher incomes than the others, more livestock (both cattle and goats) and display better healthcare behaviour.\n\nIncome transfers, even when it is a small amount, can make a perceptible difference to people’s lives, as pilots in MP have demonstrated. The Union government currently feels financially and politically constrained to implement UBI. No doubt it is a difficult decision, but to build consensus, the government should begin supporting multiple pilots around the country."],[8,"Theresa May's Misery Manifesto is the longest suicide note in political history [EDITORIAL]","May plans to raise the higher rate income tax threshold from £45,000 to £50,000, meaning those earning more will pay less tax.\n\nAnd it still plans to drop corporation tax to 17% by 2020. In line with May’s Brexit plan to turn the UK into a tax haven for wealthy individuals and corporations, at the price of investment in public services, and shifting the tax burden down the economic food chain.\n\nNext, the assault on education.\n\nThe provision of free school meals has long provided critical support to children from impoverished homes. Because hungry children struggle to learn.\n\nLabour’s manifesto pledges universal free school meals for all children, to remove the stigma of those who currently require means testing. It will be funded by a small tax on private education fees. In contrast, Theresa May is coming after free school dinners. Pledging instead, a free school breakfast. Conservatives say the policy will be an improvement and increase provision to children, while simultaneously arguing it will save £650m a year. So let’s be clear, this is a cut. In additional to wider budget cuts of 3% on thousands of schools.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) agrees with the assessment of teachers and parents, confirming that these are the ‘deepest cuts’ to education in 30 years. Ironically, since Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister.\n\nThe decision facing voters on 8 June is stark. A fully-funded National Education Service under Labour, or the misery manifesto from the Conservatives.\n\nSince 2010, the Conservatives have claimed that austerity measures were aimed at ending the budget deficit. This has been a central campaign promise at the 2010 and 2015 general election. They failed both times. Now, Theresa May is making the same promise again.\n\nThe real impact of Conservative economic policies is clear and incontestable. First, it created the slowest economic recovery in recorded history. Second, it made that recovery entirely unequal. In fact, only two regions of the UK are currently as well off, or better off, than they were before the financial crisis. Unsurprisingly, they are London and the south-east. Every other region of the UK is poorer than it was in 2007, and some are in outright depression:\n\nWhile Labour is offering a £10 minimum wage, and renationalising high inflation utilities like water, energy and rail to start resetting the economy – May is continuing course at full steam. Her manifesto reverses all promises related to wealth inequality. The pledges of a £9 minimum wage, a rail fare price freeze, and a tax freeze on wages have all been scrapped.\n\nPerhaps the most offensive elements of the Misery Manifesto are its efforts to break universal social care for elderly people. Under May, anyone with an estate of over £100,000 will be charged for their social care bill after they die. With current house prices, this would hit most people in Britain who own their own homes – and end any of the social mobility chances offered by property ownership. Because the planned nest egg would go straight to the Treasury. From the party that opposed the Mansion Tax because they felt owning a mansion didn’t mean vast personal wealth, this is high hypocrisy.\n\nThe move has been coined the “dementia tax“, because it is likely to impact dementia patients and their families the hardest. Due to the privatisation of social care under Conservative and New Labour governments, the annual cost of a nursing home place is now £39,300. The average annual wage in the UK is just £27,600.\n\nThe entire manifesto reads like a dystopian novel. A boost for animal cruelty with plans to bring back fox-hunting. May promises to back the environmentally unsustainable fracking of shale gas. Press freedom and integrity take a kicking with the scrapping of the long-promised second part of the Leveson Inquiry. Further insecurity for elderly voters as the triple lock protection on their pensions is scrapped. The end of universal winter fuel payments, meaning arduous form-filling for people in their twilight years. And the return of academic selection at just 11 years old, with the return of grammar schools. And initial responses suggest voters won’t be putting up with it.\n\nMay’s plans do indeed constitute a Misery Manifesto. Because, frankly, it offers little else to anyone not yet rich enough to buy their own island.\n\nGet Involved!\n\n– Register to vote in the 8 June general election.\n\n– Discuss the key policy issues with family members, colleagues and neighbours.

I see a living being. I see a friend. I feel a soul.' \n\n'After that, her life was always going to be about animals,' they added. 'She lived her life to the full and was a very caring, generous person.\n\n'She would stand up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves including the animals and campaigned and raised money for animal charities. \n\n'Rosa completed a skydive in 2014 to raise money for Animal Asia and then travelled to China to visit the sanctuary for Moon bears to see for herself the work they do, and just recently returned from a visit to a Sun bear rehabilitation centre in Borneo.'\n\nMr King, 56, and his 54-year-old wife also thanked the public for the 'abundance of love and sympathy' which they had received since Rosa's death.  \n\nScroll down for video \n\nEmergency services initially described Rosa's death as 'non suspicious', but it has since emerged the owners were warned about safety failings several times over the past decade.\n\nInspectors had highlighted problems with ageing safety barriers and a damaged fence, and ordered the zoo to amend its escape protocols as long ago as 2007.   \n\nFollowing a further inspection six years later, the park had still failed to implement suggested changes, including overhauling risk assessments and 'safe working practices'.\n\nThe authors again implored the owners to conduct a 'wholesale review of the risk assessments'.\n\nIt is unclear if Hamerton or its owner Andrew Swales made attempts to abide by the conditions. \n\nMs King is understood to have been savaged in the Tiger Falls enclosure, which opened last year for its two rare Malayan tigers Cicip and Sahaja.\n\nIt is believed the barrier separating the enclosure and the tiger pen experienced a malfunction or was accidentally left unlocked when Miss King was cleaning.  \n\nThe park owner's son, Chris Swales, was questioned by police in a bid to find out what happened.\n\nThe 30-year-old son of Hamerton's owner, Andrew Swales, was taken away in an unmarked police car by detectives for questioning. Two other workers were seen helping police with their enquiries on site.\n\nIt is understood that all employees will be interviewed but have the choice whether to do so at the zoo or in a dedicated witness suite. \n\nThere is no suggestion any of the people questioned were responsible for Ms King's death and no arrests have been made.  \n\nOn June 1 teams continued to comb the zoo for clues as to how a tiger managed to get into the enclosure where Rosa was working.\n\nA blonde-haired woman could be seen standing in the area where Rosa was killed, looking emotional.   \n\nThe zoo said it was 'co-operating fully' with the joint investigation by police and the council.\n\nA spokesman said: 'Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Rosa's family and friends, many of whom worked alongside her at the zoo.\n\n'We are cooperating fully with the investigation that is currently being conducted by Huntingdonshire District Council environmental health department.' \n\nCambridgeshire police said the tiger has not been harmed, adding: 'We are jointly investigating with the council.' \n\nChief Inspector Donna Wass added: 'While there are no suspicious circumstances, the death of the zookeeper is still unexplained and the police have a duty to report to the coroner, which is why the police investigation is ongoing.\n\n'Huntingdon District Council have a responsibility for health and safety and licencing at the zoo, and are investigating these aspects.\n\n'This is why both parties are still involved and will work together on a joint investigation.'\n\nThe case has been referred to the Cambridgeshire coroner's office. A spokesman said an inquest will be opened next week. \n\nFollowing her death, it emerged that Rosa told a friend how she feared another of her animals saw her as 'his next meal'. \n\nFriend Tracey Eyre, 48, said Miss King was always vigilant as she knew she was dealing with 'dangerous, wild animals'. \n\nMs Eyre told the Daily Mirror: 'She said [another tiger] Blizzard often looked at her as if to say 'you're going to be my next meal if I get the chance'.\n\n'She adored those tigers, they were like family to her, they were her little babies.' \n\nEarlier this week, zoo inspection reports, obtained under Freedom of Information laws, revealed how Hamerton was in the spotlight for a catalogue of management issues\n\n In 2012, inspectors ordered the renewal of ageing safety barriers and a damaged perimeter fence within three months, and said the escape protocol 'should be amended' to categorise animals of varying risks.\n\nZoos are regulated by local authorities across the UK, with no central government database of facilities. Government-appointed vets conduct inspections every three to four years, with annual follow-ups supposed to be undertaken by the local authority.\n\nHowever, records indicate Hamerton has not been inspected in any capacity since August 2015. \n\nDuring that visit, no mention was made of security issues outlined in previous reports. The inspectors reported: '[Animal] escapes have been notified when necessary.' Representatives of Hamerton failed to respond to requests for comment last night.\n\nChris Draper, of wildlife charity Born Free, said: 'From these reports we have no way of determining whether these conditions were ever met. This zoo has clearly not been meeting some safety standards for many years. It is still unclear what happened to Rosa King but this is very worrying.'\n\nFollowing her death, tributes poured in for the zookeeper.  \n\nSteven Eyre, a friend of Miss King's, said: 'She was dedicated to her job completely and was aware of all the risks. She was very meticulous about everything that she did ... We're all at a bit of a loss to understand what happened.'\n\nFormer zoo volunteer Zach Vaughan added: 'Rosa took her job very seriously and was always safe. She wouldn't have gone into the tiger enclosure for no reason.'\n\nMiss King's friend, wildlife photographer Garry Chisholm, added: 'I have lost a very dear friend who loved the animals in her care very much.\n\n'I would like to say more but I am struggling to take in this news at the moment.'\n\nWriting on Facebook, Mr Chisholm added: 'I was deeply saddened to hear of the tragic events at Hamerton yesterday which resulted in the death of a good friend of mine.\n\n'Rosa was a follower of this page and I would like to make the following tribute statement in her memory:\n\n'Rosa wasn't just a keeper at Hamerton Zoo – she WAS Hamerton Zoo. \n\n'She was the absolute central point of it, the focal point of it. She was the shining light of it. It revolved around her.\n\n'Her passion for the animals in her care was exceptional though her favourites were undoubtedly the cheetahs which she would refer to as her pride and joy. \n\n'Rosa would raise money for cheetah conservation by actively taking part in parachute jumps and I was delighted when she approached me asking if she could use one of my pictures to promote her money raising campaign. \n\n'I feel privileged to have known Rosa and been able to call her a friend. She will be greatly missed, not just by me but by everyone who came to know her. \n\n'The only consolation I can take from today's tragic events is that Rosa is now reunited with her beloved Ares the cheetah and Blizzard and Ladybelle her beloved tigers.'  \n\nPhilip Caso, a 20-year-old zoology student from Peterborough, got to know Ms King through doing work experience at the zoo each summer and commended her conservation efforts. \n\nIn a tribute on Facebook he wrote: 'I'm literally devastated to hear that one of the most inspirational women I knew died at Hamerton Zoo.\n\n'Rosa loved and respected those animals to the point where each and every one was like a child to her. \n\n'Her passion for her job has really inspired me and I was just glad I got the chance to know her. Thinking of all the other keepers.'\n\nPhotographer Hollie Gordon, who said she became friends with Ms King through visits to the zoo, said: 'Her passion for the animals, the zoo and conservation really shone through. She loved them all!'\n\nThe 24-year-old, from Blackpool, added: 'I am in shock by what has happened. \n\n'Terribly upset and can't quite believe I won't see her again with a big smile on her face and working with her beloved cats.' \n\nMr Neve, 46, took part in a one-to-one tiger-feeding experience less than two months ago, where he met Miss King. \n\nHe said: 'I'm actually in shock. I met Rosa seven weeks ago when I went to feed the tigers.\n\n'Getting to feed the tigers was fantastic. The day out was given to me as a Christmas present; I went down with the whole family and it was just a really, really good day.' \n\nHe added: 'She had a real passion for the cats and had obviously been there since they had arrived at the zoo. Her knowledge about tigers was second to none.\n\n'The experience was only supposed to last around 45 minutes, but I was there for two hours just talking to her about the tigers - it was a real pleasure.' \n\nMs King was a self-confessed fan of big cats, and also raised funds three years ago for a charity helping bears.\n\nLinking to a JustGiving page, through which she raised more than £900, she told donors she was going to skydive for Animals Asia.\n\nShe wrote on Facebook: 'Those of you who know me and have spoken to me around the Zoo will be aware of my love of big cats, but probably aren't as aware of my love of bears!\n\n'I am a big supporter of the animal charity Animals Asia, who rescue and care for bears effected (sic) by the pet trade and in particular the cruel bear bile trade.'   \n\nThe British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums released a short statement in regards to the incident via its website.\n\nIt said: 'The British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) is extremely saddened to hear that a zoo keeper has been killed by a tiger at Hamerton Zoo in Cambridgeshire.\n\n'Whilst the zoo is not a member of BIAZA, the death of a keeper affects the whole zoo community and our thoughts are with the keeper's family, friends and colleagues at this time.'  \n\nHamerton Zoo Park opened in June 1990 and covers 25 acres. It includes enclosures for Malaysian tigers, Bengal tigers, cheetahs, wolves, corsac foxes and kangaroos, as well as a variety of birds, reptiles and domestic animals. \n\nIn 2013, Sarah McClay, 24, from Glasgow, was mauled to death by a Sumatran tiger at South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Cumbria.\n\nThe zoo was fined £255,000 after a faulty gate allowed a tiger called Padang to escape its den and pounce as she did her rounds.\n\nThe zoo went on to be branded the worst in Britain after nearly 500 animals died amid 'deplorable' welfare standards.\n\nThree zookeepers were killed by big cats at zoos run by the late John Aspinall, who believed they should be allowed close access to bond with the animals.\n\nIn 1980, he was forced to shoot two Siberian tigers that killed keepers Brian Stocks and Bob Wilson within weeks of each other at Howletts, near Canterbury.\n\nIn 1994, Trevor Smith, 32, head keeper at the same zoo, was killed by a tiger."],[8,"Western Wars Have Killed Four Million Muslims Since 1990","Landmark research proves that the US-led ‘war on terror’ has killed as many as 2 million people\n\nLast month, the Washington DC-based Physicians for Social Responsibility (PRS) released a landmark study concluding that the death toll from 10 years of the “War on Terror” since the 9/11 attacks is at least 1.3 million, and could be as high as 2 million.\n\nThe 97-page report by the Nobel Peace Prize-winning doctors’ group is the first to tally up the total number of civilian casualties from US-led counter-terrorism interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nThe PSR report is authored by an interdisciplinary team of leading public health experts, including Dr. Robert Gould, director of health professional outreach and education at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, and Professor Tim Takaro of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University.\n\nYet it has been almost completely blacked out by the English-language media, despite being the first effort by a world-leading public health organisation to produce a scientifically robust calculation of the number of people killed by the US-UK-led “war on terror”.\n\nThe PSR report is described by Dr Hans von Sponeck, former UN assistant secretary-general, as “a significant contribution to narrowing the gap between reliable estimates of victims of war, especially civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan and tendentious, manipulated or even fraudulent accounts”.\n\nThe report conducts a critical review of previous death toll estimates of “war on terror” casualties. It is heavily critical of the figure most widely cited by mainstream media as authoritative, namely, the Iraq Body Count (IBC) estimate of 110,000 dead. That figure is derived from collating media reports of civilian killings, but the PSR report identifies serious gaps and methodological problems in this approach.\n\nFor instance, although 40,000 corpses had been buried in Najaf since the launch of the war, IBC recorded only 1,354 deaths in Najaf for the same period. That example shows how wide the gap is between IBC’s Najaf figure and the actual death toll – in this case, by a factor of over 30.\n\nSuch gaps are replete throughout IBC’s database. In another instance, IBC recorded just three airstrikes in a period in 2005, when the number of air attacks had in fact increased from 25 to 120 that year. Again, the gap here is by a factor of 40.\n\nAccording to the PSR study, the much-disputed Lancet study that estimated 655,000 Iraq deaths up to 2006 (and over a million until today by extrapolation) was likely to be far more accurate than IBC’s figures. In fact, the report confirms a virtual consensus among epidemiologists on the reliability of the Lancet study.\n\nDespite some legitimate criticisms, the statistical methodology it applied is the universally recognised standard to determine deaths from conflict zones, used by international agencies and governments.\n\nPSR also reviewed the methodology and design of other studies showing a lower death toll, such as a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, which had a range of serious limitations.\n\nThat paper ignored the areas subject to the heaviest violence, namely Baghdad, Anbar and Nineveh, relying on flawed IBC data to extrapolate for those regions. It also imposed “politically-motivated restrictions” on collection and analysis of the data - interviews were conducted by the Iraqi Ministry of Health, which was “totally dependent on the occupying power” and had refused to release data on Iraqi registered deaths under US pressure.\n\nIn particular, PSR assessed the claims of Michael Spaget, John Sloboda and others who questioned the Lancet study data collection methods as potentially fraudulent. All such claims, PSR found, were spurious.\n\nThe few “justified criticisms,” PSR concludes, “do not call into question the results of the Lancet studies as a whole. These figures still represent the best estimates that are currently available”. The Lancet findings are also corroborated by the data from a new study in PLOS Medicine, finding 500,000 Iraqi deaths from the war. Overall, PSR concludes that the most likely number for the civilian death toll in Iraq since 2003 to date is about 1 million.\n\nTo this, the PSR study adds at least 220,000 in Afghanistan and 80,000 in Pakistan, killed as the direct or indirect consequence of US-led war: a “conservative” total of 1.3 million. The real figure could easily be “in excess of 2 million”.\n\nYet even the PSR study suffers from limitations. Firstly, the post-9/11 “war on terror” was not new, but merely extended previous interventionist policies in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSecondly, the huge paucity of data on Afghanistan meant the PSR study probably underestimated the Afghan death toll.\n\nThe war on Iraq did not begin in 2003, but in 1991 with the first Gulf War, which was followed by the UN sanctions regime.\n\nAn early PSR study by Beth Daponte, then a US government Census Bureau demographer, found that Iraq deaths caused by the direct and indirect impact of the first Gulf War amounted to around 200,000 Iraqis, mostly civilians. Meanwhile, her internal government study was suppressed.\n\nAfter US-led forces pulled out, the war on Iraq continued in economic form through the US-UK imposed UN sanctions regime, on the pretext of denying Saddam Hussein the materials necessary to make weapons of mass destruction. Items banned from Iraq under this rationale included a vast number of items needed for everyday life.\n\nUndisputed UN figures show that 1.7 million Iraqi civilians died due to the West’s brutal sanctions regime, half of whom were children.\n\nThe mass death was seemingly intended. Among items banned by the UN sanctions were chemicals and equipment essential for Iraq’s national water treatment system. A secret US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) document discovered by Professor Thomas Nagy of the School of Business at George Washington University amounted, he said, to “an early blueprint for genocide against the people of Iraq”.\n\nIn his paper for the Association of Genocide Scholars at the University of Manitoba, Professor Nagi explained that the DIA document revealed “minute details of a fully workable method to ‘fully degrade the water treatment system’ of an entire nation” over a period of a decade. The sanctions policy would create “the conditions for widespread disease, including full scale epidemics,” thus “liquidating a significant portion of the population of Iraq”.\n\nThis means that in Iraq alone, the US-led war from 1991 to 2003 killed 1.9 million Iraqis; then from 2003 onwards around 1 million: totalling just under 3 million Iraqis dead over two decades.\n\nIn Afghanistan, PSR’s estimate of overall casualties could also be very conservative. Six months after the 2001 bombing campaign, The Guardian’s Jonathan Steele revealed that anywhere between 1,300 and 8,000 Afghans were killed directly, and as many as a further 50,000 people died avoidably as an indirect result of the war.\n\nIn his book, Body Count: Global Avoidable Mortality Since 1950 (2007), Professor Gideon Polya applied the same methodology used by The Guardian to UN Population Division annual mortality data to calculate plausible figures for excess deaths. A retired biochemist at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Polya concludes that total avoidable Afghan deaths since 2001 under ongoing war and occupation-imposed deprivation amount to around 3 million people, about 900,000 of whom are infants under five.\n\nAlthough Professor Polya’s findings are not published in an academic journal, his 2007 Body Count study has been recommended by California State University sociologist Professor Jacqueline Carrigan as “a data-rich profile of the global mortality situation” in a review published by the Routledge journal, Socialism and Democracy.\n\nAs with Iraq, US intervention in Afghanistan began long before 9/11 in the form of covert military, logistical and financial aid to the Taliban from around 1992 onwards. This US assistance propelled the Taliban’s violent conquest of nearly 90 percent of Afghan territory.\n\nIn a 2001 National Academy of Sciences report, Forced Migration and Mortality, leading epidemiologist Steven Hansch, a director of Relief International, noted that total excess mortality in Afghanistan due to the indirect impacts of war through the 1990s could be anywhere between 200,000 and 2 million. The Soviet Union, of course, also bore responsibility for its role in devastating civilian infrastructure, thus paving the way for these deaths.\n\nAltogether, this suggests that the total Afghan death toll due to the direct and indirect impacts of US-led intervention since the early nineties until now could be as high 3-5 million.\n\nAccording to the figures explored here, total deaths from Western interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan since the 1990s - from direct killings and the longer-term impact of war-imposed deprivation - likely constitute around 4 million (2 million in Iraq from 1991-2003, plus 2 million from the “war on terror”), and could be as high as 6-8 million people when accounting for higher avoidable death estimates in Afghanistan.\n\nSuch figures could well be too high, but will never know for sure. US and UK armed forces, as a matter of policy, refuse to keep track of the civilian death toll of military operations - they are an irrelevant inconvenience.\n\nDue to the severe lack of data in Iraq, almost complete non-existence of records in Afghanistan, and the indifference of Western governments to civilian deaths, it is literally impossible to determine the true extent of loss of life.\n\nIn the absence of even the possibility of corroboration, these figures provide plausible estimates based on applying standard statistical methodology to the best, if scarce, evidence available. They give an indication of the scale of the destruction, if not the precise detail.\n\nMuch of this death has been justified in the context of fighting tyranny and terrorism. Yet thanks to the silence of the wider media, most people have no idea of the true scale of protracted terror wrought in their name by US and UK tyranny in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSource: Middle East Eye The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Stop the War Coalition.

Fines Facebook $122 Million Over Disclosures in WhatsApp Deal","In response, Facebook said that it had acted in good faith in its deliberations with Europe’s antitrust officials, and that it would not appeal the financial penalty.\n\n“The errors we made in our 2014 filings were not intentional,” Facebook said in a statement. “The commission has confirmed that they did not impact the outcome of the merger review.”\n\nThe overall penalty amounted to a slap on the wrist — it pales in comparison with the tens of billions of dollars the company earns in online advertising every year, and Europe’s antitrust officials stopped short of voiding the deal completely.\n\nBut the fine signals that European officials are increasing their scrutiny of Facebook just as it becomes one of the largest technology companies on the planet.\n\nIncreased oversight has become something of a rite of passage for American technology companies operating in Europe.\n\nDuring the past two decades, Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, among others, have become targets of long antitrust investigations by the European authorities. That has often led to claims by tech executives that the region has an anti-American bias, accusations that European policy makers deny.\n\nFacebook, experts say, is only the latest in a long line of Silicon Valley companies to face European regulatory anger, though this time, the focus is likely to be on the reams of online data gathered, including information that Facebook collects on both its users and nonusers through third-party websites.\n\nOn Tuesday, French officials fined the social network €150,000 — another relatively small penalty — for failing to give the company’s users in that country sufficient control over how their data is collected and used. Dutch regulators also ruled that the company had broken privacy rules, but so far they have not imposed a fine.\n\nWhile Facebook started in the United States and has expanded aggressively across the developing world, its actions in Europe — and the response to those acts by local officials — are likely to have implications on its global operations.\n\nThe company’s international headquarters are in Dublin. Though that is mostly for tax purposes, it gives European data protection and antitrust officials wide scope to monitor and police Facebook activities involving its more than 1.5 billion users outside North America.\n\nIn the past, for instance, Facebook has been forced to alter its privacy settings for all of its users worldwide after European privacy campaigners brought legal challenges to how the social network collected and used people’s data.\n\nThe changes come as policy makers worldwide vie for influence over how people use digital services, including potentially putting limits on how companies like Facebook operate so as to exert some control over the internet.\n\n“It was inevitable that there would be this type of struggle,” Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, said in an interview last year. “The internet is not used to national borders.”\n\nOn Tuesday, ThailandpressuredFacebookto remove dozens of pages from its servers that broke the country’s laws about disparaging the monarchy. In Vietnam, Facebook agreed last month to take down some local content, including misleading articles and false accounts about senior government officials. Countries like Indonesia and the Philippines have also made demands against the company’s role in spreading potential misinformation.\n\nWhile Facebook has come under scrutiny in the United States for allowing so-called fake news to spread on its network, including before the American presidential election in November, federal lawmakers and policy makers have so far used a relatively light touch with the social network.\n\nAfter Facebook announced last year that it would use WhatsApp data to bolster its wider advertising business, American privacy campaigners filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, putting forward similar arguments to those made against the partnership in Europe.\n\nBut whereas European privacy regulators forced Facebook to stop collecting WhatsApp data for its wider purposes just a few months after the agreement was made public, American privacy campaigners say that they have yet to receive an answer from the Federal Trade Commission about their concerns. Facebook continues to collect and use WhatsApp data from people in the United States who use the service.\n\n“U.S. antitrust law has failed to keep up with the digital economy and the emergence of monopoly services,” Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said in an email. “There is far too much ‘lock in’ with a dominant provider, and far too much consolidation of personal data.”"],[8,"State and Corporate Climate Action Just Got Serious","More than 1,200 corporations, academic institutions and state and local governments said Monday that they plan to stand behind the Paris climate agreement, despite President Trump’s decision topull the U.S. out of the multinational pact.\n\nTrump’s Paris decision washed over the climate action landscape like a tsunami on Thursday. As the waters of that tsunami recede, states, cities and businesses are forging new connections and banding together against the next wave.\n\nHundreds of activists in front of the Eiffel Tower during the climate negotiations in Paris in December 2015.

The cities, states and businesses represent more than a third of the U.S. population and contribute $6.2 trillion to the U.S. economy, according to the press release accompanying the letter.\n\n“No single individual or group is leading the ‘We Are Still In’ movement,” Rebecca Carriero, a spokesperson for Bloomberg Philanthropies, which helped coordinate the statement, said. “It is an organic, bottom-up coalition of cities, states, businesses and universities that are standing together for the first time ever to announce that they will work together to maintain U.S. leadership on climate change and clean energy.”\n\nThe sheer breadth of the signatories is notable, but it fits with a larger pattern emerging in the U.S. following Trump’s announcement.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook presenting at Apple's annual worldwide developer conference.

Credit: Stephen Lam/REUTERS\n\nOn Thursday,211 U.S. mayors announced that their cities plan to honor the U.S. pledge to Paris, which involves cutting emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. They also committed to advocating for a more stringent 1.5°C (2.7°F) target that small island nations have long pushed for as a safe level of global warming for their continued existence.\n\nAs of Monday, 10 states have joined the newly formed U.S. Climate Alliance, a separate effort that has also committed to meeting the U.S. Paris pledge. That includes Massachusetts and Vermont, two states with Republican governors.\n\nHillary Clinton carried all of the states participating in the alliance, but a handful that broke for Trump are also reportedly considering joining it, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Montana.\n\nIn addition to being an existential issue, climate change is about dollars and cents and Trump’s decision could have major economic ramifications. Multinational corporations based in the U.S., for example, could face consumer backlash overseas, where Trump’s choice to leave the agreementhas been widely condemned.\n\nEnvironmental activists protest in front of the Brandenburge Gate, beside the U.S. embassy in Berlin, against the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.  Credit: Fabrizio Bensch/REUTERS\n\n“Pulling out of Paris would be the worst thing for brand America since Abu Ghraib,” Nigel Purvis, the chief executive of the consulting firm Climate Adviserstold the New York Times last week.\n\nCompanies re-committing to honor the U.S. pledge is one way to brunt some of that backlash. It will also help them prepare to meet more strict carbon emissions standards in any of the 194 countries that are planning to abide by their Paris pledges.\n\nThere’s also the reality that a number of the signatories have already begun transitioning to clean energy because it’s becoming more cost effective. Google, for example, plans to purchase the equivalent of100 percent of its energy needs from renewable sources this year.\n\nGiven the increasingly costly toll of climate change, perhaps it’s not surprising that all of the states that signed Monday's letter are coastal states. That likely reflects the reality that sea level rise is one of themost disruptive impacts of climate change already impacting the world.\n\nIn Wilmington, N.C., a coastal city of 113,000 in a state that signed the pledge, up to 82 percent of coastal flooding in the past decade isdue to human-caused climate change. In Miami, which also signed the pledge, 94 percent of coastal floods have been driven by climate change in recent years. The city recently installed a $400-million system of pumps to deal with the rising tides.\n\nHeat waves, more acidic oceans and more heavy downpours are a handful of the multitude of other impacts of climate change. All of them can disrupt society andsupply chains and come with heavy adaptation costs that will only rise if carbon pollution isn’t reined in.\n\n“The signatories understand that climate change imposes real and rising costs on America’s communities, and that the clean energy transition presents enormous economic opportunities for U.S. workers and companies,” Bob Perciasepe, the president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in a statement.\n\nYou May Also Like: New York Boardwalk Shows Climate Adaptation Costs Carbon Dioxide Set an All-Time Monthly High Fact-Checking Trump: Coal Mines Open, Prospects Bleak Trump’s Base the Big Winner from Paris Withdrawal"],[8,"London Bridge attack terror police swoop on home in Ilford in latest early morning raid","COPS carried out a series of dramatic dawn raids this morning and made their fourteenth arrest as they close in on the terror network behind the London Bridge attack.\n\nA terror gang ploughed through crowds on London Bridge before launching a stabbing attack on revellers, with seven killed in the third attack on Britain in three months.\n\nOfficers have raided a series of properties across east London with several people seen led away in handcuffs for questioning as the Met bids to stamp out any residual terror threat.\n\nGunshots, stun grenades and controlled explosions have been reported by witnesses at some of the properties cops have stormed in Newham and Barking and Dagenham.\n\nCops raided a home in Ilford at 1.30am on Tuesday and are continuing searches at the property.

although she does not currently have a seat in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Scottish Conservative leader arrived at Downing Street as SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon met her party's 35 MPs outside the Houses of Parliament.\n\nMs Sturgeon, who is Scotland's first minister, has called for a \"short pause\" in the Brexit negotiations in order to secure a cross-party, UK-wide consensus on what they hope to achieve.\n\nShe also claimed that Mrs May's plans for a so-called \"hard Brexit\" were now \"dead in the water\", and questioned whether the prime minister could form a functioning government."],[8,"Tony Blair, you threw my party to the wolves during Corbyn's general election campaign – it's time for an apology","Tony Blair and Theresa May have one thing in common: they are both obsequious lap-dogs to the tabloid press. Corbyn is no such-stick chaser. And during the seven week election campaign, Blair went to extraordinary lengths to disadvantage Corbyn, the leader of his own party. It’s high time for him to apologise.\n\nAll too often, Blair had better things to say about Theresa May than he did about Jeremy Corbyn. In April he told BBC Radio 4 that he thought May was “very sensible, very solid, she’s a perfectly decent person, I agree with a lot of what she says.” He refused to endorse Corbyn’s leadership just days before voters went to the polls, arguing that “we know who is going to be leader on June 9th” so there was no point.\n\nKensington was the icing on the cake of Corbyn’s comeback. The seat that’s never gone Labour, not even for the charms of Tony Blair, has been won by 20 votes and Jeremy Corbyn’s manifesto. Blair must now come forward and apologise unreservedly for his comments – either that or hand in his party membership and commit himself fully to Theresa May, the leader he apparently much prefers.\n\nInstead of keeping his misgivings to himself, Blair, who hasn’t been an MP since 2007, chose to interject in the middle of an election campaign, essentially to share his lack of confidence in Corbyn and to urge Labour voters to consider voting Lib Dem or Tory. In that unforgettable Radio 4 interview, he strayed dangerously close to breaching the party membership rules, which specify against endorsing other parties. Arguing for tactical voting to elect MPs opposed to a hard Brexit, Blair said: “What I’m advocating may mean that. It may mean voting Labour. It may mean, by the way, that they vote Tory, for candidates who are prepared to give this commitment.”\n\nIt’s been satisfying to see so many of Corbyn’s loudest critics from the Parliamentary Labour Party fall into line post-election, admitting they got it wrong. I agree that the party should be a broad church, capable of sheltering a diverse range of opinion and experience.\n\nI’m not arguing for mandatory reselection; it would be both unnecessary and divisive. As we know, Cobyn is an olive tree-owning olive branch offerer.  But if Lord Mandelson, Owen Smith, Chuka Umunna and more can all have the gumption to step up, hold their hands up and admit they got it wrong, then why is it unreasonable to expect an apology from Tony Blair?\n\nHaving taken just over 40 per cent of the vote, we know that Corbyn has bettered Tony Blair’s 2005 election victory. We are now faced with a chaotic and unethical Tory-DUP power share, which may or may not be led by the “dead woman” wobbling: Theresa May.\n\nAnother election looks likely and we need to force it to happen. Corbyn has already prepared his alternative Queen’s Speech and, having seen his party rise six points in the last few days (according to the latest Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday), I have every confidence that he can smash another Blairite legacy by outperforming Labour’s 1997 landslide victory. Surely Tony Blair would like to see this happen? Surely he values the performance of the party over the endurance of his own personal legacy?\n\nBlair has gone radio-silent since Corbyn defied the odds and expectations – again. Will his pride permit the apology that we all – Corbyn and every single campaigning Labour member – deserve?\n\nAs a young socialist (or “Corbynista”, in Labour factional terms) I was delighted to see our leader prove high-profile naysayers like Paul Dacre, Rupert Murdoch, Lord Mandelson, Theresa May and Tony Blair wrong. This is a hopeful, honest movement. It enrages me that a former Labour leader had the gall to act how he did towards his own party during a critical moment for the country. He needs to take responsibility before he can move forward with the rest of us. And an apology would be a good start. "]],"arguments":{},"addedWidgets":{},"removedWidgets":[],"schema":[{"name":"predictions_tfcv","type":"\"integer\"","metadata":"{}"},{"name":"title","type":"\"string\"","metadata":"{}"},{"name":"body","type":"\"string\"","metadata":"{}"}],"overflow":true,"aggData":[],"aggSchema":[],"aggOverflow":false,"aggSeriesLimitReached":false,"aggError":"","aggType":"","plotOptions":null,"isJsonSchema":true,"dbfsResultPath":null,"datasetInfos":[]},"errorSummary":"org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException:

Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris accord","AFTER announcing on June 1st that America will abandon the Paris climate agreement, Donald Trump can at least claim to have honoured a campaign promise. Then again, as he also pledged to reinstate torture, eliminate the national debt in eight years and hail Iran’s supreme leader with “Hey baby!”, that isn’t saying much. And the president’s decision to withdraw from the accord is similarly unconscionable and fatuous. A repudiation of his predecessor’s main climate policy, it was opposed by most of Mr Trump’s advisers, most large American firms and two-thirds of Americans. Mr Trump has dealt a severe blow to America’s interests and standing.\n\nMore hot air than a flue-gas stackThe Republicans who had been arguing to leave Paris, including Scott Pruitt, who disputes that people cause climate change and heads Mr Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, consider this as merely consistent with George W. Bush’s decision to exit the Kyoto protocol in 2001. Yet Mr Bush, though misguided, at least had an economic argument. Kyoto imposed binding greenhouse-gas emissions cuts on rich countries but not on fast-growing developing ones, such as China, which overtook America to become the world’s biggest polluter only six years later. \n\nThe Paris accord is different. All its signatories—which is to say, every country except Syria, Nicaragua and now America—have undertaken to reduce emissions against business-as-usual targets. By withdrawing, Mr Trump has signalled that America will neither honour its agreements nor moderate its pollution, even as governments take measures to do so in much poorer countries, such as India, whose emissions per head are a tenth the size of America’s. That is unconscionable.\n\nThe fatuous part is for Mr Trump to claim that his decision is designed to invigorate American coal mining. There is no reason to expect that it will. Miners are struggling mainly because cheap and plentiful natural gas is taking coal’s markets. Even if Mr Trump truly believes that climate-change policy is to blame, he had no need to withdraw from Paris, because America’s commitment—a 26-28% cut in its 2005 level of emissions by 2025—was so modest. America is almost halfway to meeting that target even before adopting many of the environmental strictures Barack Obama had envisaged. Had Mr Trump elected to stay in Paris, but still dismantled those putative curbs on burning coal, America might have met its target anyway. And even if it had not, it would have lost nothing but face—which is why Rex Tillerson, who was the boss of Exxon, an oil giant, before he became secretary of state, argued for staying in. \n\nWhy did Mr Trump ignore him? Perhaps because, at the G7 meeting in Sicily last month, he sensed his fellow leaders disliked him, even as they urged him not to withdraw. Or maybe because he wanted to divert attention from the scandals plaguing his White House. Those are just guesses. Yet Mr Trump has made such a mockery of diplomacy and policymaking that the world is readier to believe them than his ostensible reason for withdrawing from one of the most successful international accords of recent years.\n\nThe tragedy, as so often with Mr Trump, is that if he were only more like the pragmatic problem-solver he claims to be, he could have done some real good. Climate policy, a jerry-rigged system of subsidies and compromises, in America and everywhere, needs an overhaul. A growing number of Republicans want a revenue-neutral carbon tax. As this newspaper has long argued, that would not only be a better way of curbing pollution but also boost growth. A truly businesslike president would have explored such solutions. Mr Trump has instead chosen to abuse the health of the planet, the patience of America’s allies and the intelligence of his supporters. "],[5,"After fiery debate, he ‘stayed where he’s always been’","by Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Birnbaum\n\nThe pressure on President Trump to remain in the Paris climate accord came from all sides.\n\nSilicon Valley titans, such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, contacted the White House directly, making clear just how seriously they viewed the issue of climate change — and how important it was to them that the president not withdraw from the international pact.\n\nEuropean leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, used a private summit of the Group of Seven world powers to repeatedly and urgently prod Trump to stay true to the climate deal.\n\nAnd Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, reached out to chief executives and urged them to call her father to make their pro-business case for staying in the accord.\n\nShe even personally appealed to Andrew Liveris, the head of Dow Chemical, asking him to spearhead a letter with other CEOs — which ultimately ran as a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal in May — directly appealing to Trump to stay in the agreement, according to a person familiar with the effort.\n\nBut in the end, it was not enough.\n\nOn Thursday, in a Rose Garden ceremony, the president announced his plan to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord.\n\nTrump had never liked the Paris accord. He viewed it as a \"bad deal\" and during the campaign had promised his base he would \"cancel\" the climate pact that he believed was hurting American workers.\n\nHis final, deliberative verdict was the same as his initial, gut-level one, according to this account of Trump's decision-making process, which is based on interviews Thursday with more than a dozen administration officials, Trump confidants, Republican operatives and European diplomats. Even so, the president listened and moderated months of often heated, and at times downright contentious, discussions among his own advisers, as well as scores of outsiders.\n\nRelated: [Trump announces U.S. will exit Paris climate deal, sparking criticism at home and abroad]\n\n\"He's stayed where he's always been, and not for a lack of trying by those who have an opposite opinion,\" said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president. \"He started with a conclusion, and the evidence brought him to the same conclusion.\"\n\nNonetheless, the debate over what Trump should ultimately do — stay in the deal to push for changes or fully pull out — roiled the administration.\n\nThe fight pitted Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and White House Counsel Don McGahn — who all pushed for a total withdrawal — against Ivanka Trump, economic chief Gary Cohn and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — who argued that the president would have more leverage by remaining an active participant in the climate deal.\n\nDuring meetings with the president, Bannon, Pruitt and their allies came armed with reams of documents filled with numbers and statistics showing what they said would be the negative effects on the U.S. economy if the United States remained in the climate deal. They were, in the words of one Republican in frequent contact with the White House, \"ready to go to trial.\"\n\n\"They were presenting facts and figures,\" Conway said. \"They were really important. That was the evidentiary case.\"\n\nSome of those opposed to pulling out of the pact, however, said that much of the data the other side presented was either erroneous, scientifically dubious, misleading or out of date.\n\nThe Paris pact was a particular passion for Bannon, who spent the past two weeks consumed by the climate deal, including working feverishly from the West Wing after returning early from Trump's foreign trip, according to two White House officials familiar with the discussions. He pressed his case directly with the president — arguing that the Paris accord was a product of globalism and unpopular with Trump's base — and also worked with Pruitt to tilt the talks in that direction, providing political ballast to the policy and legal arguments made by others on his side.\n\nIvanka Trump, meanwhile, helped lead the effort to stay in the deal. In meetings, she argued that withdrawing could hurt the United States' global image and weaken its moral authority abroad. She and her allies pushed the case that the president would have more leverage if he remained part of the agreement and negotiated from within.\n\nThe opposing camp, however, dismissed the substance of her appeal, brushing off her concerns as a hand-wringing question: \"What will the world think of us?\"\n\nShe also understood she might not be successful in swaying her father. But she helped implement a process in which Trump heard voices from all perspectives, from both inside and outside the administration.\n\nJared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and Ivanka's husband, agreed with the president that the Paris agreement was a bad deal. He felt that the carbon emissions standards were too high and that a U.N. fund that helps developing countries counter climate change was costing the United States too much. But he, too, felt Trump should not withdraw but simply renegotiate better terms.\n\nAnother, smaller contingent tried for an outside-the-box fix: Marc Short, Trump's director of legislative affairs, argued that the climate pact could be considered a treaty, in which case the president should send it to the Senate, which would need to ratify it by a two-thirds majority. Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Nick Ayers, a senior strategist for Vice President Pence, both supported the idea. But it never gained much traction because the agreement was specifically crafted as an agreement that did not need Senate ratification.\n\nRelated: [These titans of industry just broke with Trump’s decision to exit the Paris accords]\n\nSome of the efforts to dissuade Trump from withdrawing actually had the reverse effect, further entrenching his original position. When Trump heard advocates arguing that the era of coal was coming to an end — something Cohn told reporters on last week's foreign trip and also a frequent talking point by some cable news pundits — Trump only became more adamant that pulling out of the Paris pact could help rescue the U.S. coal industry, said a Republican operative in close contact with the White House.\n\n\"When he hears people make comments like 'Coal jobs don't matter anymore' or 'Those are going away,' he thinks of all those people who got the election wrong and didn't realize that, no, these people are important to us,\" the operative said. \"That's when his populist message kicks in. It pushes him.\"\n\nPressure from leaders abroad also backfired. One senior White House official characterized disappointing European allies as \"a secondary benefit\" of Trump's decision to withdraw.\n\nWhen Trump touched down at a humid Sicilian air base last week, European leaders were already girding up for an argument at the G-7 summit. In Brussels, the president had just castigated NATO allies for their defense spending. But as leaders spoke during a closed-door NATO dinner, not one directly confronted him, seeking to save their political capital for a contentious discussion about climate change in Italy.\n\nIn the end, several officials said, the Group of Seven summit felt more like a Group of Six against One, at least on climate issues, as every other leader went around the table urging Trump to remain in the Paris accord.\n\n\"There is a situation where six — if you take the E.U., seven — stand against one,\" Merkel said after the meeting.\n\nMerkel, who might be the ­second-most powerful leader in the world after Trump, also pressed a moral-based argument, according to one official who was in the room. If the United States pulled out, what would be the message to countries in Africa that could suffer most from global warming and nations like Fiji that are drowning under rising sea levels?\n\nThe official added that another leader brought up political arguments: Does the United States want to preserve the U.S. lead on the topic or hand it off to China and India? And a third made an economic pitch: By encouraging renewable energy, you boost the economy, you boost innovation and you stay competitive.\n\nBut Trump seemed unmoved by any of the appeals, instead telling the group that this was what he had promised during his election campaign and that he was protecting his voters, according to the official.\n\nOn the plane back from Sicily, Merkel did little to hide her disappointment, according to someone who traveled with her. She raved about Macron and his \"keen perception.\" There was no such praise for Trump, of whom she could only say, \"He listened for hours.\"\n\nThe Europeans were hardly the only ones upset by the president's decision. Among administration aides who wanted Trump to stay in the agreement, there was growing frustration, bordering on despondency, that they had been unsuccessful in their effort.\n\nMany had given up high-paying jobs outside the administration, sacrificed their quality of life, and were facing daily leaks and palace intrigue stories — only to feel as if they had been unable to influence the president on an issue of top importance.\n\nBut the president's mind was largely made up: He would withdraw from the Paris accord.\n\nIf he needed a nudge, though, one came from France over the weekend. Macron was quoted in a French journal talking about his white-knuckled handshake with Trump at their first meeting in Brussels, where the newly elected French president gripped Trump's hand tightly and would not let go for six long seconds in a show of alpha-male fortitude.\n\n\"My handshake was not innocent,\" Macron said. He likened Trump to a pair of authoritarian strongmen — Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — and said that he was purposefully forceful because he believed his encounter with Trump was \"a moment of truth.\"\n\nHearing smack-talk from the Frenchman 31 years his junior irritated and bewildered Trump, aides said.\n\nA few days later, Trump got his revenge. He proclaimed from the Rose Garden, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\"\n\nBirnbaum reported from Brussels.

To date, Eric Trump has raised more than $11 million — including $2.9 million last year — for the hospital's research, most of it through the golf tournaments, according to Forbes.\n\nThe costs for the tournaments averaged $50,000 during the first four years, which is about what other charities pay for events at Trump courses. But the expenses quickly began to rise, reaching $322,000 by 2015, Forbes reported, citing IRS filings.\n\nIf accurate, these figures are hard to reconcile with Eric Trump's claims that the charity is able to use the course for free and that many other expenses are donated. \"We get to use our assets 100% free of charge,\" the president's son told Forbes.\n\n\"In reviewing filings from the Eric Trump Foundation and other charities, it's clear that the course wasn't free — that the Trump Organization received payments for its use, part of more than $1.2 million that has no documented recipients past the Trump Organization,\" Forbes reported. \"Golf charity experts say the listed expenses defy any reasonable cost justification for a one-day golf tournament.\"\n\nRead more: \n\nIn addition, more than $500,000 in donations were given to other charities, \"many of which were connected to Trump family members or interests, including at least four groups that subsequently paid to hold golf tournaments at Trump courses,\" the magazine reported.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the spike in costs for the tournament started in 2011 when Donald Trump insisted the charity begin paying the Trump Organization for the events.\n\nIan Gillule, who worked as a membership and marketing director at the Westchester course, told Forbes that Donald Trump was not happy with the expenses the charity wasn't being billed for.\n\n\"Mr. Trump had a cow,\" Forbes quoted Gillule as saying. \"He flipped. He was like, 'We're donating all of this stuff, and there's no paper trail? No credit?' And he went nuts. He said, 'I don't care if it's my son or not — everybody gets billed.'\"\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation gave $100,000 to the Eric Trump Foundation to help offset the increase in costs, Gillule told Forbes. That means donors to the Donald J. Trump Foundation — the Trump family had not given money to that foundation for several years — saw $100,000 of their donations pass on as revenue to the Trump Organization by way of charges to the Eric Trump Foundation.\n\nEric Trump announced he would stop fundraising in December and is now acting as co-head of the Trump Organization during his father's presidency. The Eric Trump Foundation changed its name to Curetivity and plans to continue to hold charity golf events for St. Jude, Forbes reported."],[5,"Two moderate Senate Republicans suggest the need to consider a special prosecutor","Two moderate Republicans, one of whom is a member of the Senate committee investigating Trump’s campaign ties to Russia, raised the possibility of tapping a special prosecutor to continue the FBI investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election Wednesday.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a member of the Senate intelligence committee, told NPR that she believes Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein should make that determinationnow. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said in a statement posted on social media that a special prosecutor or independent commission may be necessary for lawmakers, the FBI and President Trump’s administration “to restore the public’s trust.”\n\n“I believe there are sufficient allegations out there — regrettably many of them from anonymous sources — that the Department of Justice should take a look at this,” said Collins, who earlier didn’t support the idea of an independent investigation.\n\nBoth senators, however, shied away from echoing their Democratic colleagues’ more aggressive demand for a special prosecutor and seem to only suggest the possibility. Both also maintained that the ongoing congressional inquiries into possible Russian interference in the election should move forward.\n\nCollins told NPR that three questions need to be answered in deciding whether a special prosecutor is warranted.\n\n“One, is there going to be a criminal investigation? Second, does the Department of Justice have a conflict of interest or are there other extraordinary circumstances? Third, is it in the public interest?” Collins said.\n\nCollins suggested completing the congressional committee’s broader inquiry into Russia and the Trump campaign and then having the Senate Intelligence Committee recommend an independent counsel to be appointed.\n\nAsked whether she wants to hear from Trump, Collins said the president should issue a statement “far more thoroughly explaining his actions.”\n\nBut, she added, the key person she wants to hear from right now is former FBI director James Comey.\n\nSen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va), chairman and vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, respectively, have both called for Comey’s appearance before the committee in both open and closed sessions.\n\nAfter Comey’s abrupt firing, a chorus of Democrats demanded that a special prosecutor take over the investigation Comey was heading. But most Republicans, who are in control of both the House and the Senate, don’t support an independent inquiry, although many of them are unhappy about Comey’s abrupt dismissal."],[5,"As Trump fiddles on climate, the world goes Californian","Trump's FBI pick wants to lead independent bureau that will \"make every American proud\" Christopher A.

Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications.\n\nThe meeting also was attended by Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser.\n\nThe White House disclosed the meeting only in March, playing down its significance. But people familiar with the matter say the FBI now considers the encounter, as well as another meeting Kushner had with a Russian banker, to be of investigative interest.\n\nKislyak reportedly was taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate — a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team.\n\nNeither the meeting nor the communications of Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, declined to comment. The Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRussia at times feeds false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U.S. analysts. But officials said that it’s unclear what Kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with Kushner to Moscow, particularly at a time when the Kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improved relations with Trump.\n\nKushner’s apparent interest in establishing a secret channel with Moscow, rather than relying on U.S. government systems, has added to the intrigue surrounding the Trump administration’s relationship with Russia.\n\nTo some officials, it also reflects a staggering naivete.\n\nThe FBI closely monitors the communications of Russian officials in the United States, and it maintains a nearly constant surveillance of its diplomatic facilities. The National Security Agency monitors the communications of Russian officials overseas.\n\nCurrent and former U.S. intelligence officials said that although Russian diplomats have secure means of communicating with Moscow, Kushner’s apparent request for access to such channels was extraordinary.\n\n“How would he trust that the Russians wouldn’t leak it on their side?” said one former senior intelligence official. The FBI would know that a Trump transition official was going in and out of the embassy, which would cause “a great deal” of concern, he added. The entire idea, he said, “seems extremely naive or absolutely crazy.”\n\nThe discussion of a secret channel adds to a broader pattern of efforts by Trump’s closest advisers to obscure their contacts with Russian counterparts. Trump’s first national security adviser, Flynn, was forced to resign after a series of false statements about his conversations with Kislyak. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from matters related to the Russia investigation after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose his own meetings with Kislyak when asked during congressional testimony about any contact with Russians.\n\nKushner’s interactions with Russians — including Kislyak and an executive for a Russian bank under U.S. sanctions — were not acknowledged by the White House until they were exposed in media reports.\n\nIt is common for senior advisers of a newly elected president to be in contact with foreign leaders and officials. But new administrations are generally cautious in their handling of interactions with Moscow, which U.S. intelligence agencies have accused of waging an unprecedented campaign to interfere in last year’s presidential race and help elect Trump.\n\nObama administration officials say members of the Trump transition team never approached them about arranging a secure communications channel with their Russian contacts, possibly because of concerns about leaks.\n\nThe State Department, the White House National Security Council and U.S. intelligence agencies all have the ability to set up secure communications channels with foreign leaders, though doing so for a transition team would be unusual.\n\nTrump’s advisers were similarly secretive about meetings with leaders from the United Arab Emirates. The Obama White House only learned that the crown prince of Abu Dhabi was flying to New York in December to see Kushner, Flynn and Stephen K. Bannon, another top Trump adviser, because U.S. border agents in the UAE spotted the Emirate leader’s name on a flight manifest.\n\nRussia would also have had reasons of its own to reject such an overture from Kushner. Doing so would require Moscow to expose its most sophisticated communications capabilities — which are likely housed in highly secure locations at diplomatic compounds — to an American.\n\nThe Post was first alerted in mid-December to the meeting by an anonymous letter, which said, among other things, that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel. This week, officials who reviewed the letter and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence said the portion about the secret channel was consistent with their understanding of events.\n\nFor instance, according to those officials and the letter, Kushner conveyed to the Russians that he was aware that it would be politically sensitive to meet publicly, but it was necessary for the Trump team to be able to continue their communication with Russian government officials.\n\nIn addition to their discussion about setting up the communications channel, Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a “Russian contact” in a third country whose name was not identified, according to the anonymous letter.\n\nThe Post reported in April that Erik Prince, the founder of the private security firm Blackwater, now called Academi, and an informal adviser to the Trump transition team,met on Jan. 11 — nine days before Trump’s inauguration — in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean with a representative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRead more:"],[5,"Impeachment gains ground in new poll","Polling this week has not been a friend to Donald Trump, which will be news to him given how terrific all his aides say he is doing. \n\nIn a Politico pollreleased Wednesday, support for impeaching Trump ticked up to 43 percent, a five-point gain from the same poll just last week—though 45 percent of respondents still oppose impeachment.\n\nAnother Wednesday poll found Trump's support softening in Michigan, one of the three states that helped tilt the Electoral College in Trump's favor by a very slim margin of some 70,000 votes.\n\nThe poll shows that, since the last poll by EPIC-MRA in February, Trump’s job approval rating — which is different from his favorability score — has fallen substantially. Sixty-one percent of those surveyed gave Trump a negative job rating — up five percentage points from February. That matched the increase from 50% to 55% of Michiganders who believe the direction of the country has taken a “wrong turn,” according to the poll. \n\nTrump's job approval ratings among Michiganders fell to just 12 percent (ouch!), down from an already embarrassing 18 percent."],[5,"France's Emmanuel Macron: Birth of the anti-Trump?","Emmanuel Macron has just won the rare distinction of being the most re-tweeted French person in history.\n\nIn less than 24 hours, his Trump-defying message \"make our planet great again\" was shared more than 140,000 times, easily ousting the previous record-holder, the rather less high-minded TV presenter Cyril Hanouna. One fifth of the re-tweets were in the US.\n\nIt is proof yet again that what we witnessed from the Elysee on Thursday was a master class in communications.\n\nIn giving his TV reaction to the US president, not only did Macron break brazenly with longstanding convention, according to which French presidents never speak publicly in English, but he even had the chutzpah to subvert the US leader's personal campaign slogan.\n\n\"Make our planet great again\" was a provocation dressed up as a call to virtue. As a catchphrase for the faithful, it was irresistible.\n\nBy tweeting it, Macron took one more step down his road to investiture as that long-awaited international figure: the anti-Trump.\n\nThe French leader has a growing fan club: in France, the US and across the globe, among people who see him as the polar opposite, the perfect antithesis of his counterpart in the White House.\n\nThese people love the fact that with the arrival of Macron, the existing order appears to have been turned on its head.\n\nIt used to be France that was old, inward-looking and incapable of regeneration, and America that was the land of youth, energy and leadership.\n\nBut where is that caricature now?\n\nAnd they adore the way that Macron had the nerve to face down Trump in the Brussels handshake. At last, they feel, we have a champion with the guts and the conviction to challenge the Trumpian order.\n\nMacron himself never planned any of this. When he first thought of running for the presidency, the chances of a Trump in the White House seemed too ludicrous to contemplate.\n\nBut not for the first time, the stars seem to have aligned for France's boy-prodigy.\n\nJust as in domestic politics doors seemed to open miraculously for President Macron, so in the world of international affairs shifts of power and ideology are also working in his favour - for now.\n\nThe tilt towards nationalist interests exemplified by Trump's America has created a clear leadership space for someone who will fly the other flag. Providential or not, Macron has come to power just as a reaction sets in against the populist tide of the last few years - and he is poised to reap the reward.\n\nWith its perpetual harping on about ideals and morals, France's capacity to irritate is prodigious. Perhaps it will not be long before Macron loses his touch and the world starts panting for his comeuppance.\n\nBut right now, with Trump in the White House, French preachiness doesn't appear to raise as many heckles as it used to. Having a quotable charmer for a president certainly helps."],[5,"Trump Twitter blocks lead to constitutionality question","The lawyers of two Twitter users whose accounts were blocked by President Donald Trump are demanding Trump unblock their clients, accusing the president of violating their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe @realDonaldTrump account blocked the two users this year after they posted tweets mocking and criticizing the president, the lawyers say.\n\n\"This Twitter account operates as a 'designated public forum' for First Amendment purposes, and accordingly the viewpoint-based blocking of our clients is unconstitutional,\" the nonprofit Knight First Amendment Institute wrote in a letter to Trump on Tuesday. \n\n\"We ask that you unblock them and any others who have been blocked for similar reasons,\" it said.\n\nOne of the users cited in the letter, Holly O'Reilly, had her account blocked after posting a series of replies to one of Trump's tweets last month, according to the letter.\n\nIn one tweet, she promoted the March for Truth, an anti-Trump protest she said she helped organize. In another, she posted a GIF of Pope Francis appearing uncomfortable standing next to Trump, with the caption, \"This is pretty much how the whole world sees you.\"\n\nThe other user, Joe Papp, was blocked for a tweet of his that contained the hashtag \"#fakeleader,\" the institute said.\n\nIn a statement, Knight Institute executive director Jameel Jaffer acknowledged the uncharted legal territory his letter was entering.\n\n\"Though the architects of the Constitution surely didn’t contemplate presidential Twitter accounts, they understood that the President must not be allowed to banish views from public discourse simply because he finds them objectionable,\" Jaffer said.\n\n\"Having opened this forum to all comers, the President can’t exclude people from it merely because he dislikes what they’re saying.\"\n\nWhether the Knight Institute's argument would stand a chance in court is a matter for debate — and First Amendment attorneys are split on the issue.\n\nPart of the issue hinges on whether Trump's personal social media account amounts to a government-designated public forum, like an open city-hall meeting. The Knight Institute said in its letter that its arguments also apply to the president's official @POTUS account.\n\n\"Frankly, I think that's somewhat of an open question that needs to be resolved by the courts,\" First Amendment lawyer Lisa Zycherman of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP told Business Insider.\n\n\"Once you become an elected official, your social media account is by an extension a forum for your constituents to engage with you,\" she said.\n\nBut Marc Randazza, a First Amendment lawyer with the Randazza Legal Group, said a president's social media account isn't a public forum, making the Knight Institute's argument meritless.\n\n\"I'm very expansionist when it comes to First Amendment rights,\" Randazza told Business Insider. \"But this is a little bit of an overreach to say it's a First Amendment violation to block a critic on Twitter.\"\n\nRandazza also countered the comparison of Trump's Twitter account to a town hall, opting for a different metaphor for the president's actions.\n\n\"If somebody was talking to him and he stuck his fingers in his ears and said, 'La la la, I'm not listening to you,' that's not a First Amendment violation either,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't have a right to be listened to. You have a right to speak,\" he said.\n\nIn a message to the Wall Street Journal, Ken Paulson, dean of media and entertainment at Middle Tennessee State University, called the Knight Institute's argument \"novel and ambitious,\" but admitted it was \"a tough sell\" legally.\n\n\"I do think municipalities that establish Facebook pages and invite citizen input are in fact establishing public forums, but I’m not sure that Donald Trump’s brief bursts of opinion are the same thing,\" he said, according to The Journal."],[5,"Trump Accidentally Records Over Comey Meeting Tape With Idea For Candy Hotel","WASHINGTON—Brainstorming the wondrous features and amenities as they came to him in a flash of inspiration, President Donald Trump on Wednesday accidentally recorded over the tape containing his meetings with fired FBI Director James Comey with an idea for a candy hotel. “There could be a revolving door made out of peppermint swirl, and then you walk in, and there’s a giant lobby with chocolate fountains, peanut brittle columns, and beautiful rock candy chandeliers,” said Trump into a handheld cassette recorder, replacing over 90 minutes of crucially important conversations that could be used as key evidence in determining whether obstruction of justice occurred with musings about a gumdrop garden and olympic-sized pudding pool. “The ballroom could have a hard caramel floor with ornate wall designs carved into stucco made from nougat, and then red taffy curtains and a Jolly Rancher piano—oh, and all the beds would be made out of marshmallow, and the sheets could be cotton candy.” After realizing his mistake, Trump reportedly became paranoid that if the FBI got access to the tapes, they could steal his idea."],[5,"Trump Unpopular Worldwide, American Image Suffers","America still wins praise for its people, culture and civil liberties\n\nAlthough he has only been in office a few months, Donald Trump’s presidency has had a major impact on how the world sees the United States. Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe, and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations. According to a new Pew Research Center survey spanning 37 nations, a median of just 22% has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. This stands in contrast to the final years of Barack Obama’s presidency, when a median of 64% expressed confidence in Trump’s predecessor to direct America’s role in the world.\n\nThe sharp decline in how much global publics trust the U.S. president on the world stage is especially pronounced among some of America’s closest allies in Europe and Asia, as well as neighboring Mexico and Canada. Across the 37 nations polled, Trump gets higher marks than Obama in only two countries: Russia and Israel.\n\nIn countries where confidence in the U.S. president fell most, America’s overall image has also tended to suffer more. In the closing years of the Obama presidency, a median of 64% had a positive view of the U.S. Today, just 49% are favorably inclined toward America. Again, some of the steepest declines in U.S. image are found among long-standing allies.\n\nSince 2002, when Pew Research Center first asked about America’s image abroad, favorable opinion of the U.S. has frequently tracked with confidence in the country’s president. Prior to this spring, one of the biggest shifts in attitudes toward the U.S. occurred with the change from George W. Bush’s administration to Obama’s. At that time, positive views of the U.S. climbed in Europe and other regions, as did trust in how the new president would handle world affairs.\n\nEven though the 2017 shift in views of the U.S. and its president is in the opposite direction compared with eight years ago, publics on balance are not necessarily convinced that this will affect bilateral relations with the U.S. The prevailing view among the 37 countries surveyed is that their country’s relationship with the U.S. will be unchanged over the next few years. Among those who do anticipate a change, however, more predict relations will worsen, rather than improve.\n\nConfidence in President Trump is influenced by reactions to both his policies and his character. With regard to the former, some of his signature policy initiatives are widely opposed around the globe.\n\nHis plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, for example, is opposed by a median of 76% across the 37 countries surveyed. Opposition is especially intense in Mexico, where more than nine-in-ten (94%) oppose the U.S. government erecting a wall.\n\nSimilar levels of global opposition greet Trump’s policy stances on withdrawing from international trade agreements and climate change accords. And most across the nations surveyed also disapprove of the new administration’s efforts to restrict entry into the U.S. by people from certain Muslim-majority nations.\n\nTrump’s intention to back away from the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran meets less opposition than his other policy initiatives, but even here publics around the world disapprove of such an action by a wide margin.\n\nTrump’s character is also a factor in how he is viewed abroad. In the eyes of most people surveyed around the world, the White House’s new occupant is arrogant, intolerant and even dangerous. Among the positive characteristics tested, his highest rating is for being a strong leader. Fewer believe he is charismatic, well-qualified or cares about ordinary people.\n\nWhile the new U.S. president is viewed with doubt and apprehension in many countries, America’s overall image benefits from a substantial reservoir of goodwill. The American people, for instance, continue to be well-regarded – across the 37 nations polled, a median of 58% say they have a favorable opinion of Americans. U.S. popular culture, likewise, has maintained appeal abroad, and many people overseas still believe Washington respects the personal freedoms of its people.\n\nThese are among the major findings from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted among 40,448 respondents in 37 countries outside the U.S. from Feb. 16 to May 8, 2017.\n\nThe drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread. The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Favorability ratings have only increased in Russia and Vietnam.\n\nAs Pew Research Center’s global surveys from George W. Bush’s presidency illustrated, many of Bush’s key foreign policies were unpopular, and by the time he left office Bush was viewed negatively in most of the countries we polled. His successor, Obama, generally received more positive ratings throughout his White House tenure.\n\nToday, in many countries, ratings for President Trump look very similar to those for Bush at the end of his term. This pattern is especially clear in Western Europe. In the UK, France, Germany and Spain, the low levels of confidence in Trump are very similar to the poor ratings for Bush in 2008.\n\nIn addition to exploring global views of President Trump, this survey also examines attitudes toward three other major leaders on the international stage. The results demonstrate that Trump is not the only world leader in whom global publics lack confidence. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin also get poor marks, though neither is rated as negatively as the U.S. president. Across the 37 nations surveyed, a median of 28% voice confidence in Xi, while 27% feel this way about Putin.\n\nIn contrast, 42% express confidence in the long-serving German Chancellor Angela Merkel, while just 31% lack confidence in her. A median of 60% in Europe have confidence in Merkel, and her ratings are particularly strong on the political left, even though she hails from the right-of-center Christian Democratic Union (CDU).\n\nXi and Merkel are somewhat less well-known than Trump and Putin. Roughly one-in-five globally do not offer an opinion about the Chinese and German leaders.\n\nThe 2017 survey examines attitudes toward five major policy proposals that President Trump has supported. Globally, none of them are popular.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump repeatedly pledged to withdraw the U.S. from the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, though he has yet to do so as president. On balance, global publics oppose this idea. Only in Israel and Jordan do majorities support U.S. withdrawal from the agreement.\n\nAbout a third globally express support for Trump’s proposed ban on people entering the U.S. from certain Muslim-majority nations, although there are four countries – Hungary, Israel, Poland and Russia – where more than half endorse this proposal. Opposition is especially strong in several countries with Muslim-majority populations, including Jordan, Lebanon and Senegal.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted before Trump officially announced that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris climate change accord, finds widespread opposition to the U.S. withdrawing from international climate change agreements. A median of only 19% support the U.S. backing away from accords like the one signed in Paris – similar to the low level of support for the U.S. rejecting major trade agreements. (Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal early in his administration.) Opposition to the U.S. withdrawing from climate and trade agreements is especially strong in the European nations polled.\n\nA median of just 16% endorse Trump’s plan to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Fully 94% of Mexicans oppose the wall, and the wall is strongly rejected throughout Latin America, as well as in much of Europe. There is no country among the 37 surveyed in which a majority endorses a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nSurvey respondents were read a list of positive and negative characteristics, and for each one, were asked whether it describes Donald Trump. Around the globe, people associate a number of negative characteristics with the U.S. leader. Most say he is arrogant, intolerant and dangerous, while few think of him as well-qualified or as someone who cares about ordinary people. Describing Trump as charismatic is more common, although global publics on balance do not think of him as charismatic either. They do, however, see Trump as a strong leader – a median of 55% across the nations polled describe him this way.\n\nAttitudes toward the U.S. president and American foreign policy have a major impact on how people around the world view the United States, but other factors are important too. The nation’s culture, ideas and people – elements of what is sometimes referred to as “soft power” – also shape how people around the world see the country. In this poll, as in previous Pew Research Center surveys, some aspects of American soft power have stronger global appeal than others.\n\nThe American people are core to how the U.S. is perceived around the globe. Overall, Americans are seen more positively than the U.S. as a country. Across the nations polled, a median of 58% say they have a favorable impression of Americans. Positive views are especially common in Asia and Europe. They are less common, however, in the Middle East – Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon are the only nations polled where majorities express an unfavorable opinion of Americans.\n\nAlong with its citizens, America’s popular culture is often well-regarded abroad. Roughly two-thirds across the countries surveyed like American music, movies and television. Europeans and Asians are particularly likely to find U.S. pop culture appealing, while these types of cultural exports are less popular in several Muslim-majority nations.\n\nDespite the doubts sown several years ago by revelations of American spying on foreign leaders and citizens, across the 37 countries polled this spring a median of 54% believe the U.S. government respects the personal freedom of its people. In Europe, America’s reputation for individual liberty was damaged by the U.S. National Security Agency’s spying revelations and has not recovered – today, a median of 52% across the 10 European nations polled say Washington respects personal freedoms, while nearly as many (a median of 44%) say it does not. The U.S. gets higher marks on this issue in Asia and Africa.\n\nBut America’s influence around the world is not always welcome. For example, even though many people say they personally like American popular culture, a global median of 54% worry that the influx of U.S. customs and ideas into their country is a bad thing.\n\nA U.S. export that not all publics embrace is American-style democracy. While publics around the world generally endorse broad democratic principles, they offer mixed views regarding American ideas about democracy: Globally, a median of 43% say they like these ideas, while 46% say they dislike them. As with several other aspects of U.S. soft power, U.S.-style democracy is particularly popular in the African and Asian nations surveyed.\n\nRespondents were asked whether, now that Trump is president, they think relations between their country and the U.S. will improve over the next few years, get worse, or stay about the same.\n\nIn many countries, a majority or plurality believes relations will remain about the same. However, in most regions of the world, the share of the public that believes things will worsen outweighs the share that thinks relations will improve by a ratio of two-to-one. While relatively few say they expect relations to improve, more than half hold this view in Russia and Israel.\n\nLooking at findings on U.S. favorability and confidence in the American president in Russia, Israel, Germany, Mexico and Canada illustrates different patterns Pew Research Center surveys have discovered over time regarding attitudes toward the U.S. and its leader.\n\nRussia: U.S. favorability is up and Trump is relatively popular\n\nAmid ongoing controversies and investigations into allegations of links between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, attitudes toward the U.S. have turned more positive in Russia. Following the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis in 2014, ratings for both the U.S. as a country and for President Obama plummeted. However, since 2015 – the last time the Center polled in Russia – favorable opinions of the U.S. have become much more common there. And President Trump gets more-positive reviews in Russia than either of his predecessors ever did.\n\nIsrael: Consistently positive about U.S., but views of U.S. presidents have varied\n\nIn survey after survey, Israelis give the U.S. some of its highest favorability ratings, and that’s true again this year, with 81% saying they have a positive view of the U.S. Assessments of American presidents, however, have fluctuated. In 2003, President George W. Bush received very high ratings, but those declined a bit over the course of his presidency. Obama’s confidence ratings varied from 49% to 71% in the Center’s polling in Israel during his administration. Between 2014 and 2015, his ratings dipped substantially, reflecting tensions between Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Iran nuclear deal. Israel is one of only two countries (Russia being the other) in which Trump’s ratings are higher than Obama’s during the final two years of his administration.\n\nGermany: Dramatic shift in views of American president, U.S. favorability drops\n\nIn Germany – and in several of its Western European neighbors – attitudes toward the U.S. have followed a clear pattern over the past decade and a half. President George W. Bush was not very popular at the outset of his presidency, and he grew less so over the next few years, amid widespread German opposition to key elements of his foreign policy. This in turn had a negative impact on America’s overall image in the country. President Obama, in contrast, was extremely well-regarded (although his ratings did decline somewhat following the NSA eavesdropping scandal), and this coincided with an improvement in attitudes toward the U.S. Today, German confidence in Trump is low, and U.S. favorability is near where it was at the end of the Bush years.\n\nMexico and Canada: Ratings plunge among America’s closest neighbors\n\nAmerica’s image has turned negative in the two nations with which it shares a border.\n\nOver the past decade, U.S. presidents have gotten mixed or negative reviews in Mexico, but at 5% Donald Trump registers the lowest confidence rating of any U.S. leader in Mexico since Pew Research Center began surveying there. This 5% rating is also the lowest among the 37 nations polled in 2017. The proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico has been a high-profile position for Trump since he declared his candidacy for president, and more than nine-in-ten Mexicans oppose it. U.S. favorability has typically been higher than confidence in the American president in Mexico. That remains the case this year, although the share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has dropped steeply since 2015.\n\nTrump receives dramatically lower ratings than his predecessor in Canada. And for the first time since the Center began polling in Canada, the share of Canadians expressing a favorable opinion of their neighbor to the south has slipped to below 50%. Just 43% of Canadians now have a positive view of the U.S."],[5,"House Intelligence Panel Issues Seven Subpoenas as Russia Probe Ramps Up","WASHINGTON—The House Intelligence Committee issued seven subpoenas on Wednesday, in a sign that its investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election is advancing in scope and intensity, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Republican-led committee issued four subpoenas related to the Russia investigation, targeting President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser Mike Flynn, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, and their businesses. The committee is also investigating possible ties between Trump associates and Russia.\n\nThe other three subpoenas were issued to the National Security Agency, the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency for information about a procedure known as “unmasking.” The subpoenas are related to questions about how and why the names of the president’s associates were unredacted and distributed within classified reports by Obama administration officials during the transition between administrations.\n\nWednesday’s requests were the first subpoenas issued by the House committee in the Russia probe so far and showcase the continuing divide within the committee over the direction of the probe. Democrats are seeking an aggressive investigation into Mr. Trump and his associates, and Republicans are pushing for a probe into the unmasking.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted early Thursday: “The big story is the ‘unmasking and surveillance’ of people that took place during the Obama Administration.”\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee also is examining suspected Russian involvement in last year’s campaign. That panel is expected to hear testimony as early as next week from former FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the agency’s Russia investigation until Mr. Trump fired him on May 9. Russia has denied interfering with the election and Mr. Trump has denied that his associates colluded with the Russian government.\n\nMr. Comey is expected to testify Mr. Trump asked him to back off the investigation of Mr. Flynn, according to a person familiar with the matter. The panel’s request for Mr. Comey’s testimony was sparked by his abrupt dismissal by Mr. Trump and allegations that Mr. Trump may have been trying to interfere in the continuing investigation. The president has denied the allegations. Mr. Flynn was forced to resign in February after misleading senior White House officials about his conversations in December with the Russian ambassador.\n\nThe probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation is now headed by former agency director Robert Mueller, who was tapped by the Justice Department to serve as a special counsel.\n\nThe House investigation suffered a setback when its Republican chairman Devin Nunes was forced to step aside in April after an ethics complaint was filed over his handling of classified materials. Mr. Nunes remains the chairman of the committee but recused himself from the Russia inquiry.\n\nMr. Nunes signed all seven subpoenas despite his recusal, according to people familiar with the matter. A GOP congressional aide said that the unmasking investigation was now considered separate from the Russia probe, allowing Mr. Nunes to act on his own authority even while recused.\n\nDemocrats on the committee criticized the move, saying they didn’t consent to the unmasking subpoenas. “This action would have been taken without the minority’s agreement. Any prior requests for information would have been undertaken without the minority’s knowledge,” said a senior Democratic committee aide.\n\nDemocrats are seeking an aggressive probe of Mr. Trump and his associates, including questions about whether they had any contact with Russian agents.\n\nRepublicans on the committee are pushing for an investigation of how the names of Trump campaign officials became exposed in classified intelligence reports based off intelligence community intercepts, as well as questions about how classified information about Mr. Trump’s associates was given to the media.\n\nMr. Nunes first raised the issue of unmasking in March based on information he received from the White House.\n\nTypically, information about Americans intercepted in foreign surveillance is redacted, even in classified reports distributed within the government, unless a compelling need exists to reveal or “unmask” them. Unmasking requests aren’t uncommon by top intelligence community officials but Republicans want to know whether any of the unmaskings of Trump campaign officials during the transition were politically motivated.\n\nThe most recent subpoenas to the intelligence agencies seek information on any requests made by former national security adviser Susan Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan and former United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power for names to be unmasked in classified material. The three didn’t personally receive subpoenas, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMr. Brennan, Ms. Rice and Ms. Power didn’t respond to requests for comment. Ms. Rice in April told CNN she never did anything “untoward” with intelligence collected on American citizens, including Trump aides working on the transition.\n\nMs. Power hasn’t previously been reported as a potential witness in the probe so her inclusion in the subpoenas may mean Republicans are broadening their areas of investigation.\n\nUnmasking is typically restricted to high-level officials to safeguard the privacy of Americans caught up in U.S. government spy operations directed at foreign targets. Typically, only top officials within the intelligence agencies and the administration have the ability to ask for unmasking, which is approved by the agency that controls the information.\n\nOfficials have acknowledged the names of some Trump aides were revealed in the classified documents, and Republicans have questioned whether it might have been improper.\n\nThe four subpoenas related to the Russia investigation are aimed at Mr. Flynn and his business Flynn Intel Group LLC, as well as Mr. Cohen, a former Trump Organization attorney, and his law firm. “If subpoenaed, I will work with my lawyers to cooperate with the various investigations,” Mr. Cohen said. An attorney for Mr. Flynn didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nBoth have declined to voluntarily cooperate with the probe but Mr. Flynn is complying with a Senate subpoena for his business records.\n\nThe House panel also recently sent a letter to former White House press aide Boris Epshteyn asking him to voluntarily submit information to the committee. Mr. Epshteyn briefly served as special assistant to the president in the Trump administration before departing his post earlier this year. A lawyer for Mr. Epshteyn made the request public on Wednesday.\n\n“Like many others, Mr. Epshteyn has received a broad, preliminary request for information from the House Intelligence Committee,” an attorney for Mr. Epshteyn said Wednesday.\n\nHe added: “This is a voluntary request. Mr. Epshteyn has not been subpoenaed nor do we anticipate that he will be. We have reached out to the committee with several follow up questions and we are awaiting their response in order to better understand what information they are seeking and whether Mr. Epshteyn is able to reasonably provide it.”\n\n—Shelby Holliday, Carol E.

Mr Trump came under huge criticism last week when he fired Mr Comey whose agents are investigating Russian interference in the US election and alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. \n\nThe emergence of the memo, which was disclosed by the New York Times, came one day after the Washington Post reported that Mr Trump had revealed top secret information on a potential Isis plot to the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.\n\nMr Comey shared the memo — part of an extensive effort to document his interactions with the president — with top FBI officials, according to an associate who confirmed the existence of the memo and some of the lines that the FBI chief wrote in it.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Democrats pounced on the latest development about Mr Trump as evidence of a possible obstruction of justice. “If true, this is yet another disturbing allegation that the president may have engaged in some interference or obstruction of the investigation,” said Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee. “Enough is enough. Congress really needs to get to the bottom of this.”\n\nMany Republicans hunkered down as the latest bombshell rocked Mr Trump’s young presidency, but some members suggested that the scandals were reaching a new level. John McCain, the Arizona Republican senator who has been one of the harshest GOP critics of Mr Trump, said the controversies engulfing the president were of “Watergate size and scale”, in a reference to the scandal that brought down Richard Nixon.\n\n“Watergate was octopus-like, with so many tentacles it took an army of reporters to keep up. We’re not there yet, but Trump has one distinction,” said Larry Sabato, a politics expert at the University of Virginia. “We have never had a president so consumed by controversy and scandal this early in his term.”\n\nIn a worrying sign for Mr Trump that Republicans were becoming more nervous, Jason Chaffetz, the GOP head of the House oversight and government reform committee who has subpoena power, wrote to the FBI demanding “all memoranda, notes, summaries and recordings” regarding communications between Mr Trump and Mr Comey.\n\n“@GOPoversight is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready,” Mr Chaffetz tweeted.\n\nA spokesperson for Paul Ryan, the Republican House Speaker who was critical of Mr Trump during the campaign but who has been publicly supportive since his inauguration, said he supported the move by Mr Chaffetz to investigate the matter.\n\n“We need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House oversight committee to request this memo,” said his spokesperson.\n\nThe Comey memo is just the latest episode in a multi-faceted scandal about the role of Russia in the 2016 election that has engulfed Mr Trump and his top officials. In addition to the FBI probe, several congressional committees are investigating the issue.\n\nMr Trump fired Mr Flynn in February, after 24 days on the job, following a Washington Post report that the retired general had misled Mike Pence, the vice-president, about conversations he had held with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US.\n\nThe president frequently dismissed the FBI investigation, saying it was a “witch hunt” orchestrated by frustrated Democrats. But his comments have been contradicted by Mr Comey and other officials, who have publicly stated that the probe is serious.\n\nThe existence of the memo will increase pressure on Mr Comey to testify before Congress. He declined an invitation by the Senate intelligence committee to appear on Tuesday at a closed session, but is expected eventually to appear before lawmakers in a public hearing.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Trump implied that he may have taped his conversations with the FBI director. “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Mr Trump had tweeted.\n\nThe White House repeatedly has refused to confirm or deny whether Mr Trump has such tapes. If they exist, Congress should see them, Senator Angus King, an independent member of the Senate intelligence committee, said on Tuesday. “If there were tapes we need to have them . . . This is a very serious matter,” said Mr King.\n\nMatthew Miller, a justice department spokesman in the Obama administration, last week said Mr Comey habitually kept written accounts of events he found potentially inappropriate. \n\nThe associate of Mr Comey told the Financial Times that, “as a general matter, there was a real effort to document” the exchanges with the president.\n\nThe White House denied Mr Comey’s account. “While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,” it said. “This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr Comey.”\n\nSenator Richard Burr, who leads the Senate intelligence committee’s Russia probe, said Mr Comey had not informed him of the exchange with the president.\n\nMr Trump abruptly fired Mr Comey, explaining the move as motivated by “this Russia thing”, a reference to the FBI investigation.\n\nAndrew McCabe, the acting FBI director who had served as Mr Comey’s deputy, told Congress last week that “there has been no effort to impede our investigation to date”.\n\nThe Comey memo quotes Mr Trump as saying: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.”\n\nMr Trump added: “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.”\n\nMr Comey replied: “I agree he is a good guy.” \n\nBy the time of the February 14 meeting, Mr Comey had become uneasy about Mr Trump’s invitations to meet at the White House, including for a private dinner in late January, according to James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, who spoke with the FBI chief about it.\n\n“He mentioned that he had been invited to the White House to have dinner with the president and he was uneasy with that,” Mr Clapper said, adding that Mr Comey feared “compromising the integrity of the FBI”.\n\nAs Washington struggled to make sense of the latest developments, there were hints of the fierce political combat that may lie ahead. Within hours of the first reports of Mr Comey’s memo, Mr Trump’s campaign arm sent out a fundraising appeal entitled “sabotage”, blaming the media and “special interests” for undermining the president.\n\n“There are people within our own unelected bureaucracy that want to sabotage President Trump and our entire America First movement,” read the emailed alert, which suggested donations in amounts ranging from $1 to $2,500.\n\nFollow David J Lynch and Demetri Sevastopulo on Twitter:@davidjlynch, @dimi"],[5,"Trump Returns to Crisis Over Kushner as White House Tries to Contain It","Mr. Kushner’s troubles are only one facet of the crisis. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, also dropped off Mr. Trump’s trip early, in part to return to deal with the political furor over the Russia investigations and the president’s decision to fire James B. Comeyas F.B.I. director.\n\nThe White House was trying to figure out how to respond to reports that Mr. Kushner had spoken in December with Russia’s ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, about establishing a secret channel between his father-in-law’s transition team and Moscow to discuss the war in Syria and other issues. The Washington Post first reported on the suggestion on Friday, and three people informed about it confirmed it to The New York Times.\n\nThe discussion took place at Trump Tower at a meeting that also included Michael T. Flynn, who served briefly as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser until being forced out when it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about a separate telephone conversation he had with Mr. Kislyak. It was unclear who first proposed the secret communications channel, but the idea was for Mr. Flynn to speak directly with a Russian military official. The channel was never set up.\n\nAs reports emerged about investigators’ focus on Mr. Kushner, he and Ms. Trump discussed the possibility of having Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, issue a statement denying that Mr. McGahn had been contacted by federal officials about Mr. Kushner. Mr. McGahn, who has been increasingly uneasy in his role since Mr. Trump ignored his advice to delay Mr. Comey’s dismissal, said he was not the person to write such a statement, suggesting that doing so would create a precedent requiring a response to each new report. Mr. Kushner’s private lawyer issued a statement instead.\n\nMs. Trump and Mr. Kushner have complained privately about what he views as an unfair level of scrutiny of his actions. He has dismissed the attention on him as a reflection of his father-in-law’s unconventional approach to diplomacy and inexperience in government, rather than of anything nefarious he has done. People close to Mr. Kushner, who had lunch with Mr. Priebus on Friday and who projected an air of calm, were adamant that he was preparing for a long fight and not an exit from the White House.\n\nThe reports about Mr. Kushner dominated an end-of-trip briefing for reporters in Taormina, Italy, where Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the president’s national security adviser, and Gary D. Cohn, his top economic adviser, declined to comment specifically on Mr. Kushner but sought to play down the significance of the disclosures.\n\n“We have back-channel communications with any number of countries,” General McMaster said. “So, generally speaking, about back-channel communications, what that allows you to do is to communicate in a discreet manner. It doesn’t predispose you to any kind of content in that conversation.”\n\nHe did not say whether he was comfortable with the idea of a private citizen, as Mr. Kushner was at the time, opening such a back channel.\n\nBehind the scenes, Mr. Trump’s advisers were working to create a crisis-control communications operation within the White House to separate the Russia investigations and related scandals from the administration’s day-to-day themes and the work of governing, according to several people familiar with their plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to divulge the details of a still-evolving strategy.\n\nThe goal, these people said, is to give Mr. Trump more outlets for communicating his message in an unvarnished way, while curbing opportunities for aides to be confronted publicly with damaging developments or unflattering story lines.\n\nWhite House aides were trying to assemble a powerhouse outside legal team that they hoped would include seasoned Washington lawyers of the stature of Paul D. Clement, Theodore Olson or Brendan Sullivan, and they planned to introduce some of them to Mr. Trump as soon as this weekend. More lawyers could also be hired onto the White House staff to help Mr. McGahn.\n\nThe approach is modeled on the war room used by President Bill Clinton during various inquiries, including one that led to his impeachment for lying under oath about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Mr. Clinton retained a private legal team and established a separate office to handle questions about investigations, so that the White House could preserve the image of governing and keep its primary focus on the president’s broader message.\n\nAides are talking about bringing Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, and David Bossie, his former deputy campaign manager, onto the White House staff to manage the war room.\n\nUnder the evolving scenario, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, would take a diminished public role, with daily on-camera briefings replaced by more limited interactions with journalists, while Mr. Trump would seize more opportunities to communicate directly with his core supporters through campaign rallies, social media appearances such as Facebook Live videos, and interviews with friendly news organizations.\n\nThe president, who has more than 30 million followers on Twitter, has been told by his lawyers to limit his posts. Each one, they argue privately, could be used as evidence in a legal case against him, and the president went through his entire overseas trip without posting a single incendiary message.\n\nAmong those most adamant about limiting Mr. Trump’s access to the news media was Mr. Kushner, who has been critical internally of the White House press operation and has sought to marginalize Mr. Spicer, whom he views as too undisciplined to control the president’s message. Mr. Kushner has also favored creating a rapid-response team to counter reports like the ones that emerged on Friday.\n\nIn a move that many in the West Wing viewed as emblematic of his attempt to wrest control of communications from Mr. Spicer and Mr. Priebus, Mr. Kushner displaced an operations official from the office across the hall from his own and installed his spokesman, Josh Raffel, in his place, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nMr. Trump’s sons Donald Jr. and Eric, who now run the family business, have grown frustrated by the lack of a solid support system or effective surrogate operation to combat the spate of negative reports, according to three people who have spoken with them. The sons spent time on Thursday at the Republican National Committee headquarters, which was first reported by The Post. They also previously had a discussion with at least one Republican operative about beefing up communications at the campaign committee.\n\nRepublican strategists said it was vital for Mr. Trump to focus on advancing a legislative agenda to show voters that the administration could deliver policy changes and allay lawmakers’ simmering fears that the president’s troubles could damage their re-election chances.\n\n“What they need to do is crank up the legislative side of things and say, O.K., that’s going on, and Trump’s going to be Trump, but meanwhile, they’re actually working to get some kind of health care plan through the Senate, some kind of tax reform, and do what they promised they would,” said Rich Galen, a top adviser to Newt Gingrich when he was the House speaker during Mr. Clinton’s tenure.\n\nYet Mr. Trump’s push to revamp health care has faltered in Congress, and the White House has yet to present a detailed plan for his promised tax cuts.\n\nJoel Johnson, who was a top adviser to Mr. Clinton, said the traditional options available to a besieged president returning from overseas would be delivering a major speech, shaking up his staff and getting out on the road. But he said it was unclear whether Mr. Trump could do any of those things effectively enough to recapture control of his narrative.\n\n“You’re always looking for a reset button and how do we change the conversation,” Mr. Johnson said. “I wouldn’t want to be running the program down there right now. I don’t know where they go.”"],[5,"Billionaire Koch brothers lurk behind Trump Paris deal pull-out, but endgame is murky — RT US News","Trump’s highly controversial decision to leave the Paris Climate Agreement was well-telegraphed throughout his campaign, but speculation that his one-time detractors the billionaire business mogul Koch brothers were behind the decision is gaining momentum.\n\n“What’s happening behind here is real politics. This is the victory paid and carried out for 20 years by two people: David and Charles Koch. That’s what this is about,” Columbia University professor and Director of the Earth Institute Jeffrey Sachs said in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nSachs placed the blame for Trump’s decision squarely on the Koch brothers’ shoulders, claiming: “They have bought and purchased the top of the Republican party… Trump is a tool in this.”\n\nKoch Industries and its subsidiaries are a sprawling conglomerate that comprises everything from chemicals and plastics manufacturing to energy products such as natural gas and petroleum and even fertilizer and ranching, all of which are highly polluting industries that would greatly benefit from decreased regulation and government interference.\n\nSachs also referenced a recent letter by Republican senators to Trump, thanking him for rolling back regulations through a series of executive orders and throwing their support behind his stance on climate change.\n\nSachs is not alone in this stance, with prominent Democratic senators expressing similar sentiments online.\n\nDemocratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Environment Committee, pulled no punches in calling out the Koch brothers and their propaganda network in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\nWhile not alluding directly to the Koch brothers, Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy echoed Whitehouse’s sentiments. \n\nWhile the Koch brothers did not vocally support Trump on the election trail, it appears they have made their peace with the controversial president and his pro-business policies.\n\n“We’re principled, and if we can’t get comfortable with the policies that are in place, then we’re not going to support them,” Mark Holden, Koch Industries’s top lawyer, said previously as cited by the Washington Post.\n\nKoch Industries is the second-largest privately held company by revenue in the US, according to Forbes, and reportedly spent almost $900 million during the 2016 US presidential race through a variety of canvassing campaigns for a number of candidates.\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence, Environmental Protection Agency leader Scott Pruitt, and Marc Short, the Trump’s director of legislative affairs, all have ties to the Koch network, the Independent reports.\n\nWhile billionaires throwing money behind their preferred presidential candidates is nothing new, what stands out in this instance is that the Koch brothers’ sphere of influence extends far enough into another billionaire’s domain.\n\nIndeed, energy mogul and former billionaire T. Boone Pickens, a self-professed believer in climate change, applauded Trump for withdrawing from the Paris agreement.\n\n“The Paris Climate Accord is another bad deal negotiated by the Obama administration and America should applaud President Trump’s decision to exit,\" Pickens said in a statement published on his website.\n\nWhile on face value, Trump’s decision may appear to be borderline nihilistic to his critics, including a swathe of tech industry giants and former advisors who have jumped ship in the immediate aftermath, some suggest he may actually be setting up a bigger win in future.\n\nIn an Op-Ed piece published by Business Insider, Matthew De Bord suggests that Trump may be opening the door for the introduction of a carbon tax, a major goal of former advisor and Tesla CEO Elon Musk and an idea Trump’s current secretary of state and former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson has previously endorsed.\n\nTime will tell how the climate agreement fiasco ultimately plays out, but Dan Merica rightly pointed out that, either way, this may ultimately end up a non-issue."],[5,"Trump declares FBI and Robert Mueller 'very bad people' as he admits to obstruction investigation","The greatest witch hunt in political history? Granted the name ‘Donald Trump’ doesn’t appear in the Whitewater hearings, so he might have missed that, but surely Roy Cohn raised Trump on tales of the McCarthy hearings.\n\nIn any case, Trump’s tweet goes beyond fresh declarations of his own martyrdom. It also impugns the intelligence community, the Justice Department, and the special counsel as ‘very bad’ and ‘conflicted.’ These statements are sure to throw speculation that Trump will dismiss Mueller into overdrive. \n\nThat possibility is only heightened by a series of talking points put out by the RNC for Republicans to push back against stories of the investigation. Those talking points mirror Trump’s first post of the morning:\n\nIf this leaked account is true, it means the special counsel has struck out on collusion, and is shifting to obstruction to save face. After months of investigation, there is no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. According to Senator Risch, the Senate Committee has gone through thousands of documents and found no evidence of collusion. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle involved in the investigation have said there is zero evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nAll of these statements are distortions, but they all go to the same purpose, to denigrate the investigation, the FBI, and the special counsel. Republicans are being promoted to build the case that the investigation has already gone on too long, that it’s found nothing, and that it’s time to close it down. The talking points also set Mueller up as Trump’s opponent, out to “save face” by landing a charge on Trump.\n\nThose still maintaining that dismissing Mueller would be political suicide have missed the blinding fact that’s been obvious almost since the moment Trump glided down the escalator into the race two years ago: There is no such thing as political suicide.\n\nThe whole course of the election was a series of nowhe’s gone too far moments. There is no too far. Trump’s Fifth Avenue statement wasn’t a joke, it was a boast. He can fire Mueller. If that kicks off a fight in court, Trump will interfere with the court. If it leads to a decision against him, he’ll ignore it. Why not? Andrew Jackson did it.\n\nSo long as Republicans in Congress support him, he’ll do as he pleases. And Republicans will support him.\n\nThe Whitewater investigation carried on for more than four years before Bill Clinton was impeached on charges that had nothing to do with the original purpose of the investigation. Robert Mueller was appointed less than a month ago.\n\nDon’t expect him to get four years to make his case. "],[5,"Russia probe reaches current White House official, people familiar with the case say","The law enforcement investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign has identified a current White House official as a significant person of interest, showing that the probe is reaching into the highest levels of government, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe senior White House adviser under scrutiny by investigators is someone close to the president, according to these people, who would not further identify the official.\n\nThe revelation comes as the investigation appears to be entering a more overtly active phase, with investigators shifting from work that has remained largely hidden from the public to conducting interviews and using a grand jury to issue subpoenas. The intensity of the probe is expected to accelerate in the coming weeks, the people said.\n\nThe sources emphasized that investigators remain keenly interested in people who previously wielded influence in the Trump campaign and administration but are no longer part of it, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nFlynn resigned in February after disclosures that he had lied to administration officials about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Current administration officials who have acknowledged contacts with Russian officials include President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\n\nPeople familiar with the investigation said the intensifying effort does not mean criminal charges are near, or that any such charges will result. Earlier this week, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III to serve as special counsel and lead the investigation into Russian meddling.\n\nIt is unclear exactly how Mueller’s leadership will affect the direction of the probe, and he is already bringing in new people to work on the team. Those familiar with the case said its significance had increased before Mueller’s appointment.\n\nAlthough the case began quietly last July as an effort to determine whether any Trump associates coordinated with Russian operatives to meddle in the presidential election campaign, the investigative work now being done by the FBI also includes determining whether any financial crimes were committed by people close to the president. The people familiar with the matter said the probe has sharpened into something more fraught for the White House, the FBI and the Justice Department — particularly because of the public steps investigators know they now need to take, the people said.\n\nWhen subpoenas are issued or interviews are requested, it is possible the people being asked to talk or provide documents will reveal publicly what they were asked about.\n\nA small group of lawmakers known as the Gang of Eight was notified of the change in tempo and focus in the investigation at a classified briefing Wednesday evening, the people familiar with the matter said. Then-FBI Director James B. Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the investigation in March.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said, “I can’t confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of investigations or targets of investigations.” An FBI spokesman declined to comment.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said, “As the president has stated before, a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity.’’\n\nWhile there has been a loud public debate in recent days over the question of whether the president might have attempted to obstruct justice in his private dealings with Comey, whom Trump fired last week, people familiar with the matter said investigators on the case are more focused on Russian influence operations and possible financial crimes.\n\nThe FBI’s investigation seeks to determine whether and to what extent Trump associates were in contact with Kremlin operatives, what business dealings they might have had in Russia, and whether they in any way facilitated the hacking and publishing of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, during the presidential campaign. Several congressional committees are also investigating, though their probes could not produce criminal charges.\n\nA grand jury in Alexandria, Va., recently issued a subpoena for records related to Flynn’s business, the Flynn Intel Group, which was paid more than $500,000 by a company owned by a Turkish American businessman close to top Turkish officials, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Flynn Intel Group was paid for research on Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who Turkey’s current president believes was responsible for a coup attempt last summer. Flynn retroactively registered with the Justice Department in March as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interests.\n\nSeparately from the probe now run by Mueller, Flynn is being investigated by the Pentagon’s top watchdog for his foreign payments. Flynn also received $45,000 to appear in 2015 with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a dinner for RT, a Kremlin-controlled media organization.\n\nFlynn discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Russia’s ambassador to the United States during the month before Trump took office, and he withheld that fact from the vice president. That prompted then-acting attorney general Sally Yates to warn the White House’s top lawyer that Flynn might be susceptible to blackmail. Flynn stepped down after The Washington Post reported on the contents of the call.\n\nThe president has nonetheless seemed to defend his former adviser. A memo by Comey alleged that Trump asked that the probe into Flynn be shut down.\n\nThe White House also has acknowledged that Kushner met with Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, in late November. Kushner also has acknowledged that he met with the head of a Russian development bank, Vnesheconombank, which has been under U.S. sanctions since July 2014. The president’s son-in-law initially omitted contacts with foreign leaders from a national security questionnaire, though his lawyer has said publicly he submitted the form prematurely and informed the FBI soon after that he would provide an update.\n\nVnesheconombank handles development for the state, and in early 2015, a man purporting to be one of its New York-based employees was arrested and accused of being an unregistered spy.\n\nThat man — Evgeny Buryakov — ultimately pleaded guilty and was eventually deported. He had been in contact with former Trump adviser Carter Page, though Page has said he shared only “basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents” with the Russian. Page was the subject of a secret warrant last year issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, based on suspicions he might have been acting as an agent of the Russian government, according to people familiar with the matter. Page has denied any wrongdoing, and accused the government of violating his civil rights.\n\nEllen Nakashima and Ashley Parker contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:"],[5,"Dershowitz Says Special Counsel Will Help Trump: 'He's Going to Find No Crime'","Although many on the left have expressed their approval of Robert Mueller being appointed as special counsel to investigate possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Alan Dershowitz thinks Mueller could actually vindicate President Donald Trump, rather than bring about his downfall.\n\nOn \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" Dershowitz, a legal scholar and Harvard University Law School professor, said he doesn't see a crime that necessitated the appointment of a special counsel.\n\nHe explained that it would not be criminal, even if it happened, for the Trump campaign to have collaborated with the Russians in an effort to get their candidate elected.\n\n\"That's political wrongdoing, but it's just not a crime,\" Dershowitz said. \"Nobody can point me to a statute that would be violated. And a prosecutor is only allowed to look for evidence of a federal crime.\"\n\nHe said that he predicts the end result will be Mueller announcing no evidence of a crime, which would obviously be beneficial to Trump.\n\nDershowitz said the worst-case scenario for the White House would be that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn gets indicted, but even if that were to happen, Trump could pardon him.\n\n\"It's going to be done in secret, behind closed doors, and all we get in the end is no indictment or a lower-level former official gets indicted,\" Dershowitz said. \"And I think in the end that helps the Trump administration, not hurts them.\"\n\nWatch more above."],[5,"Trump Hands the Chinese a Gift: The Chance for Global Leadership","The president, and his defenders, argue that such views are held by an elite group of globalists who have lost sight of the essential element of American power: economic growth. Mr. Trump made that argument explicitly in the Rose Garden with his contention that the Paris accord amounted to nothing more than “a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.”\n\nIn short, he turned the concept of the agreement on its head. While President Barack Obama argued that the United Nations Green Climate Fund — a financial institution to help poorer nations combat the effects of climate change — would benefit the world, Mr. Trump argued that the American donations to the fund, which he halted, would beggar the country.\n\n“Our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty,” Mr. Trump said.\n\nThat, in short, encapsulates how Mr. Trump’s view of preserving American power differs from all of his predecessors, back to President Harry S. Truman. His proposed cuts to contributions to the United Nations and to American foreign aid are based on a presumption that only economic and military power count. “Soft power” — investments in alliances and broader global projects — are, in his view, designed to drain influence, not add to it, evident in the fact that he did not include the State Department among the agencies that are central to national security, and thus require budget increases.\n\nIt will take years to determine the long-term effects of his decision to abandon the Paris agreement, to the environment and to the global order. It will not break alliances: Europe is hardly about to embrace a broken, corrupt Russia, and China’s neighbors are simultaneously drawn to its immense wealth and repelled by its self-interested ambitions.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has added to the arguments of leaders around the world that it is time to rebalance their portfolios by effectively selling some of their stock in Washington. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has already announced her plan to hedge her bets, declaring last weekend after meeting Mr. Trump that she had realized “the times when we could completely rely on others are, to an extent, over.”\n\nThat may be temporary: It is still possible that Mr. Trump’s announcement on Thursday will amount to a blip in history, a withdrawal that takes so long — four years — that it could be reversed after the next presidential election. But for now it leaves the United States declaring that it is better outside the accord than in, a position that, besides America, has so far only been taken by Syria and Nicaragua. (Syria did not sign on because it is locked in civil war, Nicaragua because it believes the world’s richest nations did not sacrifice enough.)\n\nBut it is the relative power balance with China that absorbs anyone who studies the dance of great powers. Even before Mr. Trump’s announcement, President Xi Jinping had figured out how to embrace the rhetoric, if not the substance, of global leadership.\n\nMr. Xi is no free trader, and his nation has overtaken the United States as the greatest emitter of carbon by a factor of two. Only three years ago, it was a deal between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi that laid the groundwork for what became the broader Paris agreement.\n\nYet for months the Chinese president has been stepping unto the breach, including giving speeches at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that made it sound like China alone was ready to adopt the role of global standard-setter that Washington has occupied since the end of World War II.\n\n“What the Paris accord represented, in a fractured world, was finally some international consensus, led by two big polluters, China and the United States, on a common course of action,” said Graham T. Allison, the author of a new book, “Destined For War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?”\n\n“What you’d expect us to do is sustain our position by maintaining our most important relationship around the world and address what the citizens of our allies consider their most important problems: economic growth and an environment that sustains their children and grandchildren,’’ he added. “Instead, we are absenting the field.”\n\nThat sentiment was evident on Thursday in Berlin. Just hours before Mr. Trump spoke, China’s premier, Li Keqiang, stood alongside Ms. Merkel, and used careful words as he described China as a champion of the accord. China believed that fighting climate change was an “international responsibility,” Mr. Li said, the kind of declaration that American diplomats have made for years when making the case to combat terrorism or nuclear proliferation or hunger.\n\nChina has long viewed the possibility of a partnership with Europe as a balancing strategy against the United States. Now, with Mr. Trump questioning the basis of NATO, the Chinese are hoping that their partnership with Europe on the climate accord may allow that relationship to come to fruition faster than their grand strategy imagined.\n\nNaturally, the Chinese are using the biggest weapon in their quiver: Money. Their plan, known as “One Belt, One Road,” is meant to buy China influence from Ethiopia to Britain, from Malaysia to Hungary, all the while refashioning the global economic order.\n\nMr. Xi announced the sweeping initiative last month, envisioning spending $1 trillion on huge infrastructure projects across Africa, Asia and Europe. It is a plan with echoes of the Marshall Plan and other American efforts at aid and investment, but on a scale with little precedent in modern history. And the clear subtext is that it is past time to toss out the rules of aging, American-dominated international institutions, and to conduct commerce on China’s terms."],[5,"Does Trump Know the First Thing About Health Care? Aide","On Wednesday morning, the president woke up and then began angrily tweetstorming about his allegedly deep knowledge of the American health care system.\n\n“Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in health care,” Donald Trump tweeted from his personal @realDonaldTrump account. “Wrong, I know the subject well & want victory for U.S.”\n\nThe president’s close aides and political advisers, six of whom spoke to The Daily Beast on the condition of anonymity in order to speak freely, would beg to differ. Some of them simply laughed at the very suggestion that the president knows much, or even cares, about health care policy in this country.\n\nTrump’s Wednesday hate-tweets came the morning after a story was published at The New York Times that stated that one Republican senator who supports the Senate’s Trumpcare legislation exited a Tuesday meeting with President Trump at the White House with the strong impression that “the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the Senate plan.” Furthermore, Trump appeared “especially confused when a moderate Republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy,” according to the Times’ account.\n\nThis report, and the unnamed senator’s suggestion of Trump’s ignorance and policy confusion, irked the president and, according to one White House official speaking to The Daily Beast, made him noticeably “furious again” in his ongoing, obsessive feud with various media outlets, which he habitually knocks as “failing” and “FAKE NEWS.”\n\nMultiple senior administration and White House officials all independently described Trump as either detached from or barely interested in the complicated details and tricky politics of subsidies, Obamacare markets and taxes, the Medicaid expansion, and the safety net.\n\nFollowing the Trump administration’s failure at managing an aggressive, threat-filled push to pass the initial House version of the Obamacare repeal in March, White House officials privately concede that it is actually better for Republicans when the president disengages more from being a policy negotiator.\n\nWhen asked if the president understood or had a solid grasp on the important facets of the Senate or House incarnations of repeal-and-replace, one official—who who works closely with the president on health-care policy, replied initially with a few moments of light chuckling—before answering “not to my knowledge.”\n\n“The president understands winning,” another official noted, adding a stuck-out-tongue emoji to the correspondence.\n\nThis notion was once again reinforced by the president’s own words this week. On Wednesday, he told reporters that \"we're going to have a big surprise…a great, great surprise\" regarding health care, and has routinely spoke of finally \"winning\" and \"victory\" at last for Republicans on gutting Obamacare.\n\nThe fact that President Trump is about as far from a policy wonk as you can get in politics isn’t some new revelation. Few involved in the president’s political rise in the Republican Party, or his current administration, will be shocked to hear that Trump is disengaged with, or straight-up bored by, policy minutiae.\n\nOne former senior Trump campaign aide recalled to The Daily Beast several instances throughout 2016 when the Republican presidential contender would privately appear to confuse Medicaid and Medicare, and the functions and purposes of each. He would at times conflate to the two and had to be reminded of which one was which.\n\n\"There would be times when he would describe what was clearly Medicare...but say Medicaid, and when we pointed that out, he would say, 'That's what I said, Medicare and Medicaid,'\" the source recounted.\n\nSometimes Trump would be on the ball regarding the key distinctions—and sometimes he’d conspicuously fall off.\n\nThe former aide added that campaign staff would move on instead of lecturing or drilling in the policy specifics with Trump because those details weren’t important to the debate prep or his rallies, and that no one wanted to risk making him look \"dumb.\"\n\nAsked about the president’s inattention to policy details, including the detail that he would repeatedly confuse the country’s two largest federal health care programs, Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders only would reiterate Trump’s general commitment to rolling back the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“The President has been talking about repealing and replacing Obamacare since the campaign started,” Sanders told The Daily Beast in an email. “He has made it a priority in his administration and he is committed to reforming health care to make it better for all Americans.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump pledged repeatedly and emphatically that he would not cut Medicaid, Medicare, or Social Security, in contrast to nearly all of his Republican opponents. However, Trumpcare would take a sledgehammer to Medicaid, in particular.\n\nFor President Trump to go back on such a major campaign promise makes more sense when considering that candidate Trump didn’t have much commitment to these ideas or principles in the first place.\n\nA second former Trump campaign aide said the details of proposals on health care—and virtually every other policy area with the exceptions of trade and immigration—weren’t much of a consideration.\n\n“It wasn’t really a policy oriented campaign—policy wasn’t on our radar,” the former aide said. “The sense was, say what wins and figure out the details later.”\n\nThe health care policy proposals that emerged from a campaign so unconcerned with policy minutiae had right-leaning wonks and think-tank fellows aghast.\n\nWhen the Trump campaign rolled out a health care policy blueprint in the spring of 2016, Michael Cannon, an issue expert at the libertarian Cato Institute and a vehement Obamacare foe, panned the proposal.\n\n“This isn’t a health reform plan,” Cannon wrote at the time. “It’s a campaign operative copying and pasting a bunch of stuff from the around the web, without knowing what it means or even realizing that he’s describing current law. It shows Trump is as unserious about reforming health care as ever.\n\n“He doesn’t have a plan,” Cannon added. “He has paroxysms.”\n\nTrump’s health-care proposal, wrote Republican health policy adviser Avik Roy, at the time an adviser to Trump primary rival Sen. Marco Rubio, “has the look and feel of something that a 22-year-old congressional staffer would write for a backbencher based on a cursory review of Wikipedia.”\n\nAnd The New York Timesis hardly the only news outlet corroborating this assessment this week. Earlier this week, the neoconservative publication The Weekly Standard reported that “several senators who have spoken with Trump about the evolving legislation describe an executive with little apparent understanding of the basic principles of the reforms and virtually no understanding of the details” of Trumpcare.\n\nTrump’s apparent disdain, or aversion, towards tackling the specifics or nuances of his own administration’s policies goes far beyond health care.\n\nLess than a month after Trump assumed the presidency, Mother Jonesreported on leaked classified guidance that had been sent to intel analysts tasked with compiling material for the president’s daily briefing on national-security threats. The guidance showed how President Trump’s daily nat-sec briefing intentionally contains less nuance and far less information than reports presented to Trump predecessors—“about a quarter of the information President Barack Obama received,” MoJo reported.\n\n“It is fair to say the president takes [a] similar approach to health care,” a White House official told The Daily Beast. “[It’s] ‘less is more.’”"],[5,"Top Democrat on House Intel Committee calls for review of Kushner's security clearance","The House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat called for a review of Jared Kushner's security clearance over questions of whether he was truthful about his contacts with Russia.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-California, spoke to ABC News' Martha Raddatz in an exclusive interview on \"This Week\" Sunday in the wake of revelations that Kushner, the son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump, talked to the Russian ambassador about establishing a back channel for communications in December, before Trump took office.\n\n“If these allegations are true and he had discussions with the Russians about establishing a backchannel and didn't reveal that, that's a real problem in terms of whether he should maintain that kind of a security clearance,” Schiff said.\n\n\"There ought to be a review of his security clearance to find out whether he was truthful, whether he was candid\" about his Russia contacts, Schiff added in an apparent reference to what Kushner may have submitted in the security clearance application process. \"If not, than there's no way he can maintain that kind of a clearance.\"\n\nKushner, who met with the Russian ambassador in December along with Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, asked for back-channel communications to discuss Syria and other policy matters, sources told ABC News.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is calling for Kushner's security clearance to be suspended until the federal investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump associates is completed.\n\n\"The FBI's Russia investigation reached Trump's backyard, and now it's in his house,\" the DNC deputy communications director Adrienne Watson said in a statement Thursday. \"Kushner's security clearance should be suspended until the FBI's findings are complete.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence operatives reportedly learned about Kushner's interest in back-channel talks through communications that Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak had with Moscow. Raddatz said Kislyak must know \"he’s being monitored all the time\" and asked Schiff if it was possible the Russians wanted U.S. intelligence to hear what the Russian ambassador said about Kushner.\n\n\"Could it be a ruse\" by Russia to get Americans to suspect Kushner? Raddatz asked.\n\nSchiff responded, \"Certainly in dealings with the Russians, they're very sophisticated, you always have to take into consideration that the Russians may be doing things that are designed to throw you off the track or provoke discord.\"\n\nHe added, though, that \"it's hard to understand ... why this would be some kind of a Russian ruse. Why would they want to undermine the very government that they hope to have a good relationship with?\"\n\nSchiff said that he expects Kushner to be asked to testify before the House Intelligence Committee. The House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat called for a review of Jared Kushner's security clearance over questions of whether he was truthful in his application about his contacts with Russia."],[5,"Trump Wanted Comey to Refute False Notion He Was Suspect","On March 30, 2017, by his own account, then-FBI director James Comey told President Donald Trump that Trump himself was not under investigation — the third time he had given him that assurance. In fact, Comey told Trump that he had just assured members of Congress that Trump was not a suspect under investigation.\n\nThink about that.\n\nThis was fully six weeks after the then-director’s Oval Office meeting with the president, during which Comey alleges that Trump told him, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” Flynn, of course, is Michael Flynn, the close Trump campaign adviser and original Trump national-security adviser, whom Trump, with pained reluctance, had fired just the day before.\n\nInteresting thing about that. Most of the time, when public officials obstruct an investigation, there is a certain obsessiveness about it. Because, in the usual situation, the official has been paid off, or the official is worried that the subject of the investigation will inculpate the official if the investigation is allowed to continue. There is great pressure on the official to get the case shut down.\n\nBut not Trump, he of the notoriously short attention span.\n\nTrump was feeling remorse over Flynn. What he told Comey, in substance, was that Flynn had been through enough. A combat veteran who had served the country with distinction for over 30 years, and who had not done anything wrong by speaking with the Russian ambassador as part of the Trump transition, Flynn had just been cashiered in humiliating fashion. The one who had done the cashiering was Trump, and he was still upset about it.\n\nThat, obviously, is why he lobbied Comey on Flynn’s behalf. And as I have pointed out before, it was an exercise in weighing the merits of further investigation and prosecution that FBI agents and federal prosecutors do hundreds of times a day, throughout the country. That matters because, as their superior and as the constitutional official whose power these subordinates exercise, Trump has as much authority to do this weighing as did Comey — who worked for Trump, not the other way around.\n\nThe thing to notice, though, was that Trump never did it again. After Comey’s description of this February 14 encounter, the word “Flynn” never appears again in Comey’s written testimony. This appears to be the one and only time that Trump advocated on Flynn’s behalf.\n\nIf Trump was obstructing an investigation, he was awfully passive about it.\n\nBut Trump did not issue any such order. By the former director’s own account, the words Trump used left the decision about pursuing Flynn to Comey’s discretion — notwithstanding that, as chief executive, Trump had the legitimate authority to order Comey to close the case. Moreover, at the time these events actually happened, Comey took no action consistent with someone who understood himself to be under a directive by the president of the United States. He and the FBI continued the investigation.\n\nTrump not only did not stop them from doing that. He never asked about the matter again. After the immediacy of the president’s anguish over having to fire his friend, Flynn seems to have faded from memory. Trump could have pardoned Flynn, he could have stepped in and ordered an end to the investigation at any time. He’s never done either.\n\nComey, meanwhile, also took no action consistent with someone who believed he had witnessed a crime. He now says he can’t say for sure whether it was or it wasn’t obstruction. But he is a highly experienced former prosecutor and investigator who has handled obstruction cases. He is an expert in this area of the law. At the time it happened, he did not report to his superiors at the Justice Department that the president had committed obstruction — although he would have been required to do that if he believed it had happened.\n\nWhat about Congress? Did he report it to Congress, in whistleblower fashion?\n\nActually, he did the opposite.\n\nOn March 20, over a month after the Flynn conversation, Comey gave his stunning congressional testimony, pronouncing publicly that the FBI was conducting a counterintelligence probe of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, and that the probe included scrutinizing both the ties of Trump associates to the Putin regime and “any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian efforts.” The FBI, he darkly added, would make “an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.”\n\nClearly, this led the media and much of the country to assume the FBI director had confirmed that the president was a suspect in what appeared to be a criminal investigation. It similarly alarmed lawmakers. Comey thus privately assured members of Congress that the president was not a suspect in any FBI investigation.\n\nBut he would not correct the misimpression being formed by the public, relying on his testimony.\n\nThen, on March 30, he again assured Trump that Trump was not a suspect in any FBI investigation.\n\nPatently, Comey and the FBI did not believe Trump had obstructed an investigation by lobbying on Flynn’s behalf. And just as patently, that’s because Trump did not do so: You cannot act corruptly – as the obstruction statute requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt – if you do not believe what you are doing is against the law. Since Trump had as much authority as any prosecutor or FBI agent to weigh the merits of prosecuting Flynn, he cannot have acted corruptly in doing so.\n\nSo, given that no one who was aware of the facts believed that Trump had committed obstruction at the time the conduct occurred, why is Trump now reportedly under investigation for obstruction?\n\nMy surmise: The Obama administration and the intelligence community conflated the real threat of Russian interference in the American electoral process with the false narrative of Trump-campaign collusion in the interference. In an explosive announcement that departed from Justice Department protocols against commenting on investigations, then-director Comey gave congressional testimony that induced the media to report, and much of the public to believe, that Trump was a prime suspect in an FBI investigation, focused on a suspected conspiracy between his campaign and Russia to tamper with the election process. The FBI was even assessing whether criminal charges should be filed.\n\nTrump knew that this was not true because Comey had repeatedly told him it was not true — both before and after Comey’s March 20 congressional testimony. Yet, in what Trump had to find an exasperating and inexplicable stance, Comey refused to state publicly that Trump was not under investigation, even though — in a deviation from both law-enforcement guidelines and the assurances he had given the president — Comey had led the world to believe that Trump was under investigation.\n\nTrump did not do anything to interfere with the investigation of Russia’s interference in the election. According to Comey’s testimony, the president even said it would be good to find out if any of Trump’s “satellites” — his associates — had done anything wrong.\n\nWhat the president appears to have objected to, and to have sought help refuting, was what he saw as the fraudulent claim — subtly advanced by Comey and perhaps others in the intelligence community — that he personally had colluded with Russia in connection with the election, and that he was a criminal suspect.\n\nThat is not obstruction of an investigation. It is objection to a narrative — a narrative that the intelligence agencies knew was false yet refused to correct, no matter how much it was, and is, damaging Trump’s capacity to govern.\n\n—Andrew C.

Barely anyone in the country beyond the bounds of the Consulate and possibly a smattering of British-themed fish-n-chip pubs paid the blindest bit of attention to the political tremors going on in ye olde country. This would be on account of their having a few of their own to contend with. Comey commands the headlines here, not Corbyn or Clegg. \n\nAnd Britain, after all, is confusing. Americans have seen more of Nigel Farage than they have of Theresa May, because of his past palling around with Donald Trump. They will watch a bit of Wimbledon and, who knows, they might take that trip. Because, GREAT should really read CHEAP, when you consider the fresh battering the pound took early Friday against the dollar.\n\nWhat may sink in about the UK election results is a vague sense of additional unease about the state of the world at a time when everyone surely needs less of it. Britain has been the most important sinew in the post-World War II bond of democracy and economic prosperity between the US and all of Europe. That that connection seems in various ways to have frayed is good news for no one. \n\nBarack Obama has some responsibility for making the special relationship somewhat less so. It wasn’t just the flap over removing Winston Churchill from the Oval office. (The old boy’s back now, of course, in all his dulled-bronze and glowering splendour.) He deliberately turned America’s gaze east and south towards Asia and in so much as he paid heed to Europe it was more to Merkel than to Cameron or Brown. Maybe after Brexit, he considered that smart. \n\nIt was Obama who warned Britain that leaving Europe would mean it going to the back of the queue for a new trade deal with America. He was widely criticised for it and even blamed for stoking anti-Leave sentiment ahead of Britain’s referendum. But there is no reason to assume he was wrong or that when negotiations for such a deal begin, the Trump administration will be anything but tungsten-tough in its stance. You saw what Trump told Germany about selling too many cars in America. Flipping trade flows to America’s advantage is the heart of brand Trump. \n\nAnd as much as Trump appears to dislike regional trade treaties – he wants to tweak Nafta with Canada and Mexico and has put the kibosh on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP – it remains the case that when it comes to looking eastward the priority for his trade negotiators will be the putative Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union even if for the moment talks have stalled. Britain, presumably, won’t be part of it.\n\nPut together the irritations in the US-UK relationship amount to a malaise, meanwhile. Some are multi-lateral in nature. Let’s leave aside consideration of whether Britain departing the European Union will make it a bigger or lesser force in the world, even if it’s hard to make an argument in support of the former. But which British leader would have ever imagined being lectured outside Nato headquarters by a sitting American president about defence spending levels while at the same time hearing nothing from him about the Alliance’s mutual defence provisions?\n\nWe meanwhile have the highly unusual spectacle of Britain publicly squabbling with the US in the sphere of intelligence-sharing – for years at the very heart of the security relationship between them – because of the apparent leaking by US officials to the American media of details of the police investigation in the immediate aftermath of the Manchester arena bombing. Trump promised to deal with that but only because stopping leaks is something of a fetish with him.\n\nStill more dispiriting was Trump’s toxic sniping at the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, straight after the terror attack just a week ago at Borough Market. You may recall, he suggested that the leader of the nation’s capital had been “pathetic” in his response to the crisis. He willfully took Khan’s words out of context by suggesting he’d said Londoner’s shouldn’t be alarmed by what had happened and did it via Twitter, naturally. “It was stunning for all us in America, and indefensible,” former CIA and National Security Agency head Michael Hayden sputtered in The Guardian. Khan was himself withering in return. “I don’t know how to tell you this, but I really don’t care…I really couldn’t be bothered about what Donald Trump tweets.”\n\nThere are more tests to come. Khan was also asked about that other small matter on the horizon – a state visit by Trump to Britain for tea with the Queen and whatever else May lays on for him. If May is the host, of course. Maybe put him on a polo horse. Or in the Tower of London. Khan said it should not happen and there are many, in Parliament and elsewhere, who share the sentiment. When the time arrives, Trump’s visit, unless a way is found to shelve it, is likely only to highlight how strained the so-called special relationship has become. \n\nSome will meanwhile try to discern some greater electoral meaning from the shock outcome of the British vote. Did May’s failure to distance herself more from Trump harm her? Should Corbyn have gone the full Bernie Sanders? And what about for America and its current political maelstrom? Does the faltering of the hard-Brexit Tories spell an ebbing of the populist tide for Trump, who continues to play the isolationist-America First card with his base?  \n\nWhat we do know is that no one is doing very much to get the Anglo-American partnership happy again. Britain has Europe to worry about. And with the Russia-Trump investigation taking on a more menacing mien every day, America has America to worry about. Britain may be GREAT (and cheap) but who is going to make the Anglo-American relationship great again?"],[5,"\"Pay Trump Bribes Here\" Was Projected Across The Entrance Of Trump's DC Hotel","Photos of a large light projection were shared online late Monday night showing protest messages sprawled across the front of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, including one that read \"Pay Trump Bribes Here\" with an arrow pointing to the hotel's entrance.\n\n\"It was about 10 minutes before the security came,\" Robin Bell, the social justice artist behind the projections, told BuzzFeed News. \"They blocked the projector.\"\n\nBell said he has outfitted a \"projection van, so we pulled up and did it.\" But one security guard came up to the projector and \"walked right up to the lens.\"\n\nWitnesses who saw the video projection shared photos online of projections saying \"Emoluments Welcome\" with an \"Open 24 Hour\" motel sign. Another photo showed the text of the Emoluments Clause, a part of the Constitution that watchdog groups have said blocks Trump-owned businesses from accepting payments from foreign governments.\n\nBell said he chose to show flags in his projection of \"the countries we know for sure are paying Trump money.\" A video taken by Bell and his team shows flags for Turkey, China, Saudi Arabia, and Russia waving in the installation."],[5,"For the U.S.-European alliance, everything has changed","Just returned from Europe. Trip was a great success for America. Hard work but big results!\n\n— Donald Trump, Sunday morning\n\nFor more than four months, the White House has confirmed no European ambassadors, filled no high-level diplomatic jobs and given no indication that it ever will. Occasional envoys, the vice president and defense secretary among them, have floated across the Atlantic, carrying messages of general reassurance. They have reconfirmed America’s commitment to NATO, spoken of old ties and old alliances, hinted and winked that nothing has changed.\n\nEuropeans listened and pretended to believe them. Sure, one of them told me after hearing the vice president speak in February in Munich, “all of that’s true until the guy’s next tweet.” But in the space of two short days last week, President Trump himself ended those months of uncertainty without a tweet. Now we know: The envoys were unreliable. And everything really has changed.\n\nWhat actually happened in Belgium and Italy? Having declared in Saudi Arabia that he would not “lecture” Arab leaders about human rights, Trump arrived in Brussels and began to lecture America’s closest allies, accusing them of owing “massive amounts of money” to NATO and U.S. taxpayers. This made no sense: NATO is not a club like Mar-a-Lago with annual dues. But it was a clear sign, at last, of what many had suspected all along: Trump prefers the company of dictators who flatter him to democrats who treat him as an equal.\n\nA few hours later, at a meeting on trade, Trump complained that Germany is “bad” because of the “millions of cars they are selling to the U.S.” and appeared to want to rewrite America’s trade deal with Germany. This made no sense either: As a part of the European Union, Germany does not negotiate its own trade deals. Also, German companies make “millions of cars” inside the United States, about the same number as they sell. But the comments made it clear: The days when the United States led the world in trade are over too.\n\nAt no point did the president seem to understand his role of alliance leader. Pressed to commit to a climate-change treaty, he tweeted, “I’ll be making my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!” — almost as if this were a television series that relied on cliffhangers to keep people watching. Proving that he still sees the world through the eyes of a property developer, he complained to the Belgian prime minister about European regulations that had slowed down the construction of one of his golf courses. Before the NATO summit photograph, Trump shoved aside the Montenegrin prime minister to put himself in front, because that’s what boorish celebrities do.\n\nAt no point did the president even appear to understand the issues at stake either. During his NATO speech, he failed to mention Article 5, the clause that commits NATO members to defending one another if attacked. Later he declared that his trip would pave the way for “peace through strength,” though it was clear he had no idea what that phrase, used by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, actually means: “We’re gonna have a lot of strength, and we’re gonna have a lot of peace,” he explained.\n\nAfter the visit ended, presidential aides rushed in to explain what the president meant to say. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, immediately declared that Trump had supported Article 5. But this time no one pretended to believe him.\n\nAs a result of this trip, American influence, always exercised in Europe through mutually beneficial trade and military alliances, is at its rockiest in recent memory. The American-German relationship, the core of the transatlantic alliance for more than 70 years, has just hit a new low: On Sunday, the German chancellor told a sympathetic crowd that Germany could no longer depend on America, given what she had “experienced in the last few days.” The Russian government, which has long sought to expel the United States from the continent, is overjoyed: On Russian television, Trump was said to have turned NATO into a “house of cards.”\n\nA “great success for America”? If that was “success,” then I’d hate to see failure."],[5,"Bernie Sanders explains why Trump is so dangerous","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders may have lost his bid for the White House in 2016, but he’s sure as hell not ready to fade into obscurity anytime soon. Instead, he’s emerged as a gadfly, loudly and publicly sounding the alarm on what he sees as the country’s troubling descent into authoritarianism under President Donald Trump.\n\n“I can't remember a president who has had more authoritarian tendencies than Trump,” Sanders told me in an interview on Wednesday. “What is going on is not only this rise of authoritarianism but also, simultaneously, you are seeing this country move very rapidly toward oligarchy.”\n\nAs Sanders prepared to give a big speech on Thursday at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he got on the phone with me to talk about Trump’s admiration for authoritarian leaders, his attacks on the media, the Russia investigation, and more.\n\nSanders told me he believes Trump has a basic disrespect for the fundamental pillars of democracy — the press, the judicial system — that mimics the authoritarian regimes the Trump administration has cozied up to around the globe. And that combination, he says, is dangerous.\n\nWhat follows is a partial transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nThere has never been a president, or even a leading public official, who has lied as often or as dangerously as Trump has.\n\nAnd when the president of the United States lies a whole lot and makes outrageous statements, it's not only bad unto itself, but it also opens the door for other people to be lying and for truth to be disrespected. And that is a very dangerous thing for the fabric of American society.\n\nWhen he talks about 3 to 5 million people voting illegally in the last election — no one believes that, it is an outrageous lie —- but what that does is tell Republican governors that they should go forward to suppress the vote, to make it harder for people to vote, under the guise of voter fraud.\n\nEvery politician has disagreements with the media and how they cover this or that story, and I am certainly one of those. But there has never been a president, or political leader, who has basically said, “Everything you see on mainstream television or mainstream media — the New York Times, the Washington Post, Vox, whatever it may be — is a lie, don’t believe it.”\n\nIf you take that to its logical conclusion, and some people have, then where do you get the truth? Where do you learn about what’s going on that you can’t see with your own eyes? Who’s going to help you? It kind of leads you to the conclusion that there is only one person in America who can tell us the truth, and that is the president of the United States.\n\nDo you think he’s a demagogue?\n\nWell, I think that ... let me continue and then you can ask me a question, fair enough?\n\nSo you have this unprecedented attack on the media. What this guy is doing is basically telling the American people, “You cannot trust anything in mainstream media.”\n\nThen, on top of that, he is attacking the judiciary system and Department of Justice. A judge rules against him — that is not unusual; judges often rule against presidents and against legislation — but you don't go around undermining the judiciary and calling people “so-called judges” because they ruled against you.\n\nThen on top of that, you have his support for authoritarian leaders.\n\nThe American people, I think, whether you are a Republican or Democrat, have a hard time understanding his affection for a guy like [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, who has worked overtime to undermine not only democracy in his own country but also democracy in the United States.\n\nDo you want a good relationship with Russia? Of course you do. But why would you have what appears to be a personal affection for an authoritarian leader? It is not just Putin. It is also [President Rodrigo] Duterte of the Philippines; it is the royal family of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAgain: You may want to make alliances, you may not; those are debates you have to have. But for a country like the United States, which has been seen, historically, as one of the great promoters of democracy, why have this affinity for so many authoritarian countries?\n\nI have spoken to conservatives who share these exact same concerns.\n\nDo you see this as a global phenomenon? Why do you think we may be seeing public support around the world for authoritarian characters or politicians? And, go back to my original question, do you think he is a demagogue — is that what you are moving toward saying?\n\nLet me take the last question first. Both good questions.\n\nYou can contrast this with a very conservative Republican president named George W. Bush. I opposed Bush on virtually every piece legislation, every initiative, he put forward. Virtually all of them. But if you remember, Bush’s response to 9/11 was to visit a mosque — a very profound statement for a conservative Republican — essentially what he was saying is that we have to stand together, don't judge people by religion or by the color of their skin, and that America is a country which belongs to all of us.\n\nContrast that with Trump’s effort to start a program in which is he is documenting every crime an undocumented person commits, [his] verbal attacks against Latinos and against Muslims, and his effort, it seems to me, to try to make political points by dividing us up by scapegoating minorities.\n\nThat is not what a leader of any democratic country should be doing. That is part of the tradition and history of demagoguery. It divides people up.\n\nThat leads to your other question: Is this happening around the world? The answer is yes, it is.\n\nAnd why is it happening? For a lot of the same reasons it is happening in the United States. The radical changes to the global economy over the last 40 to 50 years, which have benefited some people, no question about it, but have left behind tens and tens of millions of people who are today working longer hours for lower wages, who are worried to death about whether their kids can afford to go to college and whether their kids will ever have a standard of living as high as they themselves have.\n\nA whole lot of people have been left behind in the global economy, in the United States — in rural areas, in inner cities all over this country. A lot of people have been left behind, and they are angry, they are furious, and they think people do not understand their pain. And then you have demagogues trying to explain that the problem is some Mexican farm worker who makes eight bucks an hour or someone who is a Muslim.\n\nTens and tens of millions of Americans today are struggling to keep heads above water economically.\n\nWhat rational leadership is about is putting those problems on the table and saying, “All right, here are problems: We’ve got 28 million Americans with no health insurance. How do we deal with that issue?” rather than demagoguing about that issue and blaming minorities for the problems the country faces.\n\nThis is certainly an international phenomenon — you see it with the National Front in France, and you see [a] similar type phenomenon with Putin in Russia.\n\nIn Berlin this May, you gave a speech where you said, “What has become absolutely clear since the election is that Donald Trump represents something we haven’t seen before in the United States. A trend toward authoritarianism, a normalization of corruption and the rise of oligarchy.” Can you unpack the last part of that sentence?\n\nYou got my quote right.\n\nWhat is going on is not only this rise of authoritarianism but also, simultaneously, you are seeing this country move very rapidly toward oligarchy.\n\nThe media doesn't talk about it very often. I do. Because it's frightening, and I don't think the media is comfortable with it — but the truth is in America today, you have the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and you’ve got 20 people in America owning as much wealth as [the] bottom half of America, and you are seeing 52 percent of all new income generated today going to the top 1 percent.\n\nSo just an incredible inequality, in terms of wealth and income, that we have not seen since the Great Depression, since 1928.\n\nOn top of that, [we have] a political system in which the Koch brothers and other billionaires are able to spend unlimited sums through Citizens United to buy elections for the candidates who represent their interests.\n\nYou add that together with a media which is also increasingly owned by fewer and fewer people around the world. I think it is fair to say we are moving toward oligarchy, where we have an economy and a political system controlled by few incredibly wealthy people.\n\nAnd [as to] the corruption aspect of this: There is an incredible blurring of business interests for the Trump family with public policy. Is Trump making foreign policy decisions on behalf of the American people and what is best for the world? Or is he making those decisions on behalf of Trump enterprises? That’s a whole other area.\n\nThere seems little doubt that Russians attempted in some way to influence our election. How has this played out in terms of how you see the Trump administration moving toward authoritarianism?\n\nWell, that’s a question that obviously is being investigated right now. You are right there is nobody who denies that Russia played a significant role in trying to influence the election on behalf of Trump. So the question being investigated now is was there collusion? And you have [special counsel Robert] Mueller and his team working on that, and you have the House and Senate Intelligence Committees working on that. We will see where that will go.\n\nI don’t have the answer, and I don't want to speak before I have facts in front of us. Trump fired [FBI Director James] Comey. Did he fire Comey because he thought Comey was a bad FBI director and he needed a change in the FBI? If that is the case, that is what a president can do.\n\nOr did he fire Comey because Comey was launching a significant investigation about possible collusion of the Trump campaign with Russia? If that’s the case, then that's just another argument about the movement of this country toward authoritarianism, because that is obstructing justice. And that’s what’s being looked at.\n\nYou said a few times that this is a first in American history — but there are aspects of these issues that have repeated themselves throughout history. Do you think this a repeat of something we saw in the 1930s, for example, or otherwise?\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nYes and no. Yes — look, we had Joe McCarthy. But I don't know if you have had a president whose actions —- in terms of dishonesty, clear dishonesty, in terms of the attacks on the media, trying to undermine people’s faith in what they see, hear, and read, and support for authoritarian regimes — I don't know if you have had a president who has put all of these characteristics together at one time.\n\nI can't remember a president who has had more authoritarian tendencies than Trump.\n\nSarah Wildman\n\nWhat role do you think the media needs to play? What happens when you undermine the Fourth Estate?\n\nTrump says, [essentially] “Hey all of these, ABC, CBS, VOX, everybody else, anybody in the mainstream media, they are all liars, they hate me, they are trying to undermine me, so don't believe a word of it.”\n\nWhat does that tell the average person in this country? Where will they get the truth?\n\nThat is a very profound development. After all, where do you get truth? How do you get truth? How do you know what is going on in Washington, DC? Is it just Trump's tweets? I think when a president says, “This is a [news] story, I disagree with it, this is why I disagree with it” — there’s nothing wrong with that. I do that every day. But to say, “Everything you are seeing in the media is a lie” — wow, that is pretty dangerous stuff.\n\nYou mentioned the National Front earlier — there was great anxiety that she had a chance to succeed, but actually, in the end, Marine Le Pen, and the far right in France, was profoundly unsuccessful. What was different there that we didn't experience here?\n\nLet’s not forget that if you had a popular vote that was announced at 11 pm on election night — [Hillary] Clinton won the popular vote by 2.9 million votes. That’s a difference. Emmanuel Macron did not go through a complicated Electoral College which allowed someone who received a minority of the votes to become president; that’s one of the differences. That’s a good discussion. Maybe we can have it another time."],[5,"Evict the President","The right of the People to petition their government for a redress of grievances shall not be infringed.\n\nPOTUS Eviction is a mail campaign to call the government's attention to many of the already established crimes by President Trump, and show Congress and the President that we demand that he either vacate the office, or be vacated from it. The pre-written letter, styled as an eviction notice (somewhat appropriately for a real estate magnate), lists already known impeachable offenses, and demands that the President vacate the premises no later than July 4, symbolically demanding the nation's freedom from pseudo-monarchial rule and foreign control. The bottom of the letter includes options to write in the names of your Congressional delegation if you wish to cc them (and we hope you will!). It takes less than $1 to play a small part in the resistance.\n\nWhile we don't expect President Trump to actually resign in response to these letters, this campaign will be an important step to increase the public pressure on Congress to acknowledge the public's disapproval of the President and our demands for his ouster. This will, at the very least, help deter Congressional Republicans from insulating the President from investigations and scrutiny. The public pressure on President Trump is also valuable. As we have seen, the President responds negatively to public pressure. The President's poor behavior in the face of criticism is having a culmulative effect that is alienating other Republicans, including his inner circle of aides. It takes many straws to break a camel's back. The goal of POTUS Eviction is to be part of the solution and continue piling on straws.\n\nThe target window for mailing is May 29 through June 2, immediately preceeding the March for Truth. By mailing at approximately the same time, copies will arrive at approximately the same time, helping to draw the Congress' and President's attention to the campaign. However, the choosing of these dates is only symbolic so it's still entirely appropriate to send your copy of the eviction notice any time afterwards. Many people have indicated that they are opting to send their letter via certified mail, in response to the President's recent claim that a certified letter has extra validity. Feel free to join them if you feel inclined.\n\nJoin us in our demand to get President Trump out of the White House, the People's House. Invite your friends to join you as well. POTUS Eviction begins May 29th. Resist and persist!"],[5,"Trump criticized for tweet on London mayor after bridge attacks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump came under fire on Sunday for criticizing London’s mayor in the aftermath of attacks in the city that killed seven people and injured at least 48 others.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump seized on comments by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who said Britons should not be alarmed to see more police in the streets after three men drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing others nearby.\n\n“At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!'” Trump tweeted.\n\n“We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don’t get smart it will only get worse,” Trump said.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for the London mayor said Khan “is busy working with the police, emergency services and the government to coordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack.”\n\n“He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump’s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police - including armed officers - on the streets,” the spokesperson said.\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” program, said he thought Trump’s tweet misrepresented what the mayor had said.\n\n“I don’t think that a major terrorist attack like this is the time to be divisive and to criticize a mayor who’s trying to organize his city’s response to this attack,” Gore, a Democrat, said.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN that it “troubles” him to see the kinds of tweets Trump has put out in the aftermath of the London attacks.\n\n‘EVIL SLAUGHTER’\n\nTrump did not mention the mayor when speaking after a gala event at Washington’s Ford’s Theatre later on Sunday, where he condemned the attacks as an “evil slaughter.”\n\nHe said the United States would do everything in its power to assist the UK in bringing those responsible to justice.\n\n“This bloodshed must end. This bloodshed will end,” Trump said, adding he would “do what is necessary” to prevent the threat from reaching the United States.\n\nIslamic State on Sunday claimed responsibility for the London attack.\n\nTrump also spoke with British Prime Minister Theresa May to offer condolences and offered Washington’s “full support,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump cited the London attacks to push his March 6 executive order that would temporarily ban entry into the United States of people from six predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe ban has been blocked in the courts and Trump’s legal team has asked the Supreme Court to reinstate it.\n\nTrump has said the travel ban is needed to protect Americans from terrorist attacks. Critics say his reasoning is flawed and assail the ban as discriminatory.\n\nSpeaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program, former Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday: “A travel ban will be cannon fodder to the recruiters. It’s the worst thing we could do.”\n\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins told the CBS program “Face the Nation” that she thought Trump’s travel ban was “not the right way to go” because it was too broad.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said it was monitoring the security situation and advised Americans in Britain to heed the advice of local authorities and maintain their security awareness.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a statement late on Saturday saying: “At this time, we have no information to indicate a specific, credible terror threat in the United States.” Law enforcement officials in major U.S. cities said they were not aware of any threats but were on alert."],[5,"On Senate Health Bill, Trump Falters in the Closer’s Role","WASHINGTON — President Trump began his all-hands meeting with Republican senators at the White House on Tuesday by saying they were “very close” to passing a health care bill, just as efforts to fast-track a vote this week collapsed.\n\nIf Republicans do manage to broker a deal — as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, pledged to do during a lively East Room back-and-forth with the president — it is not likely to be because of Mr. Trump’s involvement. Until Tuesday afternoon, the president was largely on the sidelines as the fate of one of his most important campaign pledges played out.\n\nMr. McConnell, who kept the president at a polite arm’s length while he oversaw negotiations over the bill, asked Mr. Trump to arrange the meeting with all 52 Republican senators during a morning phone call, in part to show senators the White House was in fact fully engaged, according to two people with knowledge of the call.\n\nWhen asked by reporters clustered on the blacktop outside the West Wing if Mr. Trump had command of the details of the negotiations, Mr. McConnell ignored the question and smiled blandly.\n\nMr. Trump and his staff played a critical role in persuading House Republicans to pass health care legislation in May, with the president personally calling dozens of wavering House members. But the Trump team’s heavy-handed tactics have been ineffective in the Senate, and White House officials determined that deploying Vice President Mike Pence, a former congressman with deep ties to many in the Senate, was a better bet than unleashing Mr. Trump on the half-dozen Republicans who will determine the fate of the Senate bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMr. Trump, who is fond of telling friends he is a “closer,” became more involved over the past few days, reaching out to a few reluctant conservatives like Senators Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who emerged from an Oval Office meeting on Monday saying he was more optimistic about getting to a yes.\n\n“The White House has been very involved in these discussions,” Mr. McConnell said in announcing that a vote on the bill was postponed until after the Fourth of July recess. “They’re very anxious to help.”\n\nYet over the past few weeks, the Senate Republican leadership has made it known that it would much rather negotiate with Mr. Pence than a president whose candidacy many did not even take seriously during the 2016 primaries. And some of the White House’s efforts have clearly been counterproductive.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. McConnell made clear his unhappiness to the White House after a “super PAC” aligned with Mr. Trump started an ad campaign against Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, after he said last week that he opposed the health care bill.\n\nThe majority leader — already rankled by Mr. Trump’s tweets goading him to change Senate rules to scuttle Democratic filibusters — called the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to complain that the attacks were “beyond stupid,” according to two Republicans with knowledge of the tense exchange.\n\nMr. McConnell, who has been toiling for weeks, mostly in private, to put together a measure that would satisfy hard-liners and moderates, told Mr. Priebus in his call that the assault by the group, America First, not only jeopardized the bill’s prospects but also imperiled Mr. Heller’s already difficult path to re-election.\n\nMr. McConnell and “several other” Republican senators expressed their irritation about the anti-Heller campaign during the White House meeting, according to two people, one of them a senator, who were present.\n\nThe move against Mr. Heller had the blessing of the White House, according to an official with America First, because Mr. Trump’s allies were furious that the senator would side with Nevada’s governor, Brian Sandoval, a Republican who accepted the Medicaid expansion under the health law and opposes the Republican overhaul, in criticizing the bill.\n\nAccording to the senator, the president laughed good-naturedly at the complaint and signaled that he had received the message.\n\nA few hours later, America First announced it was pausing its advertising assault against Mr. Heller, insisting it was doing so because of his willingness to come to the White House meeting with Mr. Trump.\n\nAmerica First was founded by a group of Mr. Trump’s loyalists — many of them with deep connections to Mr. Pence, including Nick Ayers, a Republican consultant who is regarded as the vice president’s top political adviser. The group compared Mr. Heller to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, and vowed a seven-figure advertising campaign against him.\n\nMr. Heller, the only Senate Republican who will face voters next year in a state carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016, is the top target for Democrats facing a Senate map with few opportunities in 2018. And there were already seven groups — a mix of health care advocacy organizations and more partisan Democratic efforts — on the air in Nevada assailing the Republican health care overhaul, according to a Republican ad buyer tracking the ad traffic.\n\nNeither Mr. McConnell’s office nor his top outside political advisers were warned about an impending attack on one of their most endangered incumbents. “They didn’t check in with anybody,” said Josh Holmes, Mr. McConnell’s former chief of staff. “There was no clearing of channels, no heads-up, nothing.”\n\nRepublican senators across the ideological spectrum have indicated their unease with the health bill. But Mr. Trump has few ties with the group, and several Republicans who remain on the fence have tangled with Mr. Trump, either during the presidential campaign or since.\n\nTop Trump lieutenants like Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, who lobbied members on the House bill, have been all but sidelined. Mr. Priebus has also played a much diminished role.\n\nMr. Pence has been far more active in seeking out Republican senators. Seema Verma, Mr. Pence’s former adviser in the Indiana Statehouse and now a top administration health care official, has also been trying to reassure senators that their states will have flexibility on Medicaid under the bill, while Mr. Pence’s former chief of staff, Marc Short, now the White House legislative affairs director, has been quarterbacking the effort from his hideaway in the Capitol.\n\nUntil Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, Mr. Trump had spoken with only a few members of the Senate, according to an administration official. The pace was nothing like the dozens of calls he made to help pass the House’s health bill, aides said.\n\nA senator who supports the bill left the meeting at the White House with a sense that the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the Senate plan — and seemed especially confused when a moderate Republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy, according to an aide who received a detailed readout of the exchange.\n\nMr. Trump said he planned to tackle tax reform later, ignoring the repeal’s tax implications, the staff member added.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr. Trump played the role of cheerleader on Twitter, encouraging his weary Republican allies to keep working.\n\n“I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare,” he wrote. “They really want to get it right, unlike OCare!”"],[5,"No Trump state visit","Dear Prime Minister,\n\nPresident Trump's mask has slipped yet again.\n\nBy re-tweeting anti-Muslim videos and promoting the hateful Britain First group he has reconfirmed his atrocious views.\n\nIt is incredibly dangerous for someone in his position of responsibility to sow such division and hatred at every turn.\n\nAnyone spreading such views should not be welcome in the UK, regardless of the office they hold.\n\nI am calling on you today to cancel President Trump's state visit.\n\nDoing so is in the best interests of the British people.\n\nKind regards,"],[5,"How to punish Trump: The world could impose a carbon tax on the U.S.","NEW YORK (Project Syndicate) — Donald Trump has thrown a hand grenade into the global economic architecture that was so painstakingly constructed in the years after World War II’s end.\n\nThe attempted destruction of this rules-based system of global governance — now manifested in Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement — is just the latest aspect of the U.S. president’s assault on our basic system of values and institutions.\n\nThe world is only slowly coming fully to terms with the malevolence of the Trump administration’s agenda. He and his cronies have attacked the U.S. press — a vital institution for preserving Americans’ freedoms, rights, and democracy — as an “enemy of the people.” They have attempted to undermine the foundations of our knowledge and beliefs — our epistemology — by labeling as “fake” anything that challenges their aims and arguments, even rejecting science itself. Trump’s sham justifications for spurning the Paris climate agreement is only the most recent evidence of this.\n\nFor millennia before the middle of the 18th century, standards of living stagnated. It was the Enlightenment, with its embrace of reasoned discourse and scientific inquiry, that underpinned the enormous increases in standards of living in the subsequent two and a half centuries.\n\nWith the Enlightenment also came a commitment to discover and address our prejudices. As the idea of human equality — and its corollary, basic individual rights for all — quickly spread, societies began struggling to eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, gender, and, eventually, other aspects of human identity, including disability and sexual orientation.\n\nThe anti-Enlightenment president\n\nTrump seeks to reverse all of that. His rejection of science, in particular climate science, threatens technological progress. And his bigotry toward women, Hispanics, and Muslims (except those, like the rulers of Gulf oil sheikhdoms, from whom he and his family can profit), threatens the functioning of American society and its economy, by undermining people’s trust that the system is fair to all.\n\nAs a populist, Trump has exploited the justifiable economic discontent that has become so widespread in recent years, as many Americans have become downwardly mobile amid soaring inequality. But his true objective — to enrich himself and other gilded rent-seekers at the expense of those who supported him — is revealed by his tax and health-care plans.\n\nTrump’s proposed tax reforms, so far as one can see, outdo George W. Bush in their regressivity (the share of the benefits that go to those at the top of the income distribution). And, in a country where life expectancy is already declining, his health-care overhaul would leave 23 million more Americans without health insurance.\n\nWhile Trump and his cabinet may know how to make business deals, they haven’t the slightest idea how the economic system as a whole works. If the administration’s macroeconomic policies are implemented, they will result in a larger trade deficit and a further decline in manufacturing.\n\nAmerica will suffer under Trump. Its global leadership role was being destroyed, even before Trump broke faith with over 190 countries by withdrawing from the Paris accord. At this point, rebuilding that leadership will demand a truly heroic effort. We share a common planet, and the world has learned the hard way that we have to get along and work together. We have learned, too, that cooperation can benefit all.\n\nManaging Trump\n\nSo what should the world do with a babyish bully in the sandbox, who wants everything for himself and won’t be reasoned with? How can the world manage a “rogue” U.S.?\n\nGermany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel gave the right answer when, after meeting with Trump and other G7 leaders last month, she said that Europe could no longer “fully count on others,” and would have to “fight for our own future ourselves.” This is the time for Europe to pull together, recommit itself to the values of the Enlightenment, and stand up to the U.S., as France’s new president, Emmanuel Macron, did so eloquently with a handshake that stymied Trump’s puerile alpha-male approach to asserting power.\n\nEurope can’t rely on a Trump-led U.S. for its defense. But, at the same time, it should recognize that the Cold War is over — however unwilling to acknowledge it America’s industrial-military complex may be. While fighting terrorism is important and costly, building aircraft carriers and super fighter planes is not the answer. Europe needs to decide for itself how much to spend, rather than submit to the dictates of military interests that demand 2% of GDP. Political stability may be more surely gained by Europe’s recommitment to its social-democratic economic model.\n\nThe world fights back\n\nWe now also know that the world cannot count on the U.S. in addressing the existentialist threat posed by climate change. Europe and China did the right thing in deepening their commitment to a green future — right for the planet, and right for the economy. Just as investment in technology and education gave Germany a distinct advantage in advanced manufacturing over a U.S. hamstrung by Republican ideology, so, too, Europe and Asia will achieve an almost insurmountable advantage over the US in the green technologies of the future.\n\nBut the rest of the world cannot let a rogue U.S. destroy the planet. Nor can it let a rogue U.S. take advantage of it with unenlightened — indeed anti-Enlightenment — “America first” policies. If Trump wants to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, the rest of the world should impose a carbon-adjustment tax on U.S. exports that do not comply with global standards.\n\nThe good news is that the majority of Americans are not with Trump. Most Americans still believe in Enlightenment values, accept the reality of global warming, and are willing to take action. But, as far as Trump is concerned, it should already be clear that reasoned debate will not work. It is time for action.\n\nJoseph E.

After the meeting, White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and National Security Agency. It has not been reported which third country was involved. The British Embassy in Washington declined to comment when contacted by The Independent.\n\n“This is code-word information,” one US official told the newspaper, a reference to one of the highest classification levels used by the American intelligence agencies. “[Trump] revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.”\n\nAfter the Postdetailed Mr Trump’s alleged actions, reaction was swift and harsh.\n\nDemocratic senator Chris Murphy called it “another in a very disturbing trend of careless behaviour by this administration”.\n\n“If this story is true, it’s another brick in the wall of a really, really troubling connection between Trump and the Russian government,” he said.\n\nThe development was the latest incident to shake Washington, still stunned by the firing of FBI Director James Comey. The White House has been scrambling to project a sense of order, after Mr Trump himself created mayhem by contradicting his own officials explanation for the firing.\n\nThe report on Monday evening said one the most concerning aspects of the slip, was that Mr Trump revealed the city in Isis territory where the US intelligence partner detected the threat. There were claims that Russia could use the information to undermine the US, or its ally.\n\nMr Trump’s national security advisor, HR McMaster, told the newspaper: “The president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organisations to include threats to aviation.”\n\nHe added: “At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.”\n\nLater, Mr McMaster told reporters in a brief statement delivered outside the White House, that the Post report was wrong and that at “at no time” were intelligence sources or methods discussed.\n\n“I was in the room. It didn't happen,” he said. \n\nDuring the election campaign, Mr Trump had often talked of the possibility of working with Russia to confront Isis. He frequently defended Russia’s military actions in Syria, disagreeing with many Western analysts to say Moscow’s role was crucial to stopping the spread of the Islamists.\n\nThe meeting in the Oval Office with Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, took place one day after the firing of Mr Comey, something Mr Lavrov had joked about.\n\nThe Postsaid during that meeting, Mr Trump went off script and began describing details about an Isis threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft.\n\nIt said that for anyone in government discussing such matters with an adversary would be illegal. As president, Mr Trump has authority to declassify government secrets, making it unlikely that his disclosures broke the law.\n\nIn his meeting with Mr Lavrov, Mr Trump was said to have boasted about his inside knowledge of the looming threat. “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,” Mr Trump reportedly said.\n\nMr Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States only learned from a key US partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence gathering method, but described how Isis was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances.\n\nMr Trump's identification of the location was seen as particularly problematic as Russia could use that detail to help identify the US ally, the newspaper said.\n\nThe Post said it was withholding most details of the plot. It quoted one former US intelligence counterterrorism official as saying: “Everyone knows this stream is very sensitive and the idea of sharing it at this level of granularity with the Russians is troubling.”\n\nSenior Republican senator John McCain called the allegations “disturbing”, if true. “We certainly don't want any president to leak classified information but the president does have the right to do that,” he added.\n\nAnother senior Republican with large experience in foreign and intelligence affairs, Senator Lindsey Graham, said: “I have no idea if it’s true. If it is, it would be very troubling. I'm not going to comment any further.”\n\nRepubican Senator Bob Corker, a staunch supporter of Mr Trump, warned that the White House “has got to do something soon to bring itself under control and in order”.\n\nSpeculation about which intelligence partner of the United States provided the information shared by the president immediately focussed to the so-called Five Eye group. This is the vital alliance which has linked Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand with the US in an iron-solid intelligence-sharing arrangement since the end of World War II.\n\nMr Trump has frequently railed against people who leak information. He said in February: \"The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy. Very un-American.\"\n\nA Russian photographer took photos of part of the meeting in the Oval Office that were then released by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency.

He even managed to squeeze in an extra plug for his upcoming appearance on the Fox network.\n\nThe congratulatory tone of the tweets are in stark contrast, however, to comments from fellow leaders, celebrities and citizens.\n\nCanadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has said he is “deeply disappointed” at the news, while France’s new president Emmanuel Macron appealed to U.S. citizens to help “make the planet great again.”"],[5,"Watergate 'pales' compared with Donald Trump, says former US intelligence chief","The infamous Watergate scandal \"pales\" in comparison to the allegations about the Trump administration's links to Russia, former United States intelligence chief James Clapper has said in an explosive set of remarks in Canberra.\n\nMr Clapper, who served as Director of National Intelligence under Barack Obama and in senior roles with Republican leaders as well, also said he would \"understand\" if US allies such as Australia withheld intelligence from American counterparts because of Mr Trump's demonstrated lack of discretion with such sensitive secrets.\n\nThe 50-year veteran of the military and the intelligence community painted a picture of disconcerting dysfunction in Washington with \"assaults on American institutions coming from both external and internal sources\" and most strikingly said the Trump-Russia links were much worse than the notorious scandal that toppled former US president Richard Nixon in the 1970s.\n\n\"I lived through Watergate. I was on active duty then in the Air Force as a young officer,\" Mr Clapper said following a speech to the National Press Club in Canberra. \"It was a scary time . . . I have to say, though, that I think you compare the two that Watergate pales really in my view compared to what we're confronting now.\"\n\nThe FBI is investigating links between the Trump team before and after the election that brought Donald Trump to the White House last November. Mr Trump fired the FBI director James Comey but Mr Comey will on Friday appear before a Congressional hearing into the affair.\n\nThe former spy boss also urged Australia to be cautious in its dealings with China, saying its attempts to interfere in Australia were comparable with Russia's intervention in US democracy in the hacking of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"I see some striking parallels between what our two countries are experiencing at the hand of these two countries,\" he said.\n\nHe said Australia should deal with China \"with both caution and confidence\" while never forgetting the importance of its own democratic institutions.\n\nMr Clapper, who is a visiting professor at the Australian National University, said he hoped US allies and partners would not withhold intelligence from Washington but said he would understand if they did. Mr Trump reportedly revealed sensitive Israeli secrets about the so-called Islamic State group in an Oval Office meeting with senior Russian officials.\n\nUS officials also angered Britain by leaking evidence in the Manchester terrorist bombing to the media.\n\n\"Australia and any other countries we share with will have to make their own judgments about that . . . I hope it doesn't happen but I could certainly understand if it did,\" he said.\n\n\"I will say that, in my 50-plus years in the intel business, I don't know of a time where we have shared more pervasively and more thoroughly than we do today and it would be a shame if that were jeopardised or set back.\"\n\nAustralia is part of the \"five eyes\" intelligence-sharing group along with the US, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. Australia is overwhelmingly a net beneficiary in such sharing with the US.\n\nMr Clapper said that while he had great faith in the strength of US institutions - which he described as being under \"assault\" from the Trump administration - he said his confidence was not unlimited.\n\n\"So the question is: How long can these assaults go on and the institutions not be irrevocably damaged? I honestly can't say.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he would look to countries like Australia to \"fill whatever void is created by the absence of US leadership\".\n\nThe bungled break-in of the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in Washington DC's Watergate building in 1972 ultimately cost the then Republican president, Mr Nixon, his job. Senior White House officials served prison terms.\n\n\"Watergate\" is regarded as the most significant crisis of modern US politics and also as the gold-standard of investigative journalism used to reveal the cover-up. Since Mr Nixon's fall in 1974, numerous scandals around the world have been tagged with the suffix \"gate\" to exaggerate their importance and terms like \"follow the money\" and \"deep throat\" have crept into the journalistic lexicon."],[5,"Trump tweets CMS report on 2 million Obamacare drop out, death spiral","President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to once again go after the Affordable Care Act, the law colloquially known as Obamacare.\n\nTrump was apparently referring to a report from the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services released Monday. The report showed the number of people that signed up for insurance through the ACA's individual insurance marketplaces but did not enact those plans, or pay their premiums.\n\n\"2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare,\" Trump tweeted. \"It is in a death spiral. Obstructionist Democrats gave up, have no answer = resist!\"\n\nAccording to CMS, 10.3 million Americans effectuated their coverage in February, meaning that they had paid their premiums to actually receive care. That was lower than the 12.2 million people that signed up for coverage during the 2016-2017 open enrollment period.\n\nCMS Director Seema Verma, echoing Trump, used the study to make the case that this showed Obamacare's shortcomings.\n\n\"Consumers are sending a clear message that cost and affordability are major factors in their decision to cancel or terminate coverage,\" Verma said in a statement.\n\nAccording to a CMS survey, the people that canceled or did not effectuate coverage typically had less financial assistance to pay for their plans and higher premiums than those who maintained their coverage.\n\nThe report also found that 46% of people who did not effectuate their coverage at all did so due to the cost of the plan.\n\nAt the same time, the report found that 49% of people who terminated their plan after paying for a month did so because they found coverage elsewhere, mainly through new employment or aging into Medicare.\n\nThe drop-off is a common theme of the exchanges in recent years, but the approach from the Trump administration to the numbers is different than in years past.\n\n\"The dropout rate is very similar to last year, with some people failing to pay their premiums or finding alternative coverage after signing up during open enrollment,\" Larry Levitt, senior vice president the Kaiser Family Foundation, told The Associated Press. \"What's new here is a new administration spinning numbers in a very different way from the last one.\"\n\nTrump is visiting Wisconsin on Tuesday, when will give a speech on the current state of healthcare in the US and meet with \"victims of Obamacare\" during his visit, the White House said."],[5,"White House defends Trump's taunting of Sadiq Khan after London Bridge attack","The White House has defended President Donald Trump’s controversial string of tweets following the recent terrorist attack in London.\n\nThe president issued several early-morning missives about the attack, in which he lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan and referred to his own proposed travel restrictions as a “travel ban”. Many accused Mr Trump of politicising the tragedy and using it to further his own aims.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, however, defended the president’s tweets, saying they allow him to “speak directly to the people without the bias of the media filtering those communications.”\n\nHours before, Mr Trump had used the social media platform to criticise Mr Khan’s calls for calm.\n\n“At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’” Mr Trump tweeted. The mayor had been referring to the increased police presence in the city.\n\nLater, Mr Trump tweeted about Mr Khan’s “pathetic excuse” for his statement, claiming the mainstream media was “working hard to sell it”.\n\nMs Sanders echoed these statements, saying the president was not “picking a fight” with Mr Khan, but that “the media wants to spin it that way”.\n\nShe also denied the accusation that the president had singled out Mr Khan because of his Muslim faith.  \n\nIn the same press conference, however, Ms Sanders defended Mr Trump’s proposed restrictions on entry for residents of six Muslim-majority countries. She adopted Mr Trump's own language from that morning, in which he referred to the restrictions as a \"travel ban\". \n\n\"One of the reasons we have the travel ban here, through this executive order, is a focus on national security,\" she said. \n\nMuch of the debate about Mr Trump's restrictions – which have been blocked by multiple federal judges – centres on whether they amount to a \"Muslim ban\". A ban on any religion by the US government would be unconstitutional. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has previously insisted that the executive order is \"not a Muslim ban\" and \"not a travel ban\".\n\nBut Ms Sanders co-opted the president's own language on Monday, referring to the order as a travel ban and denying the term was problematic.\n\n“The president isn’t concerned with what you call it, he’s concerned with national security and protecting people in this country,” Ms Sanders said.\n\nMr Trump has asked the Supreme Court to reconsider the various restraining orders on his ban."],[5,"Trump Campaign Had At Least 18 Undisclosed Contacts With Russians, Sources Say","Michael Flynn and other advisers to Donald Trump’s campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the 2016 presidential race, current and former U.S. officials familiar with the exchanges told Reuters.\n\nConversations between Flynn and Kislyak accelerated after the Nov. 8 vote as the two discussed establishing a back channel for communication between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that could bypass the U.S. national security bureaucracy, which both sides considered hostile to improved relations, four current U.S. officials said.\n\nIn January, the Trump White House initially denied any contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. The White House and advisers to the campaign have since confirmed four meetings between Kislyak and Trump advisers during that time.\n\nThe people who described the contacts to Reuters said they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion between the campaign and Russia in the communications reviewed so far. But the disclosure could increase the pressure on Trump and his aides to provide the FBI and Congress with a full account of interactions with Russian officials and others with links to the Kremlin during and immediately after the 2016 election.\n\nThe 18 calls and electronic messages took place between April and November 2016 as hackers engaged in what U.S. intelligence concluded in January was part of a Kremlin campaign to discredit the vote and influence the outcome of the election in favor of Trump over his Democratic challenger, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.\n\nMembers of the Senate and House intelligence committees have gone to the CIA and the National Security Agency to review transcripts and other documents related to contacts between Trump campaign advisers and associates and Russian officials and others with links to Putin, people with knowledge of those investigations told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday it had appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential campaign and possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia. Mueller will now take charge of the FBI investigation that began last July. Trump and his aides have repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia.\n\nBeyond Medvedchuk and Kislyak, the identities of the other Putin-linked participants in the contacts remain classified and the names of Trump advisers other than Flynn have been “masked” in intelligence reports on the contacts because of legal protections on their privacy as American citizens. However, officials can request that they be revealed for intelligence purposes.\n\nAfter Vice President Mike Pence and others had denied in January that Trump campaign representatives had any contact with Russian officials, the White House later confirmed that Kislyak had met twice with then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who later became attorney general.\n\nKislyak also attended an event in April where Trump said he would seek better relations with Russia. Senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, also attended that event in Washington. In addition, Kislyak met with two other Trump campaign advisers in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention.\n\nTrump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations with Kislyak in late December - after the Nov. 8 election and just after the Obama administration announced new sanctions on Russia. Flynn offered to testify to Congress in return for immunity from prosecution but his offer was turned down by the House intelligence committee."],[5,"Exclusive: NSA Chief Admits Donald Trump Colluded With Russia","President Donald Trump’s firing of FBI director James Comey continues to reverberate in the KremlinGate scandal, which threatens to consume the Trump administration. By abruptly removing Comey, then mangling his excuses for why he did so, Trump created a needless crisis for the White House which shows no signs of abating.\n\nThe impartial observer might think that Trump fired Comey because he feared what the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation of the president’s contacts with Russia might reveal—as the commander in chief has essentially admitted. Moreover, Trump’s inappropriate efforts to secure Comey’s personal “loyalty” had fallen flat—the FBI director rightly assured the president of his honesty but abjured any fealty to Trump personally—after which the president is reported to have developed a palpable fear of the incorruptible Bureau boss. To protect Team Trump, Comey had to go.\n\nBut cashiering Comey was insufficient. True to form, Trump seemingly took the offensive against the FBI. According to multiple reports, the president approached top intelligence bosses to coax them into joining Trump’s personal war with Comey. In particular, Trump is reported to have asked Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence (DNI), and Admiral Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, to go public in denying that Team Trump had any ties to Russia during the 2016 election campaign.\n\nThe president’s take on the FBI investigation is well known, thanks to his frequent tweets castigating it as “fake news,” a “hoax” and even a “witch hunt.” However, asking top intelligence officials to publicly attack the FBI and its director isn’t just unusual—it’s unprecedented. Even President Nixon, in the depths of the Watergate scandal, which ultimately unraveled his administration, never went quite so far as to drag NSA into his public mess.\n\nAdmiral Rogers anecdotally flatly denied Trump’s request, which—if true—was inappropriate, unethical and dubiously legal, while Coats, a Trump appointee who’s only been in the DNI job since mid-March, likewise refused to back the president against the FBI. This was a stunning setback for Trump, who seems to view our nation’s top security officials as his personal employees who ought to follow his presidential whim rather than the law and the Constitution, which all of them take an oath to defend.\n\nLast week, when he appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Coats declined to answer questions about the White House’s effort to undermine the FBI investigation of Team Trump, stating, “I don’t feel it’s appropriate to characterize discussions and conversations with the president” in open session. Presumably DNI Coats would be more forthcoming in a closed Congressional session, where classified information can be revealed.\n\nDirector Rogers, in contrast, has made no public statements about the president’s effort to enlist him in his anti-Comey campaign. This is typical of his famously tight-lipped agency—for decades, NSA was humorously said to stand for Never Say Anything—and why Trump approached Rogers is no mystery. As the nation’s signals intelligence force, NSA isn’t just the biggest source of intelligence on earth—it’s also the agency possessing the bulk of the classified information which establishes collusion between Trump and the Russians. Although whispers of such SIGINT have reached the media, the lion’s share remains hidden from public view, though it’s all known to the FBI.\n\nIf Trump could co-opt NSA in his fight with the Bureau, that would be a big win, protecting the White House from dangerous information, so it’s safe to assume that Rogers’ refusal burned Trump personally. Perhaps that’s why, early this week, Admiral Rogers took the unusual step of addressing the entire NSA workforce to tell them what transpired with the president.\n\nThis is not Rogers’ style. Indeed, his tenure as NSA’s director (called DIRNSA by insiders) has been characterized by distance from his employees, which has made things rockier than necessary. To be fair to Rogers—a career intelligence officer well equipped for his current position—when he became DIRNSA in the spring of 2014, he inherited an agency in crisis. NSA was still reeling from the disastrous Ed Snowden affair, the biggest theft of classified information in espionage history.\n\nWhile Snowden has taunted NSA with tweets sent from his Russian hideaway, more security disasters have followed. The strange case of Harold Martin, yet another rogue defense contractor who stole gigantic amounts of classified information from the agency, constituted another Snowdenesque embarrassment, even though there’s no evidence that Martin was engaged in espionage.\n\nWorse for Rogers was the theft of highly classified hacking tools from NSA by the so-called Shadow Brokers, which is widely believed to be a front for Russian intelligence. The dumping of those top-secret exploits online, after modification by rogue hackers, has resulted in worldwide cyberattacks impacting millions—yet another black mark on Rogers’ tenure as DIRNSA. In response to these very public setbacks, Rogers has seldom addressed the NSA workforce about them or much else.\n\nThis week’s town hall event, which was broadcast to agency facilities worldwide, was therefore met with surprise and anticipation by the NSA workforce, and Rogers did not disappoint. I have spoken with several NSA officials who witnessed the director’s talk and I’m reporting their firsthand accounts, which corroborate each other, on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn his town hall talk, Rogers reportedly admitted that President Trump asked him to discredit the FBI and James Comey, which the admiral flatly refused to do. As Rogers explained, he informed the commander in chief, “I know you won’t like it, but I have to tell what I have seen”—a probable reference to specific intelligence establishing collusion between the Kremlin and Team Trump.\n\nRogers then added that such SIGINT exists, and it is damning. He stated, “There is no question that we [meaning NSA] have evidence of election involvement and questionable contacts with the Russians.” Although Rogers did not cite the specific intelligence he was referring to, agency officials with direct knowledge have informed me that DIRNSA was obviously referring to a series of SIGINT reports from 2016 based on intercepts of communications between known Russian intelligence officials and key members of Trump’s campaign, in which they discussed methods of damaging Hillary Clinton.\n\nNSA employees walked out of the town hall impressed by the director’s forthright discussion of his interactions with the Trump administration, particularly with how Rogers insisted that he had no desire to “politicize” the situation beyond what the president has already done. America’s spies are unaccustomed to playing partisan politics as Trump has apparently asked them to do, and it appears that the White House’s ham-fisted effort to get NSA to attack the FBI and its credibility was a serious mistake.\n\nIt’s therefore high time for the House and Senate intelligence committees to invite Admiral Rogers to talk to them about what transpired with the White House. It’s evident that DIRNSA has something important to say. Since Mike Rogers is said to have kept notes of the president’s effort to enlist him in Trump’s personal war with the FBI, as any seasoned Beltway bureaucrat would do, his account ought to be impressively detailed.\n\nJohn Schindler is a security expert and former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer.

The three states make up about a fifth of U.S. population and GDP. They also produced 11 percent of U.S. emissions in 2014, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"If the President is going to be AWOL in this profoundly important human endeavor, then California and other states will step up,\" Gov.

It isn't pretty.\n\nThe special counsel’s investigation of the White House has come more sharply into focus.\n\nRobert Mueller is examining whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice when he fired James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Washington Post recently reported. As we've heard for months now, there is also a probe of possible collusion between Trump's campaign team and the Kremlin to tilt the 2016 election in the president's favor.\n\nBut the Justice Department inquiry led by Mueller now has added flavors. The Post noted that the investigation also includes \"suspicious financial activity\" involving \"Russian operatives.\" The New York Times was more specific in its account, saying that Mueller is looking at whether Trump associates laundered financial payoffs from Russian officials by channeling them through offshore accounts.\n\nTrump has repeatedly labeled Comey's and Mueller's investigations \"witch hunts,\" and his lawyers have said that the last decade of his tax returns (which the president has declined to release) would show that he had no income or loans from Russian sources. In May, Trump told NBC that he has no property or investments in Russia. \"I am not involved in Russia,\" he said.\n\nBut that doesn't address national security and other problems that might arise for the president if Russia is involved in Trump, either through potentially compromising U.S. business relationships or through funds that flowed into his wallet years ago. In that context, a troubling history of Trump's dealings with Russians exists outside of Russia: in a dormant real-estate development firm, the Bayrock Group, which once operated just two floors beneath the president's own office in Trump Tower.\n\nBayrock partnered with the future president and his two eldest children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, on a series of real-estate deals between 2002 and about 2011, the most prominent being the troubled Trump Soho hotel and condominium in Manhattan.\n\nDuring the years that Bayrock and Trump did deals together, the company was also a bridge between murky European funding and a number of projects in the U.S. to which the president once lent his name in exchange for handsome fees. Icelandic banks that dealt with Bayrock, for example, were easy marks for money launderers and foreign influence, according to interviews with government investigators, legislators, and others in Reykjavik, Brussels, Paris and London. Trump testified under oath in a 2007 deposition that Bayrock brought Russian investors to his Trump Tower office to discuss deals in Moscow, and said he was pondering investing there.\n\n\"It's ridiculous that I wouldn't be investing in Russia,\" Trump said in that deposition. \"Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment.\"\n\nOne of Bayrock's principals was a career criminal named Felix Sater who had ties to Russian and American organized crime groups. Before linking up with the company and with Trump, he had worked as a mob informant for the U.S. government, fled to Moscow to avoid criminal charges while boasting of his KGB and Kremlin contacts there, and had gone to prison for slashing apart another man’s face with a broken cocktail glass.\n\nIn a series of interviews and a lawsuit, a former Bayrock insider, Jody Kriss, claims that he eventually departed from the firm because he became convinced that Bayrock was actually a front for money laundering.\n\nKriss has sued Bayrock, alleging that in addition to laundering money, the Bayrock team also skimmed cash from the operation, dodged taxes and cheated him out of millions of dollars. Sater and others at Bayrock would not comment for this column; in court documents they have contested Kriss's charges and describe him, essentially, as a disgruntled employee trying to shake them down.\n\nBut Kriss's assertion that Bayrock was a criminal operation during the years it partnered with Trump has been deemed plausible enough to earn him a court victory: In December, a federal judge in New York said Kriss's lawsuit against Bayrock, which he first filed nine years ago, could proceed as a racketeering case.\n\n(I have my own history in court with the president. Trump sued me in 2006 when I worked at the New York Times, alleging that my biography, “TrumpNation,” had misrepresented his business record and his wealth. Trump lost the suit in 2011; my lawyers deposed him and Sater during the litigation. Trump's representatives didn't respond to repeated interview requests for this column.)\n\nTrump has said over the years that he barely knows Sater. In fact, Sater — who former Bayrock employees say met frequently with Trump in the Trump Organization's New York headquarters, once shepherded the president's children around Moscow and carried a Trump Organization business card — apparently has remained firmly in the orbit of the president and his closest advisers.\n\nSater made the front page of the New York Times in February for his role in a failed effort — along with Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen — to lobby former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on a Ukrainian peace proposal.\n\nComey was still Trump's FBI director when he testified before the House Intelligence Committee in March about Russian interference in the 2016 election. During that hearing, Comey was asked if he was \"aware of\" Felix Sater, his criminal history and his business dealings with the Trump Organization. Comey declined to comment.\n\nIt's unclear whether Sater and Bayrock are part of Mueller's investigation. But Mueller has populated his investigative team with veteran prosecutors expert in white-collar fraud and Russian-organized-crime probes. One of them, Andrew Weissmann, once led an FBI team that examined financial fraud leading to the demise of Enron. Before that, Weissmann was a prosecutor with the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn and part of a team that prosecuted Sater and mob associates for investment scams in the late 1990s.\n\nHowever the Mueller probe unfolds, a tour of Trump's partnership with Bayrock exposes a number of uncomfortable truths about the president's business history, his judgment, and the possible vulnerabilities that his past as a freewheeling dealmaker — and his involvement with figures like Sater — have visited upon his present as the nation's chief executive.\n\nSater was born in the Soviet Union in 1966 and emigrated with his parents to the heavily Russian enclave of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, when he was about eight years old. He attended Pace University before dropping out when he was 18, then found his way to Wall Street where he worked as a stockbroker.\n\nHis early years on Wall Street, according to the recollections of his one-time business partner, Salvatore Lauria, were flush. By his mid-20s, Sater was collecting expensive watches, spending thousands of dollars on Zegna suits and buying luxury cars. That all came to a brief halt in 1993 when he was sent to prison for using the stem of a broken margarita glass during a bar fight two years earlier to attack another stockbroker; Sater’s victim needed 110 stitches to hold his face together.\n\nWhen Sater emerged from prison 15 months later, he found his way back into trouble. With a group that included Lauria (who admits to having had ties to organized crime figures and grew up in New York as a close friend of a prominent Mafia boss), Sater opened an investment firm on the penthouse floor of 40 Wall Street, a Trump-owned building in Manhattan. From there, according to federal prosecutors, Sater and his team set about laundering money for the mob and fleecing about $40 million from unwitting and largely elderly investors, a number of whom were Holocaust survivors.\n\nBy the time law enforcement authorities eventually caught on to the 40 Wall Street operation, Sater had fled to Russia. Lauria visited him there.\n\nSater \"was always hustling and scheming, and his contacts in Russia were the same kind of contacts he had in the United States,\" Lauria wrote in a 2003 memoir, \"The Scorpion and the Frog.\" \"The difference was that in Russia his crooked contacts were links between Russian organized crime, the Russian military, the KGB, and operatives who played both ways, or sometimes three ways.\"\n\nSater, who had been charged with racketeering and money laundering by the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn in connection with the 40 Wall Street scam, eventually decided to return to America and face those charges. He had a card to play, however: his knowledge, gleaned from contacts in Russia, about a small stock of Stinger antiaircraft missiles loose on the black market in Afghanistan that were of interest to U.S. intelligence officials.\n\n\"We were hoping for a free ride or a get-out-of-jail-free card for our crimes on Wall Street,\" Lauria wrote of Sater's maneuvering with U.S. officials.\n\nSater told authorities that he could use his Russian contacts to buy the Stingers and, according to court filings in Kriss's lawsuit and other accounts, a deal was struck in December 1998. Sater pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges and then entered into a cooperation agreement with the government that sealed court records in the case and allowed his sentencing to be postponed for 11 years. (Sater would ultimately only pay a $25,000 fine and never go to prison.)\n\nMany years later, as part of her confirmation hearings to become President Barack Obama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch would note that the cooperation deal she made with Sater when she was the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn lasted for a decade — from 1998 to 2008 — and that Sater gave the government \"information crucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra.\"\n\nAt some point after becoming an informant, Sater also recast himself as a real-estate savant. He made his way to a Manhattan real-estate investment firm, APC Realty, where he raised money for deals and where he met Kriss in 2000.\n\nKriss, a native of Miami and a business graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, was an aspiring real-estate developer who was in his early 20s when they met. He says he was initially captivated by Sater.\n\n“Felix knew how to be charming and he knew how to be brutally nasty,” says Kriss. “He has a talent for drawing people in. He has charm and charisma. But that’s what con men do.”\n\nAfter APC began to fall apart in 2002, Kriss decided to strike out on his own back home in Miami, doing real-estate deals. Sater made his way to a small Hong Kong investment bank that used him as a New York-based rainmaker for real-estate deals.\n\nIn addition to his new life as a real-estate investor and government informant, Sater owned a comfortable home in Sands Point, Long Island, a toney New York suburb that was a setting for “The Great Gatsby.” He also had a wife and three daughters and was a member of an Orthodox synagogue in neighboring Port Washington. On one occasion Sater brought his rabbi with him to meet U.S. intelligence officials in New York, where, the rabbi said, agents praised Sater's service to the country.\n\nWhen Sater received a community service award at his synagogue on another occasion, a band played \"Hail to the Chief.\" Sater gave an acceptance speech in which he noted that he was \"not a very religious person\" but that his goal in life was to \"repair the world or make it a better place.\"\n\nAbout a year after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Sater joined Bayrock, a company that marketed itself as a property developer and had opened Manhattan offices on the 24th floor of a well-known building at 725 Fifth Avenue: Trump Tower.\n\nIn late 2002, Sater phoned Kriss and invited him to consult at Bayrock, bragging about a deep-pocketed investor, Tevfik Arif, who was partnering with him in search of bigger deals.\n\nArif, born in Kazakhstan, was a former Soviet official who had relocated to Turkey to make his fortune. He ran several upscale, seaside hotels there that catered almost exclusively to Russians, according to Kriss, and he had also redeveloped a shopping center in Brooklyn. At one point in his post-Soviet years, Arif also reportedly took over a former Kazakh state-owned chromium producer with his brother.\n\nLike Sater, Arif had a home in Sands Point and Kriss says that Arif brought his children there from Turkey to learn English. (Arif's representatives declined to respond to a list of questions about his business history, including how he met Sater and brought him to Bayrock, citing ongoing litigation.)\n\nBayrock was initially funded, in part, with a $10 million investment transferred to the firm by Arif's brother in Russia, who, according to Kriss's lawsuit, was able to tap into the cash reserves of a Kazakh chromium refinery. (A spokeswoman for Arif declined to comment on that allegation.)\n\nA marketing document Bayrock once circulated to prospective investors noted that Alexander Mashkevich, an oligarch born in the former Soviet Union, was one of Bayrock's primary sources of funding. Mashkevich's firm, the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, was based in Kazakhstan and elsewhere and had interests in chromium, aluminum, coal, construction, and banking. (A person close to Mashkevich, who requested anonymity because of the Kriss-Bayrock litigation, said Mashkevich never invested in Bayrock.)\n\nBayrock never seemed to be short of money, however. According to Kriss’s lawsuit, the team running the little development firm in Trump Tower could locate funds \"month after month, for two years, in fact more frequently, whenever Bayrock ran out of cash.\" If times got tight, Bayrock's owners would \"magically show up with a wire from 'somewhere' just large enough to keep the company going.\"\n\nKriss says that Sater and Arif wooed him to Bayrock by offering him 10 percent of the firm's profits. Bayrock’s Trump Tower offices gave “an air of success to it,” Kriss says. Bayrock also gave Kriss, then 28 years old, the opportunity to work with Trump.\n\nIt was Sater who initially developed the relationship with Trump, according to Kriss and court records from Trump's lawsuit against me. Sater had made the acquaintance of three Trump Organization executives who then introduced him to their boss. When the Bayrock team met Trump in 2002, the future president was enduring a long stretch in the financial wilderness, having narrowly escaped personal bankruptcy in the early 1990s.\n\nHe eventually emerged from that mess as a pariah among big banks. He was also a determined survivor and tireless self-promoter and he parlayed those skills into recreating himself as a branding machine and golf course developer in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nKriss says that it was Arif and Sater who pitched the future president on the idea of launching an international chain of Trump-branded, mixed-use hotels and condominiums. And Bayrock got to Trump at a time when his “brand” could help get a little extra attention for a condo project, but didn’t amount to much more than that.\n\n“Trump was trying to build his brand and Bayrock was trying to market it,” Kriss recalls. “It wasn’t clear who needed each other more. This was before the show, remember.”\n\nThe “show,” of course, was “The Apprentice.” It aired for the first time on Jan. 8, 2004, and became a sensation that vaulted Trump into reality TV stardom. In the real world, Trump's casinos were faltering. But on reality TV, Trump posed as a successful leader and dealmaker who embodied a certain kind of entrepreneurial flair and over-the-top billionairedom — an impression that stuck with tens of millions of TV viewers.\n\nThe popularity of \"The Apprentice\" also gave the Bayrock-Trump partnership added zing.\n\n“That put Bayrock in a great position once the show debuted,” Kriss says. “The show did it for Trump, man. Nobody was interested in licensing his name before that.”\n\nThe hook at Bayrock, for Trump, was an 18 percent equity stake in what became the Trump Soho hotel, a steady stream of management fees on all Bayrock projects and the ability to plaster his name on properties without having to invest a single dollar of his own.\n\nIt’s not clear how carefully Trump vetted his Bayrock partners. But his lack of concern about their backgrounds — and the potential risk to his own reputation from dealing with them — was part of a pattern. In Atlantic City, he had partnered with men with organized crime ties. Later, he and his children struck deals in Brazil and Azerbaijan with partners who had murky backgrounds or unusual legal entanglements.\n\nSater said in court filings that he disclosed his securities fraud conviction to members of the Trump Organization. He assumed they had told Trump, but he wasn't sure.\n\n\"It's not very hard to get connected to Donald if you make it known that you have a lot of money and you want to do deals and you want to put his name on it,\" Abe Wallach, who was the future president's right-hand man at the Trump Organization from 1990 to about 2002, told me in an interview. \"Donald doesn't do due diligence. He relies on his gut and whether he thinks you have good genes.\"\n\nGiven Arif's halting English, it was Sater and Kriss who interacted most frequently with the Trump family—and Sater the most often with Trump himself. Kriss says that most of his own contacts were with the elder Trump children, Don Jr. and Ivanka, and included drafting contracts and occasional nights on the town.\n\nWhile Trump’s kids were involved in the back-and-forth with Bayrock, it was Trump himself who always had the final say.\n\n“Donald was always in charge,” says Kriss. “Donald had to agree to every term of every deal and had to sign off on everything. Nothing happened unless he said it was okay to do it. Even if Donald Jr., shook your hand on a deal, he came back downstairs to renegotiate if his father told him to.”\n\nThe Trumps, Kriss says, saw Sater \"frequently\" and valued the relationship because “Felix demonstrated that he was loyal to them.” He says that at one point Sater was meeting with the future president in his Trump Tower office multiple times a week. Sater, according to a later court deposition, said that his business conversations with Trump in that office were wide-ranging and frequent — “on a constant basis.\"\n\nThe pair had what Sater described as \"real-estate conversations,\" and they talked about \"gathering intelligence, gathering know-how, general market discussions,\" and also chatted about using Sater's Russian connections to build a \"high-rise, center of Moscow” that would be a “great opportunity, megafinancial home run.\"\n\nAlthough Sater socialized with Trump, \"I wouldn't call him my friend,\" he said in the 2008 deposition. Still, Sater said he traveled with Trump to look at deals and was proud of Bayrock's relationship with the famous developer. \"Anybody can come in and build a tower,\" he said. \"I can build a Trump Tower because of my relationship with Trump.\"\n\nBayrock and the Trumps then began laying the groundwork for domestic and international hotel-condo projects, eventually exploring deals in Turkey, Poland and Ukraine. Sater escorted Ivanka and Don Jr. on a trip to Moscow, where they looked at land for a Trump-branded hotel.\n\nNone of those overseas projects got past the planning stages. In the U.S., Bayrock and Trump projects moved forward haltingly.\n\nIn Phoenix, a one-story mall that Bayrock bought out of bankruptcy was meant to be the site of a Trump-branded tower. It became ensnared in zoning debates and then the national real-estate downturn and never got built.\n\nSater's dealings in Phoenix later landed him in court with a local developer who had invested in the Phoenix project, Ernest Mennes. Mennes said in a lawsuit that when he threatened to reveal Sater's criminal record, Sater told him that he would have a cousin \"electrically shock Mr. Mennes’ testicles, cut off Mr. Mennes’ legs, and leave Mr. Mennes dead in the trunk of his car.\"\n\nIn Mennes's suit against Bayrock and Sater, he alleged that Sater also skimmed money from the Phoenix development. Bayrock and Sater settled the suit (which was later sealed and its terms left undisclosed; Sater's lawyer, in an interview with ABC News, denied Mennes's allegations).\n\nThe next project Trump and Bayrock pursued was the Trump International Hotel and Tower, a mixed-use hotel and condominium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Announced in 2005, it later went into foreclosure.\n\nThe third and final major project Bayrock and Trump worked on together was their most high-profile effort, the 46-story Trump Soho hotel in lower Manhattan.\n\nTrump, Sater and Arif were all photographed together at a splashy launch party for the Trump Soho in 2007. Trump also pitched the Trump Soho on an episode of \"The Apprentice,\" promising that \"this brilliant, $370 million work of art will be an awe-inspiring masterpiece.\"\n\nHelping Trump and Bayrock fund that masterpiece was a fresh influx of money from an Icelandic investment bank called the FL Group. Sater and Lauria, his longtime mob associate, had jointly recruited FL, introducing the firm to Bayrock and the Trump Organization. (I’ll have more on the FL Group and Bayrock in a future column; the firm's former leaders, one of whom was later convicted of tax and accounting fraud, declined to comment or did not respond to interview requests for this column.)\n\nYet again, the Trump Organization — even though it signed off on the FL investment — appeared to care little about vetting a firm that came into the partnership through Sater. FL operated in a country with a porous, vulnerable banking system, and some investigators who scrutinized other Icelandic banks at the time said they suspected those banks of being conduits — unwitting or otherwise — for dirty funds from outside Iceland. (The FL Group collapsed a little over a year after it invested in Bayrock. The firm itself was never prosecuted; the leaders of a number of other Icelandic banks were prosecuted or jailed for crimes including money laundering). \n\nKriss said in an interview that an Icelandic competitor of the FL Group also contacted him to invest in Bayrock. When he took that offer to Sater and Arif they told him, he says, that the money behind Icelandic banks “was mostly Russian” — and that they had to take FL’s funds for deals they were doing with Trump because the investment firm was “closer to Putin.\"\n\n“I thought it was a lie or a joke when they said Putin,” Kriss recalls. “I didn’t know how to make sense of it at all.”\n\n(Kriss says he doesn't have financial records showing that Russian President Vladimir Putin had a connection to the FL Group and that his own knowledge is purely anecdotal. A Kremlin spokesman said via email that Putin had no connection to the FL Group or Bayrock.)\n\nKriss says that in the wake of the FL deal he was owed a payout that could have ranged from about $4 million to $10 million, but that Bayrock reneged. When he persisted, he claims, Sater threatened him.\n\nSo Kriss says he accepted a $500,000 payment instead and then eventually quit. Sater, as it turns out, didn’t have much time left at Bayrock either.\n\nIn December 2007, the New York Times published an article detailing some of Sater’s past run-ins with the law and some of his ties to organized crime (the article also noted that Sater had begun using “Satter” as an alternate spelling for his last name so he could try to “distance himself from his past” if people Googled him).\n\nTwo days after the Times story ran, Trump sat for a deposition with my attorneys as part of the libel lawsuit he had filed against me for “TrumpNation.” They asked him whether he planned to sever his relationship with Sater because of Sater's organized crime ties. Trump said he hadn't made up his mind.\n\n\"Have you previously associated with people you knew were members of organized crime?\" one of my lawyers asked.\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" Trump responded. \"And it's hard to overly blame Bayrock. Things like that can happen. But I want to see what action Bayrock takes before I make a decision.\" (In fact, Trump had partnered in the past in Atlantic City's real-estate business with men he knew were mobbed up.)\n\nWhenever he was asked in later years about his relationship with Sater, Trump routinely misrepresented it as distant. In a 2013 deposition taken as part of litigation surrounding Trump and Bayrock’s failed Fort Lauderdale project, Trump was asked again about his partnership with Sater.\n\n\"He was supposedly very close to the government of the United States as a witness or something,\" Trump said. \"I don't think he was connected to the Mafia. He got into trouble because he got into a barroom fight.\"\n\n\"I don't know him very well,\" Trump added, saying that he hadn't conversed very often with Sater. \"If he were sitting in the room right now I really wouldn't know what he looked like.\"\n\nTrump also said that he didn't think that questions about Sater’s background meant that he should have ended his business partnership with him: “Somebody said that he is in the Mafia. What am I going to do?”\n\nShortly after my lawyers asked Trump about Sater, Bayrock began discussing the best way for him to resign, according to company email and court records. By 2008, Sater had left the firm.\n\nThe Trump Soho ended in failure. It opened in 2010, but many units failed to sell and early condo purchasers sued Bayrock and the Trumps. Three years later, the Trump Soho went into foreclosure with most of its units still unsold, and a new company took control of the property. Bayrock hasn’t done another deal since then. (A spokeswoman for Bayrock attributed the failures of the Trump partnerships to fallout from the 2008 financial meltdown.)\n\nAfter Kriss left Bayrock, he set up his own development firm in New York and then sued Sater, Arif, Trump and Bayrock in Delaware in 2008, alleging that Bayrock was a criminal enterprise and demanding to be paid in full for his work there.\n\nWhen the case moved to New York in 2010, it came with a twist. Sater had left a copy of his cooperation deal with the government – the one dating back to his Stinger missile and mob informant days – on the hard drive of his Bayrock computer. A Bayrock employee leaked it to Kriss’s attorney, who promptly filed it as an exhibit in court.\n\nTrump was eventually dropped from the case and Sater began carpet-bombing Kriss with his own lawsuits, ultimately filing several separate actions that claimed, among other things, that Kriss has used the courts to prosecute him maliciously.\n\nSater also apparently kept busy outside of the courtroom.\n\nKriss says that about three years ago he started receiving threatening email from websites carrying versions of his name (“JKrissInfo.com,” for example). He soon discovered there were hundreds of other new websites that also contained false, disparaging information about him.\n\nKriss sued the anonymous authors of the websites for defamation and when the court ruled in his favor he was able to get a large portion of the sites delisted from Google. He says he also was able to use the court order to untangle the provenance of the websites, discovering that their registration tracked back to Sater’s home address in Sands Point.\n\nKriss says that goons once showed up at real-estate developments he was overseeing in Brooklyn, asking his employees if they knew the true story about their boss. Waves of letters questioning his bona fides have arrived at his office and in the mailboxes of every resident in two separate buildings where Kriss kept apartments.\n\nKriss says investors in his new company, East River Partners, have stood by him, but he's worried that Sater's digital vendetta may be hard to overcome. His new lawyer, Bradley D. Simon, says that he's mystified by how Sater has managed to stay afloat all these years.\n\n“Sater was a cooperating witness for the Eastern District of New York and he continued going on a crime rampage,” says Simon. “He’s filed all kinds of frivolous lawsuits, but that’s what he does. He seems to have unlimited funds.”\n\nFor his part, Sater continues to wear many hats. A couple of years after he left Bayrock, the Trump Organization hired him briefly as a consultant to prospect for real-estate deals, giving him company business cards with his name engraved on them.\n\nMore recently, Sater got enmeshed in litigation again, this time around the sale of an Ohio shopping mall — and the alleged disappearance of tens of millions of dollars — in a court case that was settled in 2013.\n\nSater has also entered into a war of words with his former Bayrock partner, Tevfik Arif. Sater claims, according to a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, that Arif owes him money — and that if he isn't paid he'll publicize what he describes as Arif's ties to organized crime and to tainted dealings in Kazakhstan’s metals business. (A Bayrock spokeswoman says that Sater's claims about Arif are baseless.)\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is mired in a probe that now pivots off sensitive topics for him and his family: their money, their deals and Russia – all of which will test his promise to testify under oath to Mueller and his investigators."],[5,"Paul Ryan Defends Donald Trump After Comey Hearing","Paul Ryan is a very good actor. The Speaker of the House has staked his reputation, and his campaigns, on being a wonky, thoughtful Republican, conservative to be sure but a man of integrity, driven by careful consideration.\n\nIt's a great cover for a man without a spine.\n\nYesterday, after former FBI director James Comey's damning congressional testimony – Comey said the president pressed him to back off his bureau's investigation into Trump team ties with Russia; Comey was also fired by the president – Ryan held a press conference wherein he made excuses for the beleaguered kleptocrat-in-chief, saying perhaps Trump is in this mess of his own making because \"he's just new to this\" and perhaps didn't know the appropriate protocol.\n\nWell, there's one reason among a thousand not to put an inexperienced buffoon in office. The president of the United States should not be \"new to this\" when \"this\" includes the basic duties and obligations of the office. And even a very inexperienced but basically competent president would listen to the instructions given to him; Trump notoriously has the attention span of a baby gnat, so easily distracted and unable to digest any more than the most simplistic information that our NATO allies were instructed to give him the Cliffs Notes version of international relations.\n\nAnd of course, as former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, another well-regarded civil servant fired by Trump, pointed out, the president found ample time in his campaign to criticize former president Bill Clinton for meeting with then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch while his wife, Hillary Clinton, was running for president. How could he have identified that as a breach of protocol with at least the perception of a serious ethical problem, but not his own actions?\n\nTrump, we know, plays by his own set of rules, or simply doesn't believe the rules apply to him at all. But why is Paul Ryan defending him? Why would Ryan suggest it's OK that Trump doesn't know something he clearly does – and clearly should?\n\nThis is the same Paul Ryan who, just a few months ago, proudly put forward a bill that would allow states to mandate drug testing for anyone receiving federal unemployment benefits – fail and lose necessary financial assistance to keep you afloat while you're looking for work. \"I'm new to this\" probably won't fly in the unemployment office when a newly unemployed person is getting kicked off the rolls for smoking a joint three weeks ago; why should it be an excuse for the person holding the highest executive office in the country violating what are clear and crucial basic protocols?\n\nRyan's defense of Trump is pathetic. And it's been pathetic. During the campaign, Trump habitually insulted Ryan, calling him \"a man who doesn't know how to win (including a failed run four years ago)\" and \"very weak and ineffective.\" But when Ryan was asked in July 2016 how he could support a candidate “who is openly racist and has said Islamophobic statements, wants to shut down our borders,” he responded, “That basically means you’re going to help elect Hillary Clinton,” as if hatred and bigotry are OK if the end result is getting your party elected. Remember this is the same Ryan who said Trump's attack on a federal judge was the \"textbook definition of a racist comment,\" but did not pull his endorsement. Then, after the now-famous video of Trump bragging about grabbing women by the pussy surfaced and several women accused Trump of sexual harassment and assault, Ryan, a champion of traditional family values, tried to gingerly distance himself by announcing he would no longer defend the then-nominee, but still, he refused to pull his endorsement.\n\nLooks like he's back to defending Trump.\n\nJust like the potential of the GOP winning the election was more important than taking a principled stand against a man who stood accused of, and himself bragged about, sexual assault, maintaining GOP power is apparently still more important than taking a principled stand for independent investigative agencies – and for a presidency where the leader of the free world isn't thought to be either beholden or cozied up to a hostile foreign power, nor using his office to enrich himself and his family.\n\nAll of this even though Trump has no problem throwing Ryan under the bus when it suits him. After the GOP’s first failed attempt to repeal Obamacare this year, Trump tweeted that his followers should watch Judge Jeanine Pirro on Fox. Pirro then opened her show calling for Ryan to step down as Speaker. Of course Sean Spicer insisted it was just a coincidence and Trump was just \"a fan of the show.”And then like a good lapdog, Ryan echoed that sentiment. “He actually was very apologetic,” Ryan said. “He said, 'I had no idea she was going to talk about that. I thought she was going to talk about something else.'”\n\nRyan is not a stupid person. And even though I find his politics abhorrent, he has gone out of his way to pitch himself as a fundamentally decent, principled man who believes in the American system of democratic governance.\n\nThanks to Trump, it's now obvious that Ryan isn't any kind of upstanding man; he's a spineless, transparent little jellyfish. Kudos to him, though – he had a lot of us fooled. And it was a good act while it lasted.\n\nFollow Jill on Twitter."],[5,"The Genius of Trump’s Tweets","President Donald Trump frequently comes under criticism for tweeting, even from his own advisers. But tweeting is probably the smartest thing he has done as president. He is able to speak directly to the American people without going through the biased mainstream media filter. The media doesn’t get to ask him slanted questions or pick and choose parts of his press releases to publish. Instead, Trump gets immense control over every single sentence he issues, which are then read by millions of Americans.\n\nWith almost everyone online these days, it is easy for the average American to follow Trump’s tweets on Twitter. Twitter is free, unlike some mainstream media sites. Many of The Washington Post’s articles — the site is a frequent critic of Trump — are behind a paywall. A Twitter account isn’t even required in order to view Trump’s tweets. And even if left-leaning Twitter artificially buries positive news about Trump, it doesn’t matter, people go directly to his tweets.\n\nGoogle, Twitter and Facebook control much of the news we see today, but Trump’s tweets get around their dominance. Similar to the Drudge Report website, Trump’s tweets are so well-known that people view his tweets independently of the tech giants. The Drudge Report receives comparable traffic to Google News and The New York Times — despite the fact Google News prominently promotes the Times in search results and on its homepage. Drudge isn’t even carried in Google News, since the site merely aggregates links to articles. Google is the most trafficked site in the U.S. as well as in the world.\n\nMost of the time, Google News is full of articles by the left-leaning media critical of Trump and conservatism. But Trump’s tweets changed all that. Reporters race to report on his tweets, filling up Google News with articles that are far more favorable to Trump, since there is so little room left for spin with his tweets. A quick perusal of Google News right now reveals this headline near the top, “Trump accuses Clinton of colluding with Democrats to defeat ‘Crazy Bernie Sanders.’” The Washington Post article acknowledges, “Trump took to Twitter Sunday morning…” There really is very little way to write the headline to make Trump look bad. There wasn’t any extra information to glean something from outside of one short tweet.\n\nOne sign of Trump’s success at tweeting may be diminishing references to the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia to influence the U.S. presidential election. Trump rails on Twitter frequently about the “fake news” media making up his ties to Russia. Although no evidence of collusion has emerged during the months the left-leaning media has made it a top story, the media ran with it for quite a long time. But Trump kept hammering the media over it, never letting up, sometimes with multiple tweets in a row. Finally, after fired FBI Director James Comey told Congress earlier this month that there was no collusion, the media showed signs of backing off. On June 22, CNN retracted a story. Rank-and-file Democrats in Congress are now urging leadership to stop talking about it.\n\nTrump’s tweets repeatedly labeling the mainstream media as fake news, combined with banning their journalists from news events or ignoring them at press conferences when they ask questions, is gradually chipping away at their dominance. Trump attacks CNN probably more than any other news site. Its website traffic has gradually decreased over the past year. In contrast, Breitbart, which is considered by some to be the number one pro-Trump news site, saw a steep increase in traffic right before Trump became president, which has remained at that level. Unlike CNN, Breitbart does not receive top favorable placement by Google News.\n\nTrump’s advisers continue to pressure him to stop tweeting. They are concerned that without a filter, he may tweet something reckless that could harm him. But so far he’s tweeted several things that critics contend were terrible — yet they bounced right off of him. When Trump tweets things that seem inaccurate, he generally clarifies or corrects them later. Critics are exaggerating the negative aspects of his tweets. But the public has the ability to read his tweets unfiltered and can see through the spin. Additionally, it helps that Trump is funny. He’s spent years in entertainment and knows how to drop clever one-liners. He keeps people engaged and coming back. His tweets often receive over 100,000 likes. Consequently, Trump is still fairly well-liked — despite misleading approval polls — which contributed to his ability to accomplish more during his first 100 days in office than any previous president since World War II.\n\nTrump tweeted in 2013, “Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.” It may have been arrogant, but his success with Twitter has proven his tweeting is sheer genius. He will go down in history as the president who figured out how to get around much of the biased media and talk 24/7 directly to the American people."],[5,"Kellyanne's husband scolds Trump for tweets on travel ban","George Conway, husband of Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway, scolded President Trump for tweeting about the travel ban, suggesting the president's messages could derail a future Supreme Court case.  \n\n'These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won't help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad,' Conway tweeted Monday, using one of Trump's favorite expressions. \n\nEarly Monday morning, Trump sent out a flurry of tweets about the travel ban, including one that Conway found to be especially troublesome for the office of the solicitor general, which would defend the controversial executive order if the Supreme Court takes up the case. \n\nScroll down for video  \n\n'The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.,' Trump wrote, abbreviating Supreme Court. \n\nConway specifically pointed to this tweet when he called Trump's actions 'Sad.' \n\nTrump also wrote, 'People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!'\n\n'The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!' the president also recommended. \n\nConway, an attorney who recently took himself out of the running for a top DOJ post, pointed to a piece in the Washington Post to back up his thinking.\n\nRight now, lawyers suing the government over the travel ban, and those defending it, are working on the arguments that they'll file with the Supreme Court next week. \n\nDuring the appellate level hearings, Trump's comments – along with those of his advisers – have been pointed to by the judges who have stalled the ban. \n\nThey have determined that the president's words show that the ban is intended to discriminate against Muslims. \n\nDuring the campaign, Trump had called for a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,' a statement that remained on his campaign website until recently. \n\nJustice Department lawyers have been trying to differentiate between the comments Trump made during the campaign and then as president, as Trump has signed two executive orders banning travel from seven, and then six, Muslim-majority countries. \n\nTrump's new tweets, the Washington Post's piece pointed out, will likely be added to the arguments headed to the Supreme Court.  \n\nWhile George Conway was shaking a finger at Trump's Twitter behavior, his wife was on the Today show mocking the media's 'obsession' with her boss' tweets.    \n\nMonday afternoon she took to Twitter to better explain her point.  \n\n'Never said ignore tweets – said \"This obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter &  very little to what he does as POTUS,' she said. \n\n'Just today at White House: major infrastructure/air traffic control reform, veterans reform, small businesswomen harmed by Obamacare,' Conway added, responding to a tweet from CNN's Chris Cillizza that equated a 'presidential tweet' with a 'presidential statement.'  \n\nGeorge Conway tried cleaning up his original message too, once news networks began reporting on what he said.   \n\n'Just to be clear, and in response to inquiries, I still VERY, VERY STRONGLY support POTUS, his Admin, policies, the executive order  and of course, my wonderful wife,' he wrote. 'Which is why I said what I said this morning.' \n\n'Every sensible lawyer in WHCO and every political appointee at DOJ [would] agree with me (as some have already told me),' he continued. \n\n'The [point] cannot be stressed enough that tweets on legal matters seriously undermine Admin agenda and POTUS--and those who support him, as I do, need to reinforce that [point] and not be shy about it,' Conway added. \n\nPushing back on what George Conway said, Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders answered 'not at all' when asked by a reporter if the president was concerned that he may be 'tainting the waters of the legal system' with these tweets. \n\n'The president is very focused on exactly what that order spells out, and that's protecting Americans, protecting national security, and he has every Constitutional authority to do that through that executive order, and he maintains that and that position hasn't changed in the slightest,' Huckabee Sanders said. \n\nLater, Huckabee Sanders was asked if the president's tweets were being vetted by a lawyer. \n\n'Not that I'm aware of,' she replied.  "],[5,"Bombshell: Initial Thoughts on the Washington Post’s Game-Changing Story","The Washington Post this afternoon published a stunning story reporting that President Trump disclosed highly-classified information to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during their visit to the Oval Office last week.\n\nAccording to the Post,\n\nThe Post reports that according to U.S. intelligence officials, the “disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State.”  A U.S. official stated that “This is code-word information,” and added that Trump “revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.”  Officials fear that Trump’s identification of the city location risks Russia’s being able to identify the U.S. ally or intelligence capabilities which “could be useful for other purposes, possibly providing intelligence on Russia’s presence in Syria. Moscow and would be keenly interested in identifying that source and possibly disrupting it.” \n\nReuters, which has confirmed the story, provides more details on the nature of the intelligence at issue, corroborating the Post’s reporting that Trump’s conversation disclosed information about “an Islamic State terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft”:\n\nDeputy national security advisor Dina Powell has denied the story as false. Notably, national security advisor General H.R. McMaster limited his denial to the fact that, “At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.” Likewise, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has denied disclosure of any information on “sources, methods or military operations.” These are both very carefully worded statements that leave open the possibility that classified information was disclosed other than sources and methodsor that classified information was disclosed which might be used as a basis to infer sources and methods not directly disclosed. Typically, policies related to the safeguarding of classified information treat both sources and methods information and information pertaining to or related to sources and methods in the same category.\n\nIn a hastily-convened press conference outside the White House, McMaster further stated:\n\nAgain, this statement is carefully worded. The declaration that the story “as reported” is untrue leaves plenty of room for the administration to pinpoint discrepancies in the Poststory without denying the substance. And once again, McMaster does not deny that an egregious breach of national security information was revealed, merely that “intelligence sources or methods [were] discussed” and that the President “disclose[d] any military operations that were not publicly known.” The Post’s Greg Miller, one of the two reporters who broke the story, accused the White House of “playing word games” in response to McMaster’s press conference. And indeed, if McMaster meant to be denying that anything harmful was said in the Oval Office, then it is hard to understand why (as the Post reports) “senior White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and the National Security Agency,” or why the Post agreed not to publish certain details of the plot discussed in the Oval Office after “officials” warned that doing so would “jeopardize important intelligence capabilities.\"\n\nThere may be disclosures yet to come. According to one current U.S. official quoted in Buzzfeed, the situation is “far worse than what has already been reported.” The New York Timeswrites that “sharing the information without the express permission of the ally who provided it ... could jeopardize a crucial intelligence-sharing relationship.”\n\nThis is perhaps the gravest allegation of presidential misconduct in the scandal-ridden four months of the Trump administration. This story is likely to be immensely consequential. Below are some initial thoughts based on the facts available about what this story is, what it isn’t, and what we do and do not yet know.\n\nFirst, this is not a question of “leaking classified information” or breaking a criminal law. Let’s dispense with one easy rabbit hole that a lot of people are likely to go down this evening: the President did not “leak” classified information in violation of law. He is allowed to do what he did. If anyone other than the President disclosed codeword intelligence to the Russians in such fashion, he’d likely be facing a long prison term. But Nixon’s infamous comment that “when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal” is actually true about some things. Classified information is one of them. The nature of the system is that the President gets to disclose what he wants.\n\nThe reason is that the very purpose of the classification system is to protect information the President, usually through his subordinates, thinks sensitive. So the President determines the system of designating classified information through Executive Order, and he is entitled to depart from it at will. Currently, Executive Order 13526 governs national security information.\n\nThe Supreme Court has stated in Department of the Navy v. Eganthat “[the President’s] authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security ... flows primarily from this Constitutional investment of power in the President and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant.” Because of his broad constitutional authority in this realm, the president can, at any time, either declassify information or decide whom to share it with.\n\nIn short, Trump did not violate any criminal law concerning the disclosure of classified information here. The question of criminality, however, is by no means the end of the analysis.\n\nSecond, this is not a garden variety breach, and outrage over it is not partisan hypocrisy about protecting classified information.\n\nThere is a semi-regular partisan food fight over the other party’s handling of classified information. There are too many examples of hypocrisy and faux-outrage on both sides to count. So Republicans can point to any number of statements by Democrats minimizing the significance or severity of disclosing classified information; Democrats, meanwhile can do the same with Republican statements underscoring the importance of protecting classified information.\n\nThis debate, which we assume to be inevitable, is a distraction and should be ignored.\n\nThe information allegedly disclosed here appears to be of an extremely sensitive nature. According to the Post, President Trump’s own aides “appeared to recognize immediately that Trump had overstepped and moved to contain the potential fallout” by contacting the directors of CIA and NSA. The Postdoes not report whether the White House also notified the foreign ally who provided the information of the compromise.\n\nThe information in question is of particular significance both because the Russians might be able to infer sources and methods, notwithstanding General McMaster’s careful statement that sources and methods were not “discussed,” and because it was shared with the United States by a foreign partner.  Indeed, the Post story discusses the concern of U.S. officials that the Russians might inferentially “identify the U.S. ally or intelligence capability involved, and one official is quoted as saying that  “Russia could identify our sources or techniques” based on what was disclosed.  If true, Trump did not just jeopardize our own intelligence sources, but those of another country. Intelligence sharing relationships are critical to U.S. security interests around the world, and in particular in the fight coalition against ISIS. The United States intelligence community and military are simply not able to access every relevant source of intelligence and thus depends on a network of intelligence sharing partnerships. Breaching the trust of a foreign partner could substantially harm that relationship moving forward and could undermine the confidence of other foreign governments in the U.S. government’s ability to safeguard information.\n\nConsider Israeli media reports from shortly before the inauguration that “Israeli intelligence officials [were] concerned that the exposure of classified information to their American counterparts under a Trump administration could lead to their being leaked to Russia and onward to Iran.” At the time, Haaretzwrote, on the basis of reporting in the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot:\n\nTo the extent foreign partners were already concerned, this episode seems to confirm their worst fears.\n\nThird, it is important to understand the nature of sources and methods information in order to fully understand the gravity of the breach.\n\nIn general, a Top Secret classification is applied toinformation “the unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to national security…” Of course, as discussed above, if the President disclosed the information it is not “unauthorized” within the technical meaning. Setting aside the technicalities, however, it is important to recognize that not all Top Secret information is created equal. The most sensitive category by far is that related to the protection of “sources and methods,” which relates not just to the substance of intelligence but to the manner by which it was obtained. If sources and methods information is revealed, it risks losing the method of collection in the future, which poses much larger long-term security consequences.\n\nThe Post reports that the “information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government.\" This is why Trump aides moved quickly to ensure that the information was “stricken from internal memos and for the full transcript to be limited to a small circle of recipients” in order to prevent further dissemination or leaks and to limit the damage from the disclosure.\n\nFor an illustration of the sensitivity of sources and methods, note that the U.S. intelligence community assessment of Russian hacking in the U.S. election opens by noting\n\nThe Obama administration took considerable criticism for failing to provide underlying information in that report, but ultimately was unwilling to risk compromises to sources and methods despite the exceedingly high stakes.  That tells you something about how vital it is to protect sources and methods. \n\nFourth, it really matters why Trump disclosed this information to Russian visitors.The story is vague on this point. But the question of why Trump acted as he did will matter a great deal to how the political system absorbs this news. The implication of the Post story is that Trump acted impulsively and in a boasting kind of way. If that’s right, the matter is egregiously bad.\n\nBut there are important questions on which Congress and the public will need clarity before deciding how to act. Did the disclosure serve a national security purpose, even in Trump’s mind? That is, if the President made a strategic judgment to release certain information in exchange for some anticipated gain, even if that judgment is wildly wrong, that is potentially less bad that if this is merely an example of loose lips sinking other countries’ ships–and our own country’s intelligence relationships. In other words, what Trump thought he was doing might well inflect whether we should see this as an act of carelessness, an act of carelessness bordering on treachery, or an act of judgment (even if misjudgment) of the sort we elect presidents to make.\n\nFifth, this may well be a violation of the President’s oath of office.Questions of criminality aside, we turn to the far more significant issues: If the President gave this information away through carelessness or neglect, he has arguably breached his oath of office. As Quinta and Ben have elaborated on in some detail, in taking the oath President Trump swore to “faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States” and to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States” to the best of his ability. It’s very hard to argue that carelessly giving away highly sensitive material to an adversary foreign power constitutes a faithful execution of the office of President.\n\nViolating the oath of office does not require violating a criminal statute. If the President decided to write the nuclear codes on a sticky note on his desk and then took a photo of it and tweeted it, he would not technically have violated any criminal law–just as he hasn’t here. He has the constitutional authority to dictate that the safeguarding of nuclear materials shall be done through sticky notes in plain sight and tweeted, even the authority to declassify the codes outright. Yet, we would all understand this degree of negligence to be a gross violation of his oath of office.\n\nCongress has alleged oath violations—albeit violations tied to criminal allegations or breaches of statutory obligations—all three times it has passed or considered seriously articles of impeachment against presidents: against Andrew Johnson (“unmindful of the high duties of his oath of office”), Richard Nixon (“contrary to his oath”), and Bill Clinton(“in violation of his constitutional oath”). Further, two of the three articles of impeachment against Nixon alleged no direct violation of the law. Instead, they concerned Nixon’s abuse of his power as President, which, like the President putting the nuclear codes on Twitter, is an offense that can only be committed by the President and has thus never been explicitly prohibited in criminal law.\n\nThere’s thus no reason why Congress couldn’t consider a grotesque violation of the President’s oath as a standalone basis for impeachment—a high crime and misdemeanor in and of itself. This is particularly plausible in a case like this, where the oath violation involves giving sensitive information to an adversary foreign power. That’s getting relatively close to the “treason” language in the impeachment clauses; it’s pretty easy to imagine a hybrid impeachment article alleging a violation of the oath in service of a hostile foreign power. So legally speaking, the matter could be very grave for Trump even though there is no criminal exposure.\n\nThis approach to sensitive information does not appear to be a one-off. President Trump has previously taken heat for his cavalier attitude towards safeguarding classified information, for example when he openly reviewed plans related to a North Korean nuclear test in the Mar-a-Lago dining room in full view of other diners or when he appeared to inadvertently confirm the authenticity of leaked CIA documents on Fox News.\n\nSixth, it matters hugely, at least from an atmospheric point of view, that the people in the room were Russian and one of them was Sergey Kislyak of all people.\n\nTake a step back and remember where we stand on L’Affaire Russe.Trump is currently under a tremendous amount of political pressure for his decision to fire the FBI Director, who was in the midst of conducting an investigation into possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign in the Russian effort to influence the U.S. presidential election. He has admitted on national television that his decision to dismiss Director James Comey was linked to Comey’s investigation. Four associates of Trump have been asked to hand over documents chronicling their conversations with Russian officials to the Senate Intelligence Committee, and one of those associates—former national security advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn—has been subpoenaed.\n\nIt’s particularly striking that among the Russian officials with whom Trump may have discussed classified information is none other than Kislyak, who has a habit of holding inopportune meetings with high-ranking members of the Trump team. It was conversations with Kislyak over the possible lifting of sanctions that led to Flynn’s resignation, and revelations of undisclosed meetings with the Ambassador during the campaign pushed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the Russia connection. \n\nThis matter may or may not have any connection whatsoever to the Trump-Russia story, which is playing out concurrently. But it will inevitably get mashed together with it. It’s important, however, to keep the issues mentally separate. After all, this conduct would be equally inexcusable if the recipients were not Russian, but say, Chinese. At the same time, the question of whether it’s a mere coincidence that the President disclosed codeword classified material to the Russian government, having spent the last few months deriding the idea that he had any connection to Russia as #FakeNews is one the White House cannot avoid.\n\nSeventh, Trump’s screw-up with the Russians in the Oval Office raises the stakes for whether he records conversations there. Last week, Trump tweeted that “James Comey better hope that there are no \"tapes\" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!”  This threat set off a raft of speculation about whether Trump records Oval Office conversations and, if so, what his legal duties are to preserve those recordings. The speculation continued through today, when Sean Spicer studiously declined to address whether any such recording system exists.  If such a recording system does exist, the conversations recorded could go a long way towards answering the mysteries above regarding why the President gave this information to the Russians, and whether he violated his oath or some other law in the process.  We thus expect the incident with the Russians to put even more pressure on the White House to answer the question whether the recording system exists.\n\nEighth, this episode raises the stakes on the nomination of the FBI Director to replace Comey. Ben and Jack explained this morning why Trump must not appoint a political figure for the job, but rather must replace Comey with someone apolitical with law enforcement expertise and a reputation for independence. One reason for the conclusion, but only one, was the need for absolute vigilance, and the appearance of vigilance, in the investigation of the DNC hack and the Trump campaign and administration. Trump’s intelligence spill in the Oval Office to senior Russian officials is but the latest and perhaps greatest piece of evidence of extraordinarily suspicious behavior by the Trump team—this time the President himself—and Russian officials. The episode will make it yet harder to have a legitimate and credible resolution to the Trump-Russia investigation, and thus makes it all the more critical to have an FBI Director who is independent and enjoys bipartisan support.   \n\nFinally, Trump’s alleged screw-up with the Russians reveals yet again what we have learned many times in the last four months: The successful operation of our government assumes a minimally competent Chief Executive that we now lack.Everyone else in the Executive Branch can be disciplined or fired or worse when they screw up by, say, revealing classified information or lying about some important public policy issue. But the President cannot be fired; we are stuck with him for 3-1/2 more years unless he is impeached, which remains a long-shot.\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nBottom line: It matters who we have running the most powerful institution in the world."],[5,"Donald Trump Transition Team Ordered to Preserve Documents","The Trump transition team has been instructed to save documents related to the ongoing investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, the New York Times reports.\n\nThe transition team’s general counsel’s office reportedly sent a memo to members of the transition team, ordering them to preserve “any physical and electronic records that may be related in any way to the subject matter of the pending investigations,” according to the report.\n\nInformation on former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former adviser Carter Page, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, business partner of Manafort’s Rick Gates, and Roger Stone, who is called an informal Trump adviser in the document, is also being sought in the memo. The men named in the memo have been at times linked to the investigations into Russian meddling.\n\nThe Times reports that the internal memo indicates that any failure to preserve documents could result in criminal or civil penalties and “could form the basis of legal claims, legal presumptions, or jury instructions relating to spoliation of evidence.”\n\nPresident Trump has continued to blast the investigation into Russian meddling as a “witch hunt” that has so far failed to produce any evidence that he colluded with Russians."],[5,"Why Trump and Francis Diverge on Saudi Arabia","The meeting May 24 between two opposing titans, U.S. President Donald Trump and Pope Francis, attracted attention mainly for the stylistic and substantive differences between the two men, not because anything serious was expected to come out of their abbreviated 30-minute encounter. Indeed, considering past heated exchanges between the Pope and Trump, it might seem surprising the Vatican was added to the president’s whirlwind itinerary at all. In February 2016, Francis implicitly challenged the then-presidential candidate’s faith by telling reporters that “a person who only thinks of building walls…and not building bridges is not Christian.” Trump responded by calling the Pope’s comments “disgraceful,” only to hear Francis repeat a new version of the charge just a few months ago. But throughout his papacy, Francis has urged encounter and dialogue, so it is in character that he agreed to look for doors “at least a little bit open…and go on, step by step” with Trump.\n\nTwo factors put the antagonists together. The first is tradition: every U.S. president since Harry Truman has visited the Holy See while in Italy. (Trump was there attending a G–7 summit in Sicily.) The second is that the White House cast the first portion of his first presidential trip abroad as a tour of religious homelands. So Trump’s Vatican visit was the final act in a theatrical production that opened in Riyadh.\n\nIn the end, though, the framing might have been a problem. Indeed, it perturbed the Vatican last week that Trump was so triumphalist in Saudi Arabia, one of the few countries to have no diplomatic relations with the Holy See. From the Kingdom’s treatment of Christians living within its borders, to its international export of intolerance, to the devastation wrought by its war in Yemen, Francis and the Vatican take a much more critical line toward Saudi Arabia than does the Trump administration. U.S. administrations have collaborated on a variety of diplomatic initiatives with the Holy See,"],[5,"John McCain jokes about his confused questioning in Senate committee hearing","John McCain has provided a surprising excuse for his strange line of questioning during Thursday's Senate hearing with James Comey - saying that he was tired from staying up late the previous night to watch sport.\n\nMr McCain, the 80-year-old grandee of the Republican Party, struck an unusual tone in the hearing.\n\nHis meandering questions asked about Hillary Clinton's emails, and why one investigation was closed but the other ongoing.\n\n\"With respect... I'm a little confused,\" said Mr Comey at one point, struggling to answer."],[5,"Comey Memo Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn Investigation","In a statement, the White House denied the version of events in the memo.\n\n“While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,” the statement said. “The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.”\n\nMr. Chaffetz’s letter, sent to the acting F.B.I. director, Andrew G. McCabe, set a May 24 deadline for the internal documents to be delivered to the House committee. The congressman, a Republican, was criticized in recent months for showing little of the appetite he demonstrated in pursuing Hillary Clinton to pursue investigations into Mr. Trump’s associates.\n\nBut since announcing in April that he will not seek re-election in 2018, Mr. Chaffetz has shown more interest in the Russia investigation, and held out the potential for a subpoena on Tuesday, a notably aggressive move as most Republicans have tried to stay out of the fray.\n\nIn testimony to the Senate last week, Mr. McCabe said, “There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date.” Mr. McCabe was referring to the broad investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The investigation into Mr. Flynn is separate.\n\nA spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment.\n\nMr. Comey created similar memos — including some that are classified — about every phone call and meeting he had with the president, the two people said. It is unclear whether Mr. Comey told the Justice Department about the conversation or his memos.\n\nMr.Trump fired Mr. Comey last week. Trump administration officials have provided multiple, conflicting accounts of the reasoning behind Mr. Comey’s dismissal. Mr. Trump said in a television interview that one of the reasons was because he believed “this Russia thing” was a “made-up story.”\n\nThe Feb. 14 meeting took place just a day after Mr. Flynn wasforced out of hisjob after it was revealed he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of phone conversations he had had with the Russian ambassador to the United States.\n\nDespite the conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Comey, the investigation of Mr. Flynn has proceeded. In Virginia, a federal grand jury has issued subpoenas in recent weeks for records related to Mr. Flynn. Part of the Flynn investigation is centered on his financial links to Russia and Turkey.\n\nMr. Comey had been in the Oval Office that day with other senior national security officials for a terrorism threat briefing. When the meeting ended, Mr. Trump told those present — including Mr. Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions — to leave the room except for Mr. Comey.\n\nAlone in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump began the discussion by condemning leaks to the news media, saying that Mr. Comey should consider putting reporters in prison for publishing classified information, according to one of Mr. Comey’s associates.\n\nMr. Trump then turned the discussion to Mr. Flynn.\n\nAfter writing up a memo that outlined the meeting, Mr. Comey shared it with senior F.B.I. officials. Mr. Comey and his aides perceived Mr. Trump’s comments as an effort to influence the investigation, but they decided that they would try to keep the conversation secret — even from the F.B.I. agents working on the Russia investigation — so the details of the conversation would not affect the investigation.\n\nMr. Comey was known among his closest advisers to document conversations that he believed would later be called into question, according to two former confidants, who said Mr. Comey was uncomfortable at times with his relationship with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Comey’s recollection has been bolstered in the past by F.B.I. notes. In 2007, he told Congress about a now-famous showdown with senior White House officials over the Bush administration’s warrantless wiretapping program. The White House disputed Mr. Comey’s account, but the F.B.I. director at the time, Robert S. Mueller III, kept notes that backed up Mr. Comey’s story.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly crossed lines that other administrations have been reluctant to cross when discussing politically charged criminal investigations. Mr. Trump has disparaged the continuing F.B.I. investigation as a hoax and called for an inquiry into his political rivals. His representatives have taken the unusual step of declaring no need for a special prosecutor to investigate the president’s associates.\n\nThe Oval Office meeting occurred a little over two weeks after Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Comey to the White House for a lengthy, one-on-one dinner at the residence. At that dinner, on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey at least two times for a pledge of loyalty — which Mr. Comey declined, according to one of Mr. Comey’s associates.\n\nIn a Twitter post onFriday, Mr. Trump said that “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!”\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr. Comey’s associates did not believe there was any way to corroborate Mr. Trump’s statements. But Mr. Trump’s suggestion last week that he was keeping tapes has made them wonder whether there are tapes that back up Mr. Comey’s account.\n\nThe Jan. 27 dinner came a day after White House officials learned that Mr. Flynn had been interviewed by F.B.I. agents about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak. On Jan. 26, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, told the White House counsel about the interview, and said Mr. Flynn could be subject to blackmail by the Russians because they knew he had lied about the content of the calls."],[5,"Donald Trump Withdraws From Paris Climate Deal Despite Allies’ Opposition","President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate accord on Thursday.

Griffin also said bullying from Trump and his family has destroyed her life.\n\n“I don’t think I’m going to have a career after this. I’m going to be honest, he broke me,” Griffin said, breaking into tears. “A sitting president of the United States and his grown children, and the First Lady, personally, I feel, are trying to ruin my life forever.”\n\nGriffin said she was was mocking Trump’s previous remarks about Megyn Kelly having “blood coming out of her wherever” when she posed for what became a widely condemned photo. She was trying to interpret the “sexist” remarks Trump made last year after a Republican debate in which he said moderator Kelly had “blood coming out of her eyes.”\n\n“It was a parody of Trump’s own sexist remarks taken to an extreme absurdist visual,” Griffin’s attorney Lisa Bloom said. “Kathy teamed up with a photographer to mock Trump, our mocker-in-chief, [to show] what would it look like if his own insults were turned on him.”\n\nThe photo shows a straight-faced Griffin holding up a fake, decapitated Trump head, which is covered in dripping blood. It drew outrage from both sides of the political spectrum, including Trump’s family.\n\nThe President said on Twitter Wednesday that Griffin “should be ashamed of herself” for the “sick” stunt, adding that his 11-year-old son, Barron, was having a “hard time with this.” First Lady Melania Trump said in a statement: “As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing. When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong.”\n\nThe President’s son, Donald Trump Jr., criticized the comedian in a series of tweets in which he accused Griffin of issuing a “phony apology” and repeatedly called for CNN to sever ties with Griffin.\n\nGriffin had apologized for the image, saying in a video Tuesday that she “crossed the line” and “was wrong.” “It wasn’t funny. I get it,” she said, admitting that it was “too disturbing.”\n\nCNN dumped the two-time Emmy award and Grammy award-winning as co-host of its New Year’s Eve live show, the cable news network announced Wednesday. A day before, Squatty Potty, a toilet stool company, said it suspended its ad campaign that Griffin starred in."],[5,"Donald Trump campaign repeatedly met with Russia to set up secret communications channel, report reveals","Donald Trump's campaign made contact with Russia at least 18 times during his presidential race, according to a new report.\n\nThe interactions had previously been kept secret by the campaign but are now being reviewed as part of the FBI and congressional investigation into Trump's relationship with Russia.\n\nConversations between members of Trump's team and high-ranking officials including setting up a special backchannel for communications between the President and Putin, Reuters reported. That would allow the two talk without involving US national security officials.\n\nSuch discussions accelerated after Donald Trump won the election, in November.\n\nThe 18 calls and electronic messages took place between April and November 2016 as hackers engaged in what US intelligence concluded in January was part of a Kremlin campaign to discredit the vote and influence the outcome of the election in favour of Trump over his Democratic challenger, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.\n\nThose discussions focused on mending US-Russian economic relations strained by sanctions imposed on Moscow, cooperating in fighting Islamic State in Syria and containing a more assertive China, the sources said.\n\nIn January, the Trump White House initially denied any contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. The White House and advisers to the campaign have since confirmed four meetings between Kislyak and Trump advisers during that time.\n\nThe people who described the contacts to Reuters said they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion between the campaign and Russia in the communications reviewed so far. But the disclosure could increase the pressure on Trump and his aides to provide the FBI and Congress with a full account of interactions with Russian officials and others with links to the Kremlin during and immediately after the 2016 election.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment. Flynn's lawyer declined to comment. In Moscow, a Russian foreign ministry official declined to comment on the contacts and referred Reuters to the Trump administration.\n\nIn the conversations during the campaign, Russian officials emphasized a pragmatic, business-style approach and stressed to Trump associates that they could make deals by focusing on common economic and other interests and leaving contentious issues aside, the sources said.\n\nVeterans of previous election campaigns said some contact with foreign officials during a campaign was not unusual, but the number of interactions between Trump aides and Russian officials and others with links to Putin was exceptional.\n\n\"It's rare to have that many phone calls to foreign officials, especially to a country we consider an adversary or a hostile power,\" Richard Armitage, a Republican and former deputy secretary of state, told Reuters.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters"],[5,"Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron congratulate Theresa May","Theresa May received telephone calls from the presidents of the US and France to 'congratulate' her on returning to Downing Street.\n\nAfter the Tories saw their Commons majority wiped out as Mrs May sought to continue in power heading a minority administration backed by the Democratic Unionist Party, US President Donald Trump told the PM he looked forward to continued 'close co-operation', while Emmanuel Macron invited her to visit France.\n\nInitially the US President had admitted the result had caught him off guard, but called his British counterpart to offer his 'warm support'.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said: 'US President Donald Trump called the Prime Minister to offer his congratulations. \n\n'Both sides agreed they look forward to continuing the close cooperation between our two countries.\n\n'The French President Emmanuel Macron called to congratulate the Prime Minister, and said he was pleased that she would continue to be a close partner.\n\n'The president invited the Prime Minister to visit France at the earliest possible opportunity, and they agreed that the strong friendship between our two countries was important and would endure.'\n\nDonald Trump and Theresa May spoke over the phone. \n\nA White House spokesman said the Prime Minister and the President had agreed to continue the close cooperation between their two countries.\n\nTrump stressed his commitment to the 'special relationship' between the United States and Britain and said he looked forward to working with May 'on shared goals and interests in the years to come'."],[5,"null","Sadiq Khan has “more important things to do” than respond to Donald Trump’s “ill-informed” tweets, the London Mayor’s spokesman has said after the US President goaded the British politician in the aftermath of terror attacks on the UK capital.\n\nTrump was accused of “fake news” after taking Khan’s call for Londoners to stay calm out of context.\n\nKhan, the first elected Muslim mayor of a European city, said there was “no reason to be alarmed” by the increased police presence in the capital over the next few days.\n\nBut Trump twisted his words to reference the number of people killed and injured by the terrorists."],[5,"Pope Francis, Donald Trump: Viral Photo From Vatican Meeting","Did Pope Francis smile when he met President Trump? It depends on the picture.\n\nAll eyes were on the Vatican on Wednesday when Trump, along with members of his family and political inner circle, shared a private audience with the pontiff. Trump had a half hour of the pope’s time for a discussion; they also exchanged gifts and posed for pictures. One image in particular, of a grinning Trump next to a stone-faced Pope Francis, has gone viral.\n\nThe Pope does not look happy to be standing next to Trump, with whom he has publicly feuded in the past. It was noted that Francis has smiled during similar photo-ops with other heads of state, from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to former President Obama. On Wednesday, photos of Obama with a smiley pope in March 2014 made the rounds alongside the Trump image, suggesting Francis was happier to meet Obama than Trump.\n\nBut that’s not quite the full picture. Evan Vucci, the Associated Press photographer who made this picture, recalled the rapidly unfolding scene in a phone call on Wednesday. “It happens so fast, like a pool spray at the White House,” he tells TIME.\n\nVucci was among six photographers who got into the room. The group was first ushered in to photograph Trump and Francis as they sat across from one another at a desk, then back out so the pair could meet. About a half hour later, they returned for more pictures. “We were instructed to stay behind the gift table. It’s packed and everyone is jostling for position,” Vucci says. “They’re shaking hands, [Trump’s] introducing the delegation. Then they do this big group photo.”\n\nThe whole group scene was “probably 30 seconds,” he adds. “The mood in the room, it didn’t seem somber. The pope was smiling. They were sort of talking. Nothing seemed unusual to me or out of the ordinary.”\n\nAs is often the case with high-profile Trump photo-ops, his online critics will pounce on an image that makes him look aloof, disinterested, uninformed and everything in between. In other cases, images have been shared widely because the shutter clicked at the moment when someone Trump is meeting, say, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, appeared to show hesitation—like during an Oval Office handshake. This is a longterm issue for Trump, with Francis as the latest example.\n\nChoosing to share an image can be incredibly subjective, with a number of factors in play from composition and tonality to political bias and intent. A great image will tell the truth. Many other images from the same scene can often do the opposite.\n\nIt is true that a photo editor on Wednesday would have experienced slight difficulty while searching for an image of both Trump and Francis appearing to be delighted in one another’s company. But those images do exist, like this one of Francis smiling as he and Trump exchange gifts.\n\nThis is just one image, from one click of the shutter, during a moment when hundreds of pictures were made. For Vucci, a veteran political photojournalist, his work is all about honesty. “I’m trying to be as fair as possible, that’s my job,” he says. “And where people take it, it’s up to them.”\n\nAnd it’s worth noting that when looking back to Obama’s Vatican visit, there is a larger group shot very similar to Wednesday’s.\n\nFrancis isn’t smiling in either shot. You just might not see that image appear in your feed."],[5,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Justice League","Special Counsel Robert Mueller is tasked with overseeing the Russiagate case from investigation to litigation.

The former Trump campaign manager was forced to resign over questions about his business dealings in the Ukraine. In an interview with the AP, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Mueller’s assignment gives him the authority to also include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the firing of former FBI Director James Comey and even himself into the expanding investigation.\n\nWhile these actions involve major steps in the investigation phase, at the same time Robert Mueller is also developing the litigation phase. He is putting together a team of prodigious legal talent and experience: a real life Justice League. This story features five of those members: James Quarles III, Andrew Weissmann, Aaron Zebley, Jeannie Rhee and Peter Carr. "],[5,"Trump once cheered Comey for the same reason he just fired him","(CNN)Eight days before Donald Trump won the presidency, he singled out FBI director James Comey for a special round of praise during a speech to supporters in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n\"It took guts for director Comey to make the move that he made,\" Trump said of the FBI chief's decision to make public the bureau's revived probe into Hillary Clinton's private email server. \"It took a lot of guts.\"\n\nBut on Tuesday night, with the FBI now investigating the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia, the White House, acting on advice from the Justice Department, fired Comey.\n\n\"The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong,\" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote in a letter explaining his reasoning.\n\nHe added, without irony, that Comey had been wrong to use his July press conference, in which he publicly cleared Clinton, to \"release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,\" a reference to Comey's broadly critical remarks about Clinton's behavior.\n\nWhile Trump railed against the initial announcement, he openly celebrated the FBI director's letter to Congress, delivered on October 28 -- when early voting had already begun in some states -- that his investigators were examining newly discovered emails that \"appear to be pertinent\" to the server probe.\n\nIn the end, there was nothing newly pertinent to the probe. But in the meantime, Trump crowed.\n\n\"I really disagreed with him (in July), I was not his fan,\" he said in Michigan on Halloween. \"But I'll tell you what -- what he did, he brought back his reputation. He brought it back. He's got to hang tough because a lot of people want him to do the wrong thing.\n\n\"But what he did,\" Trump continued, \"was the right thing.\"\n\nThen last week, after Comey's most recent testimony, Trump tweeted the FBI director was the \"best thing\" that could have happened to Clinton because he \"gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!\"\n\nalong with the candidate herself Democrats, too, have changed their tune in the aftermath of Comey's shock firing. In particular, top Clinton campaign staffers, many of whom -- along with the candidate herself -- believe his \"October surprise\" helped deliver Trump the White House.\n\n\"I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation,\" former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. \"But President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called 'charade' only 24 hours ago.\""],[5,"Health bill could show limits of Trump's Senate sway","President Donald Trump is starting to whip votes for the Senate health bill, but he could find his influence there is more limited than in the House of Representatives, where he cajoled, cursed and wooed members to vote for his top campaign promise.\n\nAides to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell briefed White House staffers Wednesday evening on the details of the bill they’ve been writing in secret, before it is expected to be made public Thursday. The president is expected to endorse their plan to repeal Obamacare. But even with Trump’s help, the bill faces a perilous path in the Senate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump called Sen. Rand Paul Tuesday to see if he could be convinced to back the bill. Paul said he gave Trump no guarantees he’d vote for the bill, which he described as too much like Obamacare.\n\n\"We might have to play golf again,\" Paul told POLITICO as he recounted their conversation.\n\n“If it doesn’t work for Alaska, it doesn’t make any difference who’s calling me,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), preemptively dismissing any attempt by Trump to twist her arm; she said he hasn’t reached out yet. Murkowski and Paul are two of the senators who are most skeptical of the health legislation, though they have different complaints.\n\nThe Trump White House has been conspicuously hands-off in the drafting of the Senate bill. In previous administrations, the president likely would have laid out guiding principles for legislation during the campaign and lawmakers would follow his lead in drafting it. That has not happened in the Senate. “They just don’t participate in the policy,” a chief of staff to one Senate Republican said of the White House.\n\nLegislative affairs director Marc Short and his team have recently spent weekends and nights huddling with McConnell's staff and senators, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Director Seema Verma also has met with senators, two White House officials said.\n\nBut three senior administration officials said they had not seen the details of the bill as recently as Tuesday afternoon. Asked Wednesday aboard Air Force One if Trump had seen details, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that \"the appropriate individuals have seen the bill,\" according to a pool report.\n\nThe White House is offering “technical advice” from officials such as Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Vice President Mike Pence, said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who is helping draft the bill. Outside groups that got involved in the House’s legislative effort earlier this year also have largely stayed away from the Senate process, knowing McConnell is in charge.\n\n\"The White House is leaving it to Mitch, and I think that's smart,\" said former Majority Leader Trent Lott, who recently met with several senators. \"He's a wily old rascal and knows how to work his conference.\"\n\nWhite House and Capitol Hill officials are privately concerned that Trump’s lack of policy expertise could throw off fluid dynamics — and potentially hurt in negotiations with some senators, one Capitol Hill and one White House official close to the talks said. Members of the House Freedom Caucus complained in March that Trump was not engaged in policy details they cared about in an earlier version of health care legislation.\n\nHaving the president discuss a bill in depth with a senator doesn't \"use his talents well, and it's not going to help us,\" one White House official said. Some Republicans who were not vocal Trump backers, such as Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mike Lee, might not be swayed by a call from the president.\n\nTwo White House officials also said they didn't think McConnell — who has tightly controlled the process, hand-selecting a group of lawmakers to help write the bill — would let them have much control \"even if we wanted it.\"\n\n\"There were more leakers and many more drama queens on the House side during that whole debate. He runs a very tight ship,\" one of the White House officials said of McConnell.\n\nTrump, one outside ally said, has criticized the House bill and senators at different points — \"telling people what they want to hear about it.\" He has asked few questions about the specific language in the bill, one administration official said, but has asked repeatedly about vote totals.\n\nHe has focused more of his attention on the ongoing Russia investigation, said the outside ally, who has spoken to Trump.\n\nSenate leaders will begin whipping votes after the text is released on Thursday, and Trump’s involvement is expected to increase after that. The White House has looked at Trump's poll numbers in certain states, wondering how much pressure he could exert in the final days on particular senators.\n\nOfficials have expressed rising optimism in recent days that the bill will pass. \"Businessmen don't do one task at a time. As president he's proven that he's prolific, that he can meet with tech giants and open apprenticeships at the same time. And still work on completing repeal and a replace as a top priority,\" said Kellyanne Conway, the president's counselor.\n\nBut a handful of Republicans still seem skeptical about the legislation, and White House officials have begun envisioning scenarios in which McConnell loses two Republican votes and the Senate is tied, requiring Pence to cast the 51st vote in favor of the bill.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) raised doubts that McConnell and his team were responding to Trump’s complaint in a meeting last week that the House bill was too harsh.\n\n“The president has argued for a more generous bill,” she said in an interview. “We’ll have to see what comes out tomorrow, but I’m wondering if those who are drafting the bill are listening to what the president said about the need for the bill to be more generous.”\n\nPaul, too, could be a tough sell. If Trump can secure his vote, it would be a big win, because the Kentuckian’s colleagues in the Senate are skeptical he will get on board.\n\nSunday is supposed to be 85 degrees and sunny in Washington — a perfect day for golf."],[5,"Macron and Trump's two tense handshake battles – video","Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron meet for the first time in Brussels on Thursday, shaking hands awkwardly for the cameras. Later in the day at the new Nato headquarters, they shake hands again, a bit more vigorously this time"],[5,"Elon Musk threatens to quit Trump’s advisory council over the Paris climate deal","Tesla chief executive Elon Musk threatened Wednesday to resign his position as an adviser to President Trump if the United States withdraws from the Paris climate deal, a remark that highlights Trump's precarious position in a high-stakes international standoff.\n\nTrump could decide as early as this week whether the United States will remain in the historic Paris agreement, which reflects a voluntary commitment by the world's governments to reduce their carbon emissions.\n\nMusk said on Twitter that he had done all he could to advise the White House on the deal that was signed in 2016 by 195 countries.\n\nAsked by another Twitter user what would happen if Trump withdraws despite Musk's advice, the entrepreneur said he would have “no choice” in the matter.\n\nTesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs a technology executive who has cited climate change as a key reason behind his push for electric vehicles, Musk has a personal and professional stake in the United States' climate-change policies.\n\nMusk's resignation in protest would show a loss of faith in Trump by a key business leader, weakening the economic credibility Trump sought for his administration by appointing nearly 20 powerful CEOs to a advisory council in December. In addition to Musk, Trump named the chief executives of JP Morgan, Disney and IBM to the panel.\n\nThis is not the first time the future of Musk's advisory role has come into question. When Trump in January signed his controversial executive order temporarily barring refugees and some immigrants from entering the United States, a number of tech companies said their workforces were directly affected by the ban. Musk said then that he would not step down as a strategic adviser. He argued that while he did not agree with all of Trump's policies, he believed his participation was important for providing “feedback on issues that I think are important for our country and the world.”\n\nMusk's strategic use of his position contrasts with that of Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick, who left Trump's advisory council amid widespread criticism over his role. Earlier this year, as Trump's travel ban went into effect, Uber drivers continued to pick up passengers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York despite an effort by taxi drivers to boycott over the issue. Uber's decision not to halt its service to JFK was viewed by some critics as a tacit endorsement of the Trump policy. Although Kalanick later said in a company-wide memo that he never intended it to be interpreted that way, the episode ultimately led to Kalanick stepping down from the business leaders council."],[5,"Bernie Sanders explains why Trump is so dangerous","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders may have lost his bid for the White House in 2016, but he’s sure as hell not ready to fade into obscurity anytime soon. Instead, he’s emerged as a gadfly, loudly and publicly sounding the alarm on what he sees as the country’s troubling descent into authoritarianism under President Donald Trump.\n\n“I can't remember a president who has had more authoritarian tendencies than Trump,” Sanders told me in an interview on Wednesday. “What is going on is not only this rise of authoritarianism but also, simultaneously, you are seeing this country move very rapidly toward oligarchy.”\n\nAs Sanders prepared to give a big speech on Thursday at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he got on the phone with me to talk about Trump’s admiration for authoritarian leaders, his attacks on the media, the Russia investigation, and more.\n\nSanders told me he believes Trump has a basic disrespect for the fundamental pillars of democracy — the press, the judicial system — that mimics the authoritarian regimes the Trump administration has cozied up to around the globe. And that combination, he says, is dangerous.\n\nWhat follows is a partial transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nThere has never been a president, or even a leading public official, who has lied as often or as dangerously as Trump has.\n\nAnd when the president of the United States lies a whole lot and makes outrageous statements, it's not only bad unto itself, but it also opens the door for other people to be lying and for truth to be disrespected. And that is a very dangerous thing for the fabric of American society.\n\nWhen he talks about 3 to 5 million people voting illegally in the last election — no one believes that, it is an outrageous lie —- but what that does is tell Republican governors that they should go forward to suppress the vote, to make it harder for people to vote, under the guise of voter fraud.\n\nEvery politician has disagreements with the media and how they cover this or that story, and I am certainly one of those. But there has never been a president, or political leader, who has basically said, “Everything you see on mainstream television or mainstream media — the New York Times, the Washington Post, Vox, whatever it may be — is a lie, don’t believe it.”\n\nIf you take that to its logical conclusion, and some people have, then where do you get the truth? Where do you learn about what’s going on that you can’t see with your own eyes? Who’s going to help you? It kind of leads you to the conclusion that there is only one person in America who can tell us the truth, and that is the president of the United States.\n\nDo you think he’s a demagogue?\n\nWell, I think that ... let me continue and then you can ask me a question, fair enough?\n\nSo you have this unprecedented attack on the media. What this guy is doing is basically telling the American people, “You cannot trust anything in mainstream media.”\n\nThen, on top of that, he is attacking the judiciary system and Department of Justice. A judge rules against him — that is not unusual; judges often rule against presidents and against legislation — but you don't go around undermining the judiciary and calling people “so-called judges” because they ruled against you.\n\nThen on top of that, you have his support for authoritarian leaders.\n\nThe American people, I think, whether you are a Republican or Democrat, have a hard time understanding his affection for a guy like [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, who has worked overtime to undermine not only democracy in his own country but also democracy in the United States.\n\nDo you want a good relationship with Russia? Of course you do. But why would you have what appears to be a personal affection for an authoritarian leader? It is not just Putin. It is also [President Rodrigo] Duterte of the Philippines; it is the royal family of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAgain: You may want to make alliances, you may not; those are debates you have to have. But for a country like the United States, which has been seen, historically, as one of the great promoters of democracy, why have this affinity for so many authoritarian countries?\n\nI have spoken to conservatives who share these exact same concerns.\n\nDo you see this as a global phenomenon? Why do you think we may be seeing public support around the world for authoritarian characters or politicians? And, go back to my original question, do you think he is a demagogue — is that what you are moving toward saying?\n\nLet me take the last question first. Both good questions.\n\nYou can contrast this with a very conservative Republican president named George W. Bush. I opposed Bush on virtually every piece legislation, every initiative, he put forward. Virtually all of them. But if you remember, Bush’s response to 9/11 was to visit a mosque — a very profound statement for a conservative Republican — essentially what he was saying is that we have to stand together, don't judge people by religion or by the color of their skin, and that America is a country which belongs to all of us.\n\nContrast that with Trump’s effort to start a program in which is he is documenting every crime an undocumented person commits, [his] verbal attacks against Latinos and against Muslims, and his effort, it seems to me, to try to make political points by dividing us up by scapegoating minorities.\n\nThat is not what a leader of any democratic country should be doing. That is part of the tradition and history of demagoguery. It divides people up.\n\nThat leads to your other question: Is this happening around the world? The answer is yes, it is.\n\nAnd why is it happening? For a lot of the same reasons it is happening in the United States. The radical changes to the global economy over the last 40 to 50 years, which have benefited some people, no question about it, but have left behind tens and tens of millions of people who are today working longer hours for lower wages, who are worried to death about whether their kids can afford to go to college and whether their kids will ever have a standard of living as high as they themselves have.\n\nA whole lot of people have been left behind in the global economy, in the United States — in rural areas, in inner cities all over this country. A lot of people have been left behind, and they are angry, they are furious, and they think people do not understand their pain. And then you have demagogues trying to explain that the problem is some Mexican farm worker who makes eight bucks an hour or someone who is a Muslim.\n\nTens and tens of millions of Americans today are struggling to keep heads above water economically.\n\nWhat rational leadership is about is putting those problems on the table and saying, “All right, here are problems: We’ve got 28 million Americans with no health insurance. How do we deal with that issue?” rather than demagoguing about that issue and blaming minorities for the problems the country faces.\n\nThis is certainly an international phenomenon — you see it with the National Front in France, and you see [a] similar type phenomenon with Putin in Russia.\n\nIn Berlin this May, you gave a speech where you said, “What has become absolutely clear since the election is that Donald Trump represents something we haven’t seen before in the United States. A trend toward authoritarianism, a normalization of corruption and the rise of oligarchy.” Can you unpack the last part of that sentence?\n\nYou got my quote right.\n\nWhat is going on is not only this rise of authoritarianism but also, simultaneously, you are seeing this country move very rapidly toward oligarchy.\n\nThe media doesn't talk about it very often. I do. Because it's frightening, and I don't think the media is comfortable with it — but the truth is in America today, you have the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and you’ve got 20 people in America owning as much wealth as [the] bottom half of America, and you are seeing 52 percent of all new income generated today going to the top 1 percent.\n\nSo just an incredible inequality, in terms of wealth and income, that we have not seen since the Great Depression, since 1928.\n\nOn top of that, [we have] a political system in which the Koch brothers and other billionaires are able to spend unlimited sums through Citizens United to buy elections for the candidates who represent their interests.\n\nYou add that together with a media which is also increasingly owned by fewer and fewer people around the world. I think it is fair to say we are moving toward oligarchy, where we have an economy and a political system controlled by few incredibly wealthy people.\n\nAnd [as to] the corruption aspect of this: There is an incredible blurring of business interests for the Trump family with public policy. Is Trump making foreign policy decisions on behalf of the American people and what is best for the world? Or is he making those decisions on behalf of Trump enterprises? That’s a whole other area.\n\nThere seems little doubt that Russians attempted in some way to influence our election. How has this played out in terms of how you see the Trump administration moving toward authoritarianism?\n\nWell, that’s a question that obviously is being investigated right now. You are right there is nobody who denies that Russia played a significant role in trying to influence the election on behalf of Trump. So the question being investigated now is was there collusion? And you have [special counsel Robert] Mueller and his team working on that, and you have the House and Senate Intelligence Committees working on that. We will see where that will go.\n\nI don’t have the answer, and I don't want to speak before I have facts in front of us. Trump fired [FBI Director James] Comey. Did he fire Comey because he thought Comey was a bad FBI director and he needed a change in the FBI? If that is the case, that is what a president can do.\n\nOr did he fire Comey because Comey was launching a significant investigation about possible collusion of the Trump campaign with Russia? If that’s the case, then that's just another argument about the movement of this country toward authoritarianism, because that is obstructing justice. And that’s what’s being looked at.\n\nYou said a few times that this is a first in American history — but there are aspects of these issues that have repeated themselves throughout history. Do you think this a repeat of something we saw in the 1930s, for example, or otherwise?\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nYes and no. Yes — look, we had Joe McCarthy. But I don't know if you have had a president whose actions —- in terms of dishonesty, clear dishonesty, in terms of the attacks on the media, trying to undermine people’s faith in what they see, hear, and read, and support for authoritarian regimes — I don't know if you have had a president who has put all of these characteristics together at one time.\n\nI can't remember a president who has had more authoritarian tendencies than Trump.\n\nSarah Wildman\n\nWhat role do you think the media needs to play? What happens when you undermine the Fourth Estate?\n\nTrump says, [essentially] “Hey all of these, ABC, CBS, VOX, everybody else, anybody in the mainstream media, they are all liars, they hate me, they are trying to undermine me, so don't believe a word of it.”\n\nWhat does that tell the average person in this country? Where will they get the truth?\n\nThat is a very profound development. After all, where do you get truth? How do you get truth? How do you know what is going on in Washington, DC? Is it just Trump's tweets? I think when a president says, “This is a [news] story, I disagree with it, this is why I disagree with it” — there’s nothing wrong with that. I do that every day. But to say, “Everything you are seeing in the media is a lie” — wow, that is pretty dangerous stuff.\n\nYou mentioned the National Front earlier — there was great anxiety that she had a chance to succeed, but actually, in the end, Marine Le Pen, and the far right in France, was profoundly unsuccessful. What was different there that we didn't experience here?\n\nLet’s not forget that if you had a popular vote that was announced at 11 pm on election night — [Hillary] Clinton won the popular vote by 2.9 million votes. That’s a difference. Emmanuel Macron did not go through a complicated Electoral College which allowed someone who received a minority of the votes to become president; that’s one of the differences. That’s a good discussion. Maybe we can have it another time."],[5,"WATCH: Bush's Former Chief of Staff Slams CNN's Trump/Russia Coverage. \"You Have Nothing.\"","Former New Hampshire governor and chief of staff for George H.W.

They fired Preet Bharara. And they fired James Comey , the very man leading he investigation. This does not seem to be a coincidence,\" Schumer said shortly after the announcement, calling for a special independent prosecutor into the Trump campaign's ties to the Kremlin.\n\n\"Any person who he appoints to lead the Russian investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey,\" he said.\n\nThe FBI director saw his reputation compromised when he became embroiled in the 2016 election campaign. He was first criticized by Republicans when he announced he wouldn't be charging then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her emails, and then by Democrats for publicly reopening the case days before Americans went to the polls.\n\nThe Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a privateemail server. In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was \"hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,\" explaining that he reached the conclusion that the erstwhile director was \"not able to effectively lead the bureau.\"\n\nAs head of the FBI, he was overseeing the investigation into the Trump campaign's allegedties to the Kremlin. Democrats have ridiculed the notion that the Clinton issue is what truly prompted Comey's dismissal, drawing parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggesting Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.\n\nAt a hearing last week, Comey confirmed that the FBI's investigation into accusations of coordination between Trump's presidential campaign and Russian officials was continuing. It's not clear if the incoming FBI director will pick up where Comey left off.\n\nAppointed by Obama, former Deputy Attorney General Yates had been running Trump's Justice Department as Acting Attorney General while Trump's nominee for the role, Sen. Jeff Sessions, awaited confirmation. She became a household name when Trump abruptlyremoved her from the temporary position.\n\n\"The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement at the time, explaining the President's actions.\n\nAs part of the probe into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump administration, then-acting Attorney General Yates met with White House counsel to inform them that then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn wasn't telling the truth about his interactions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and, as a result, represented a blackmail risk.\n\n\"We believed that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,\" Yates said in a Senate subcommittee hearing aimed at gathering details of the Russian hacking of the 2016 election on Monday in Washington.\n\n\"Logic would tell you that you don't want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him,\" she added.\n\n46 US attorneys Bharara first refused to resign along with 46 US attorneys across the country. Although it is common for incoming administrations to replace US attorneys when transitioning to power, Trump had previously assured Bharara that he'd keep his job.\n\nSources told CNN that Bharara had been told after a meeting with Trump in November that he could stay on, and that he felt blindsided by the request. He was fired after refusing to comply.\n\nBharara suggested that this was indeed the case. \"I wanted it to be on record that there was a deliberate decision to change (his) mind and fire me, particularly given what my office's jurisdiction is,\" he said."],[5,"Trump addresses London terror attack, says 'bloodshed must end'","President Trump said Sunday night the \"bloodshed must end,\" addressing the terror attack in London in remarks at a gala at Ford's Theatre in Washington.\n\nIn his first public spoken remarks on the attack, he described it as a \"horrific terrorist attack\" and said he spoke with UK Prime Minister Theresa May to express the United States' support, saying the U.S. will do everything in its power to \"being those that are guilty to justice.\"\n\n\"We renew our resolve, stronger than ever before, to protect the United States and its allies from a vile enemy that has waged war on innocent life. And it has gone on too long,\" he said. \"This bloodshed must end. This bloodshed will end. As president I will do what is necessary is to prevent this threat from spreading to our shores.\"\n\nIn his earlier response to the terror attack on Twitter, Trump took a different approach. In multiple Tweets on Sunday morning Trump pledged support for London but also invoked his controversial travel ban and seemed to criticize London Mayor Sadiq Khan for his response to the attack.\n\nIn response, Khan's spokesman called Trump's tweeted comment \"ill-informed.\""],[5,"Modi’s US visit: Will roll out the red carpet, says White House","Washington: President Donald Trump is eager to build on the momentum in U.S - India ties built over recent years and this resolve will be visible during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first meeting with him on Monday, a senior White House official said. “White House is very interested in making this visit special and really seeking to roll out the red carpet,” the official said, dismissing the suggestion that Mr. Trump’s courting of China has created a drift in U.S ties with India.   \n\n“It will be wrong to say that this administration is ignoring or not focussing on India. President Trump realizes that India is a force for good and that will come through in the visit on Monday,” the official said. Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will spend nearly five hours on Monday, starting with a one-on-one meeting at 3.30 pm, followed by a delegation level meeting, a cocktail reception and a working dinner, the official said, briefing on background. \n\nMr. Modi will be the first foreign dignitary who will be hosted by Mr. Trump for a White House dinner, the official said. Mr. Trump hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for state dinners at his private golf resort Mar-a-Lago in Florida.\n\nThe official said while defence cooperation will be accelerated and enhanced, cooperation in energy, particularly natural gas, will be a new thrust in bilateral ties under the Trump administration. New areas of anti-terrorism cooperation will be announced during the visit. “We can expect to see some new initiatives…more willingness to increase information sharing, data sharing, access to data bases, regarding terrorist activities..” said the official.\n\n“Defence trade strengthens both our countries’ security. It reinforces security partnership and allows our armed forces to cooperate more closely. Defence trade with India has created thousands of American jobs,” the official said.\n\nThe President considers India a critical partner in dealing with a variety of global challenges, the official said. “We believe that a strong India is good for the U.S,” said the official. “President wants to build on that,” the official said, referring to the previous administration’s measures to promote defence cooperation with India. The Obama administration had designated India as a ‘major defence partner,’ an undefined term. The White House official said there will be some “concrete expression of that designation” during the visit. Climate change cooperation between India and the U.S would continue under the Trump administration, the official said. “US has been a leader in clean energy technology, environmental protection, and this administration will continue that leadership,” said the official. \n\nThe official gave clear indication that the pending Indian request for 22 unarmed Guardian drones would be cleared during the visit. saying no comments could be made before the U.S Congress is notified.  The CEO of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, manufacturers of the UAV told Defense News that the sale has been cleared. “We are pleased that the U.S. government has cleared the way for the sale of the MQ-9B Guardian to the Indian Government,” said Linden Blue. “Guardian provides the endurance and capability required to significantly enhance India’s sovereign maritime domain awareness in the Indo-Pacific.

Click here to read the full statement)\n\nIn his statement, Comey breaks down his interactions with President Trump before and after he was inaugurated.\n\nThe five communications are broken down below:\n\nComey describes this as the first time he met then-President-Elect Donald Trump at his tower in New York. The meeting was meant, along with other leaders in the Intelligence Community “to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election.”\n\nThe then-FBI director stayed behind for a moment to talk to Trump about what he described “some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.”\n\n“The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified.”\n\nComey said he advised the president of said information because the media was to report about it, and any effort to compromise him “we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.”\n\nHe decided to brief Trump alone due to the sensitive nature of the allegations.\n\nDescribing the difference between counter-intelligence investigations and criminal investigative work, Comey provides context to Trump’s own words that the FBI wasn’t investigating him.\n\nComey then said he documented his first conversation in a memo immediately following the meeting.\n\n“Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone) – once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine one-on-one conversations with President Trump in four months – three in person and six on the phone.”\n\nThe second interaction Comey detailed about Trump was at a dinner in the Green Room at the White House.\n\nComey said he assumed others would be dining with them, but when he showed up, it was only the two of them.\n\nThe then-FBI director speaks to his instincts, noting the one-on-one interaction and the first discussion about his employment, \"meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship.\"\n\nThis concerned Comey.\n\nHe told the president he intended to serve his entire 10-year term, and he would always tell Trump the truth.\n\n\"I added that I was not on anybody’s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President.\"\n\nComey continues, \"A few moments later, the President said, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.'\"\n\n\"I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.\"\n\nComey said he explained the importance of the FBI and Department of Justice operating independent of the White House.\n\nThe opening statement reads, \"[Trump] then said, 'I need loyalty.' I replied, 'You will always get honesty from me.' He paused and then said, 'That’s what I want, honest loyalty.' I paused, and then said, 'You will get that from me.' As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase 'honest loyalty' differently, but I decided it wouldn’t be productive to push it further. The term – honest loyalty – had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect.\"\n\nAt the end of the dinner, Trump turned the conversation to the \"salacious material\" he received on January 6.\n\n\"He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn’t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren’t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.\"\n\nOn Valentines Day, Comey arrived to the Oval Office for a scheduled counter-terrorism briefing with the president.\n\nAlso in attendance: the vice president, deputy director of the CIA, director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General.\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump told everyone he wished to speak with Comey alone.\n\nOnce everyone had left, Trump told Comey he wanted to talk about Michael Flynn, who had resigned a day earlier.\n\n\"The President began by saying Flynn hadn’t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify.\"\n\nTrump then expressed concerns that Comey admits he still shares about leaks of classified information to the media. They ended the conversation with Trump returning to the subject of Flynn, expressing to Comey \"I hope you can let this go.\"\n\nComey recounts that he did not say he would \"let this go.\"\n\nLeadership speaking to the issue with Comey felt the president's request would not be shared with the investigative team.\n\nHe also states they did not intend to abide by the request.\n\n\"After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. The investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members – or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them – aware of the President’s request.\"\n\nComey said he assumed AG Jeff Sessions would likely recuse himself from any Russia-related investigations.\n\nThe former-FBI director then spoke with Sessions later in the day about leaks from the White House.\n\nThat's when Comey said he asked Sessions to \"prevent any future direct communication between the President and me.\"\n\nComey then describes a phone call he received from the president.\n\n\"He described the Russia investigation as “a cloud” that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia.\"\n\nTrump asked Comey what could be done to \"lift the cloud.\"\n\nThe president then asked Comey about the congressional hearing on Russia that took place the previous week.\n\nComey said he explained to the president that Congress was demanding more information - claiming Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) \"had even held up the confirmation of the deputy attorney general until we briefed him in detail on the investigation.\"\n\nThat's when Trump said \"we need to get that fact out.\"\n\nComey's opening statement he'll orate Thursday moves on to discuss conversations about FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and campaign donations.\n\nOnce the phone call ended, Comey said he reahed out to Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, as Sessions had recused himself.\n\nHe didn't hear back before his final interaction with Trump\n\nComey's final conversation with Trump was over the phone.\n\nThe president \"asked what I had done about his request that I 'get out' that he is not personally under investigation.\"\n\nAgain, Trump reiterated \"that 'the cloud' was getting in the way of his ability to do his job.\"\n\n\"He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel.\"\n\nTrump said he would heed Comey's advice:\n\nComey was fired as FBI director May 9."],[5,"12 pictures of Donald Trump looking awkward meeting world leaders","The Trump family have been jetting around the world this week, meeting dignitaries, discussing international security issues and clutching evil looking orbs.\n\nMost days tend to have a fairly sizeable chunk of the news cycle devoted to Mr Trump saying or tweeting something whacky and/or worrying - but now that he's gone mobile there seems to be no end of bizarre situations in the news.\n\nComedian Holly Walsh summed it up rather succinctly, on BBC Radio 4's The News Quiz, by saying \"Trump is currently travelling around the world with all the delicate international diplomacy of a swine flu epidemic\".\n\nSo, let's have a little look at some of the the more cringeworthy moments of US President's trip, shall we?\n\nIn Brussels he reunited with British Prime Minister Theresa May.

As Trump has sought input from outside advisers on whom he should keep and whom he should can, Kushner seems to operate as a faculty member with tenure in an otherwise insecure work environment.\n\nWith his wife, Ivanka Trump, according to multiple White House sources, Kushner emerged from the holiday weekend intent on dismissing his increased public scrutiny in connection with the FBI’s ongoing Russia probe as nothing more than a public relations problem that will blow over — and act like his special status in the White House has not changed.\n\nOn his first full day back after the holiday weekend, Kushner led a meeting on veterans affairs, a meeting with his Office of American Innovation and a planning meeting on a “Tech Day” at the White House next month, when he hopes to gather tech leaders in Washington to discuss modernizing government services. Kushner also conducted a series of follow-up phone calls about Trump’s just-concluded overseas trip, a White House official said.\n\nIvanka Trump, White House sources said, was also working out of her West Wing office on Tuesday, conducting business as usual — which includes a weekly communications meeting in her office. (Kushner and his wife, who both serve as official government employees, have chosen to run their own press shop as a separate entity from the Sean Spicer-led operation down the hall, relying on their own aides to handle queries from reporters.)\n\nThe New York Times reported Sunday that Kushner and Ivanka Trump were battened down at the Trump golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, as aides explained that Kushner has not been contacted by the FBI to discuss his role in allegedly trying to set up a back channel with the Russians. His attorney, Jamie Gorelick, reiterated her client’s interest in sharing with Congress any information he has about his meetings with Russian officials. But on Tuesday, they were back to work.\n\nAt Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm co-founded by Kushner’s younger brother, Josh, employees have sometimes, over the years, been greeted with motivational Post-It notes on their computer monitors, reminding them to keep their “heads down. Stay focused. Ignore the noise,” even when confronted with good news.\n\nIf Kushner wanted to communicate to concerned White House officials that the game plan was to tune out the noise and keep on working, he was far less explicit about it.\n\nThat left some unease in the White House about who, exactly, was in charge. Early Tuesday, after weeks of rumors about a shakeup in the White House press shop, communications director Michael Dubke made his resignation public. But staff members believe a bigger staff shakeup is looming — The Washington Post reported over the weekend that Trump associates were discussing shipping off chief of staff Reince Priebus to serve as ambassador to Greece.\n\nIn his first press briefing in over a week, press secretary Sean Spicer did not deny that Kushner had tried to set up a back channel with the Russians. “Mr. Kushner’s attorney has said that Mr. Kushner has volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings,” Spicer said. “And he will do the same if he’s contacted in or — and connected with any other inquiry.”\n\nWhen asked point blank whether the White House disputed the back channel reports, Spicer said that the question, posed by The Washington Post’s Phil Rucker, “presupposed facts that have not been confirmed.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump retweeted a Fox News story that downplayed Kushner’s relationship with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and reported that a permanent back channel was never discussed. That was the extent to which Trump himself has moved to defend his son-in-law, who was responsible for planning Trump’s successful visits to Saudi Arabia and Israel last week.\n\nBut the juxtaposition between his biggest hurdle arriving on the heels of his first measurable success in the White House isn’t new to Kushner. In his former office at 666 Fifth Avenue, the headquarters of his family real estate company, Kushner kept a framed photograph of the first page of Charles Dickens’ “A Tale of Two Cities,” according to a 2008 profile of Kushner published in the now-defunct Portfolio Magazine.\n\n“But when you think of this, you think, ‘It’s the best of times, it’s the worst of times,’” he said in the rare interview, referring to the first line of the Victorian novel. “But I love how we bought this building literally right after my father came out of prison, probably five, six months after. And the thought that I had was, ‘It’s kind of like the juxtaposition of going from the worst of times to the best of times.’”"],[5,"How Bannon and Pruitt boxed in Trump on climate pact","Donald Trump’s chief strategist and Environmental Protection Agency administrator maneuvered for months to get the president to exit the Paris climate accord, shrewdly playing to his populist instincts and publicly pressing the narrative that the nearly 200-nation deal was effectively dead — boxing in the president on one of his highest-profile decisions to date.\n\nSteve Bannon and Scott Pruitt have sought to outsmart the administration’s pro-Paris group of advisers, including Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who were hoping the president could be swayed by a global swell of support for the deal from major corporations, U.S. allies, Al Gore and even the pope. But some of that pro-Paris sentiment wound up being surprisingly tepid, according to White House aides who had expected that European leaders would make a stronger case during Trump’s trip abroad in May.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThose who want Trump to remain also faced an insurmountable hurdle: The president has long believed, rightly or wrongly, that the U.S. is getting a raw deal under the accord, and it proved nearly impossible to change his mind.\n\nThe internal reality show will culminate Thursday when Trump finally announces his decision, after a rush of leaks Wednesday from administration officials saying he was on the verge of pulling the plug on U.S. participation in history’s most comprehensive global climate agreement.\n\n\"I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M.,\" Trump tweeted Wednesday night, without revealing the outcome. \"The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nSome White House aides held out the prospect that the president still might take the middle course that Ivanka Trump and others had advocated — staying in the deal while drastically scaling back the Obama administration's nonbinding carbon cleanup promises. But three White House officials said Wednesday that they expect Trump to make a clean break by withdrawing from the agreement, though they noted it's possible the president will change his mind at the last minute.\n\nIn recent months, Pruitt and Bannon made sure Trump heard from a parade of conservative leaders and Republican lawmakers who raised concerns that the deal would hobble his pro-fossil-fuel energy agenda.\n\n\"We made very much the economic message argument,\" said Club for Growth President David McIntosh, whose group wrote letters to the White House and spoke to senior staff. \"It was bad for the U.S. economy. It would stifle economic growth and the United States should withdraw.\"\n\nAs the news of the impending decision spread Wednesday, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus began calling and fielding calls from lawmakers, indicating that the U.S. was unlikely to stay in the agreement, one person familiar with the conversations said.\n\nIf Trump withdraws, Paris’ foes will have Pruitt and Bannon to thank.\n\nOne Republican close to the White House called it the “classic split” and said conservative activists had flooded the White House in recent weeks, after seeing increasing chatter that Trump might stay in. This person said Bannon and Pruitt worked quietly to make sure Trump was hearing their side and touched base occasionally on political strategy to woo him.\n\n“You had the New Yorkers against it, and all the campaign loyalists for it,” this person said, referring to the push to withdraw. “When the New Yorkers get involved, it gets complicated for Trump and everyone else around him.”\n\nPruitt and Bannon have told others repeatedly for months that Trump will pull out of the agreement, as they aggressively pushed a narrative that they hoped would prove to be true, even as White House aides continued to debate the issue.\n\n“Some of the debate was for show to help the moderates feel like they had their say,” said one person who has spoken to Pruitt. “Pruitt has believed all along that this was never in doubt.”\n\nPruitt, who frequently attacked the EPA's regulations in court when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general, used his new post as EPA administrator to orchestrate an aggressive campaign to marshal conservative opposition to the Paris agreement.\n\nHe bashed the deal during a closed-door April meeting of the National Mining Association’s executive committee, telling the group that the agreement would hurt the economy. Pruitt’s staff also urged lawmakers and conservative groups to publicly criticize the agreement, sources familiar with the issue told POLITICO, which had the effect of increasing public pressure on Trump.\n\nBannon similarly argued in meetings with Trump and his team that the president would be breaking his campaign promise to “cancel” the agreement if he decided to remain. And he argued that the accord is a bad deal for the United States because other countries aren’t doing enough to curb their emissions.\n\nPruitt and Bannon’s anti-Paris campaign was meant to counter a separate offensive by members of the administration who supported staying in the pact, including Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\nIn recent months, Ivanka Trump set up a process in which the president would regularly hear from people who supported remaining in the agreement, according to administration officials.\n\nThe \"remain\" camp believed, perhaps naively, that Trump could be influenced by the support the Paris deal has received from major corporations, including Exxon Mobil, which Secretary of State Rex Tillerson led for more than a decade.\n\n“Ivanka is doing what she can to get him to stay,\" one official said. \"But that doesn't mean he's going to do it.\"\n\nWhite House aides outlined a plan to remain in the agreement while weakening former President Barack Obama’s pledge to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions. They made the case that Trump could use the goodwill generated from remaining to negotiate better economic incentives for fossil fuels, and they even won the buy-in of several coal companies that detested Obama’s climate policies.\n\nThey hoped European leaders could convince Trump he would risk damaging diplomatic relations if he withdrew. Ivanka Trump also brought Gore to Trump Tower to try to sway her father’s mind during the presidential transition, and Pope Francis handed the president a copy of his papal encyclical on climate change when the two men met at the Vatican last week.\n\nTrump took calls from a parade of business leaders and foreign leaders in recent weeks, most pressing him to remain, according to a senior administration official — and the calls continued on Wednesday.\n\n“He had tremendous pressure from international leaders, from members of his own Cabinet and advisers in the international sphere not to pull out of the accord because of the perceived loss of face,” said McIntosh, the Club for Growth president.\n\nBut while the leaders of G-7 nations all pressed Trump to remain in the agreement during last week’s summit in Italy, Paris supporters in the White House have privately groused that they didn’t make an aggressive enough case.\n\nEuropean officials countered they tried not to push Trump too much during the meetings, believing that a hard sell could backfire. And they were buoyed by early signals from White House officials ahead of the summit that Trump was open to remaining.\n\nIndeed, European officials received a series of mixed messages from Trump’s team during the summit. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, a Paris supporter and the only U.S. official permitted to attend meetings with G-7 leaders, told reporters that Trump was “evolving” on climate change, which many interpreted to mean that he would remain.\n\nWhite House officials chalked up Cohn’s comments to Trump’s habit of echoing the perspective of the last person he talked to. By that time, Bannon and other opponents of the agreement had returned to the United States. But Trump’s decision to delay a final verdict on the agreement gave Pruitt and Bannon a final opportunity to make their case. Pruitt met with Trump to discuss Paris on Tuesday.\n\nMost European officials were unwilling to comment about the prospect that Trump will withdraw, as they have not yet received official word from the White House and are still holding out hope that the president will change his mind.\n\nThe officials have already begun looking to other countries for support on climate change, with the European Union set to promise deeper cooperation with China. Some officials have even adopted a new informal nickname for the major remaining countries that support action on climate change: the G-6.\n\nSome Trump administration officials were reeling on Wednesday after the news first broke that Trump was prepared to withdraw.\n\nTrump had not officially told his entire team of senior aides he was considering leaving the agreement Wednesday when news leaked out. “Everyone assumed that’s what was going to happen, but we weren’t called all in and told, ‘Oh, we’re putting this story out today,” one person said.\n\nHaving learned a lesson after Trump changed his mind about pulling out of NAFTA, administration officials cautioned against definitive reporting, warning that the president is notoriously fickle. As administration officials began tamping down reports that Trump’s decision was final, White House aides were swamped with calls, emails and texts from lobbyists and diplomats seeking clarification.\n\nOfficials close to Trump sometimes leak information before it is final — hoping to back him into a corner, or believing that comments during a private meeting represent his ultimate view. White House officials put out word in April that he was pulling out of NAFTA, even though Trump had not made up his mind, and news leaked during the campaign that he would pick Mike Pence as his running mate even as he weighed other candidates.\n\n\"Sometimes people close to Trump put things into the media environment to see how he'll react to it,\" one adviser said. \"If your idea gets good coverage, it's likely to help him decide to go with what you're saying.\"\n\nOne of the biggest lingering questions: If he withdraws, how will Trump do it?\n\nHe could abide by the formal procedures in the underlying text of the agreement, which mandate that a formal withdrawal will not go into effect until Nov. 4, 2020, at the earliest. Or he could pull out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the underlying 1992 treaty that governs the negotiations, which would allow for a speedier pullout — a far more radical step that would see the U.S. abstain from the entire climate negotiating process.\n\nHe could also declare that the agreement is a treaty, which would require a two-thirds-majority ratification vote in the Senate that would certainly fail.\n\nWhatever he does, supporters of the climate agreement expect a harsh reaction from the United States’ friends if the country pulls out.\n\n“I think the diplomatic backlash will be worse than it was when the U.S. rejected Kyoto,” said Susan Biniaz, the State Department’s longtime former climate change lawyer, referring to the George W. Bush administration’s decision to spurn the 1997 Kyoto climate agreement.\n\nOne former U.S. official agreed: “Will global leaders trust the U.S. to negotiate a climate treaty ever again? After Kyoto and Paris, who will trust us to keep our word as a nation? Our credibility is gone.\""],[5,"After Mika Brzezinski tweet, Obama photographer trolls Trump","As a chorus of Democratic and Republican lawmakers slammed President Trump for “sexist” tweets about MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, a former White House chief photographer took to social media to troll the president, again.\n\nPete Souza, who chronicled the Obama presidency, shared a photo of an Oval Office meeting four women had with Barack Obama while he was president. The candid photo shows Obama sitting on his desk and gesturing while talking with the female staffers.\n\nSouza labeled the Instagram post: “Respect for women.”\n\nSouza also shared the photo on Twitter, a few hours after Trump unleashed a couple of tweets about Brzezinski and her co-host, Joe Scarborough. Trump called Brzezinski \"low I.Q.

Several lawmakers have taken to Twitter to rebuke Trump for his tweets, which many called sexist and unbecoming of the president of the United States.\n\nSouza, who has said his \"political leanings are Democratic,\" has previously trolled Trump by sharing photos that appear to show the men's stark differences.\n\nFor example, he shared a picture of Obama clasping the left hand of his wife, Michelle Obama, as the two listened to a speech in Selma, Ala. The short caption, \"holding hands,\" appears to be a slight at what Trump and first lady Melania Trump had just done — or not done, The Washington Post's Amy B.

One shows Melania Trump appearing to swat away her husband's hand after they arrived in Tel Aviv. In the other, she appears to avoid holding the president's hand after they landed in Rome.\n\nLast May, after The Post broke the news about Trump revealing highly classified information to Russian officials, Souza posted a photo of a folder marked “CLASSIFIED” on his former boss's desk. The caption: “Organized paperwork on the Resolute Desk, 2009.”\n\nThe subtext, wrote The Post's Emily Heil: Obama knew how to handle sensitive information.\n\nSouza, who also photographed the Reagan White House, has for months been sharing candid pictures he took of Obama over the past eight years. CNN described it as “a silent, social media, shade-throwing protest told in visuals.”\n\nAvi Selk and Amy B.

Trump focused on water infrastructure that is in “dire and even desperate” conditions, saying that improvements to the system have been “massively underfunded.”\n\n“More than half of American Steel is produced within 250 miles of where we are standing—and its production depends on the inland system,” Trump said. “Wait until you see what I’m going to do for you steel workers.”\n\nBehind the president during his remarks was a barge of West Virginia coal.\n\n“Coal miners like Trump…so do steel workers,” Trump said. “We are going to stop these other countries from coming in and killing our companies—American steel will get more and bigger.”\n\nTrump also spoke on the “ObamaCare catastrophe,” which he said was created by “congressional Democrats.”\n\n“The American people are paying much more for much worse coverage—the coverage is horrendous, it’s horrendous,” Trump said, calling the Affordable Care Act a “total death spiral.”\n\n“The problems will only get worse if Congress fails to act—Obamacare is dead,” Trump said, adding that Republicans are working “hard” on getting a “great plan.”\n\n“Now it’s the Senate’s turn to act –I hope they’re going to act in a very positive manner,” Trump said. “The Republican senators are trying hard—the Democrats are really in our way.” \n\nJust moments before the president began his speech, the Senate Intelligence Committee in Washington was hearing testimony from Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, National Security Agency Adm. Mike Rogers, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that was scheduled to focus on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But the hearing ultimately served as a prelude to Thursday’s long-awaited testimony by fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nThe White House has been fielding questions on the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion with members of the Trump campaign for months, and now, officials are directing all inquiries on the matter to the president’s outside counsel, long-time New York-based attorney Marc Kasowitz in an effort to keep the administration on track with policy introduction and implementation.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump unveiled his plan to privatize America’s air traffic control system and separate it from the FAA due to the agency’s “antiquated” practices, and move towards a system that could keep pace with the fast-changing aviation industry.  \n\nThe infrastructure plan was one that could have received bipartisan support, but based on Democrats’ reaction to the president’s budget for FY18, that does not seem likely.\n\nIn January, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., rolled out his version of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that would create 15 million jobs over the next 10 years.\n\nSchumer said that after meeting with Trump, he seemed “willing” to work moving forward, and called on Republicans in both the House and the Senate to “get on board.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in January, was against borrowing “a trillion dollars,” saying Schumer’s plan was a “replication” of the Obama stimulus package in 2009. Since then, McConnell has said he looks forward to working with the administration to “protect and improve” infrastructure that “serve people and jobs across the country.”\n\nBut on Wednesday, the White House said that the “difference” between the presidents’ proposal and Obama’s stimulus is the “focus on accountability of how federal tax dollars will be spent,” and that the stimulus approach resulted in states substituting federal highway dollars for state dollars.\n\n“Working with states, local governments, and private industry, we will ensure that these new federal funds are matched by significant additional dollars for maximum efficiency and accountability,” Trump said.\n\nTrump deviated from infrastructure and spoke on combatting terrorism, his decision to exit the Paris Climate Accord, and touted the administration’s plan to give the “largest tax cut in history.”\n\n“We’re getting rid of regulations and streamlining approval processes, expediting environmental reviews—thousands and thousands of big, big jobs, thousands of them are being approved rapidly,” Trump said.\n\nHe added: “We will build American, we will hire American – we will not let our nation become a museum of former glory, we will build new ones for American grit- we will build because our people want to build, and we need them to build because our prosperity demands it—that is how we make America great again.” \n\nFox News' Serafin Gomez contributed to this report."],[5,"Paris Agreement: Macron joins world leaders in vowing to 'make planet great again' after Trump quits climate accord","French President Emmanuel Macron has said “there is no Plan B” on climate change, declaring that “there is no way” that France will negotiate a less ambitious climate deal after US President Donald Trump announced he is withdrawing America from the Paris accord. \n\nThe leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement saying they regretted Mr Trump's decision to pull out of the agreement, which was designed to avoid catastrophic levels of climate change fuelled by human activity. \n\nThe UK reportedly declined to put its name to the statement, but the Prime Minister, Theresa May, said she had phoned the President to express her \"disappointment\" at the decision.\n\nIn an English-language speech from the presidential palace, unprecedented from a French president in an address at home, Mr Macron said: \"I do respect this decision but I do think it is an actual mistake both for the US and for our planet.\"\n\nIn a riff on Mr Trump's pledge to 'Make America Great Again', Mr Macron added: \"Wherever we live, whoever we are, we all share the same responsibility: make our planet great again.\"\n\nCalling the President’s decision “a mistake” for the US as well as the planet, Mr Macron urged climate change scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs to go to France to continue their work.“They will find in France a second homeland,” Mr Macron said.  \n\n“I call on them,” he added. “Come and work here with us, work together on concrete solutions for our climate, our environment. I can assure you, France will not give up the fight.”\n\nIn his announcement at the White House, Mr Trump said he wants to “renegotiate” a fairer deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.\n\nThe President said that by pulling out of the pact – which has been signed by almost 200 nations – he is keeping his campaign promise to stop international agreements that he believes disadvantage the US.\n\nHe said that “if we can get a deal, that's great. If not, that's fine.”\n\nEarlier, France had released a rare joint statement with Italy and Germany that dismissed Mr Trump’s suggestion that the Paris accord could be altered.  \n\n“We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies,” the leaders of the three countries said.\n\nThat statement followed a swift outcry from politicians including the former US President Barack Obama – whose administration negotiated the deal.\n\nThe EU's top climate change official, Miguel Arias Canente, said in a statement that Mr Trump's decision to leave the Paris accord made it \"a sad day for the global community,\" adding that the bloc \"deeply regrets the unilateral decision.\" \n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the US withdrawal \"a major disappointment\" and said it was \"crucial that the US remains a leader on environmental issues,\" according to his spokesman. \n\nIn November, Fiji's Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama will be in Germany to chair the UN's annual climate summit. He said Mr Trump's decision was a grave disappointment for places like his Pacific island nation and US coastal cities like New York and Miami that are vulnerable to climate change. \n\nHe said he was deeply disappointed by Mr Trump's decision and did what he could to try to persuade Mr Trump to stick with the agreement as nations tackle \"the greatest challenge our planet has ever faced\". He said he was convinced the US will eventually rejoin. \n\nBefore Trump announced his decision Thursday afternoon, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters during a visit to Berlin that fighting global warming was a \"global consensus\" and an \"international responsibility.\" \n\nJapan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea also regretted the US move and reiterated their commitment to implement the agreement.\n\nSpeaking in Tokyo the Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, angrily suggested the decision showed America's chronic failure to commit. He compared Mr Trump's move to America's historic role in establishing the abortive League of Nations after the First World War. He described a pattern of the US helping set up initiatives before dropping out of them, adding: \"I think that's just how they are.\""],[5,"Kathy Griffin Apologizes For 'Disturbing' Image Of President Trump's Head","Updated at 2:25 p.m. ET\n\nCNN is cutting ties with comedian Kathy Griffin after she was photographed posing with a model of President Trump's head covered in blood.\n\nThe photo and video were first posted Tuesday morning by TMZ; Griffin apologized Tuesday evening but by then the image had already been widely shared and condemned.\n\nFor the past decade, Griffin has been a staple on CNN's annual New Year's Eve coverage alongside Anderson Cooper.

Comey is going to testify in front of the Senate committee investigating Russia meddling, specifically about what he says President Trump asked him to do with regard to the investigation. The Senate Intelligence Committee just released Comey's prepared testimony, and it is remarkable. The Fix has annotated some key parts. To read them, click on a highlighted text, go to the top right corner of your screen, select \"all annotations,\" and read away. Oh, and sign up for a Genius account to add your own.\n\nStatement for the Record Senate Select Committee on Intelligence James B. Comey June 8, 2017\n\nChairman Burr, Ranking Member Warner, Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I was asked to testify today to describe for you my interactions with President-Elect and President Trump on subjects that I understand are of interest to you. I have not included every detail from my conversations with the President, but, to the best of my recollection, I have tried to include information that may be relevant to the Committee.\n\nJanuary 6 Briefing\n\nI first met then-President-Elect Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President-Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.\n\nThe IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.\n\nThe Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I was staying in my position and because the material implicated the FBI’s counter-intelligence responsibilities. We also agreed I would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the President-Elect. Although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing, the FBI’s leadership and I were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new President came into office uncertain about whether the FBI was conducting a counter-intelligence investigation of his personal conduct.\n\nIt is important to understand that FBI counter-intelligence investigations are different than the more-commonly known criminal investigative work. The Bureau’s goal in a counter-intelligence investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the United States or to steal our secrets. The FBI uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts. Sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power. Sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked. Sometimes it involves “turning” the recruited person into a double-agent, or publicly calling out the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of embassy-based intelligence officers. On occasion, criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities.\n\nBecause the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known, counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the FBI suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power. When the FBI develops reason to believe an American has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power, the FBI will “open an investigation” on that American and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted.\n\nIn that context, prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBI’s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, based on President-Elect Trump’s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance.\n\nI felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone) – once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine one-on-one conversations with President Trump in four months – three in person and six on the phone.\n\nJanuary 27 Dinner\n\nThe President and I had dinner on Friday, January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House. He had called me at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night, saying he was going to invite my whole family, but decided to have just me this time, with the whole family coming the next time. It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner, although I assumed there would be others.\n\nIt turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks.\n\nThe President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to. He said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse I had taken during the previous year, he would understand if I wanted to walk away.\n\nMy instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI’s traditionally independent status in the executive branch.\n\nI replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my ten-year term as Director. And then, because the set-up made me uneasy, I added that I was not “reliable” in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. I added that I was not on anybody’s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President.\n\nA few moments later, the President said, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.\n\nAt one point, I explained why it was so important that the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent of the White House. I said it was a paradox: Throughout history, some Presidents have decided that because “problems” come from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work.\n\nNear the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said, “I need loyalty.” I replied, “You will always get honesty from me.” He paused and then said, “That’s what I want, honest loyalty.” I paused, and then said, “You will get that from me.” As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase “honest loyalty” differently, but I decided it wouldn’t be productive to push it further. The term – honest loyalty – had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect.\n\nDuring the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn’t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren’t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.\n\nAs was my practice for conversations with President Trump, I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the FBI.\n\nFebruary 14 Oval Office Meeting\n\nOn February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President. He sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a semi-circle of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk. The Vice President, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the National CounterTerrorism Center, Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and I were in the semi-circle of chairs. I was directly facing the President, sitting between the Deputy CIA Director and the Director of NCTC. There were quite a few others in the room, sitting behind us on couches and chairs.\n\nThe President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me. The last person to leave was Jared Kushner, who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. The President then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me.\n\nWhen the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, “I want to talk about Mike Flynn.” Flynn had resigned the previous day. The President began by saying Flynn hadn’t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify.\n\nThe President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information – a concern I shared and still share. After he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks, Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind him. The President waved at him to close the door, saying he would be done shortly. The door closed.\n\nThe President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, “He is a good guy and has been through a lot.” He repeated that Flynn hadn’t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” I replied only that “he is a good guy.” (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would “let this go.”\n\nThe President returned briefly to the problem of leaks. I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President.\n\nI immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn’s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBI’s role as an independent investigative agency.\n\nThe FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the President’s request, which we did not intend to abide. We also concluded that, given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related investigations. (He did so two weeks later.) The Deputy Attorney General’s role was then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney, who would also not be long in the role. After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. The investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members – or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them – aware of the President’s request.\n\nShortly afterwards, I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to pass along the President’s concerns about leaks. I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened – him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind – was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply. For the reasons discussed above, I did not mention that the President broached the FBI’s potential investigation of General Flynn.\n\nMarch 30 Phone Call\n\nOn the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as “a cloud” that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to “lift the cloud.” I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him.\n\nThen the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week – at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, “We need to get that fact out.” (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)\n\nThe President went on to say that if there were some “satellite” associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn’t done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we weren’t investigating him.\n\nIn an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadn’t brought up “the McCabe thing” because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe’s wife) campaign money. Although I didn’t understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person.\n\nHe finished by stressing “the cloud” that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn’t being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could.\n\nImmediately after that conversation, I called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had by then recused himself on all Russia-related matters), to report the substance of the call from the President, and said I would await his guidance. I did not hear back from him before the President called me again two weeks later.\n\nApril 11 Phone Call\n\nOn the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I “get out” that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that “the cloud” was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel.\n\nHe said he would do that and added, “Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.” I did not reply or ask him what he meant by “that thing.” I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended.\n\nThat was the last time I spoke with President Trump."],[5,"John Oliver: Everything Trump Said Re Paris Accord Was False","There's no nice way to put it, which is great for John Oliver.\n\nDonald Trump's Rose Garden statement on the Paris Climate Accord had not one true word in it.

Al Green (Tex.) — the seven-term Democrat from Houston who held a hometown news conference two days before calling for the impeachment of President Trump. Then came allegations that Trump had pressured the FBI director to beg off a criminal investigation of his then-national security adviser — and then came the media.\n\nGreen delivered a morning floor speech on impeachment (“with a heavy heart, with a sense of duty”), then spent nearly an hour just outside the House chamber, walking from camera to camera near the Capitol’s statue of Will Rogers, where TV networks set up their satellite links.\n\n“It’s about the fact that the president has committed obstruction of justice,” Green, a former trial lawyer, said in an interview. “It is indisputable that he fired the FBI director. It is indisputable that he said he considered the investigation that was taking place — of the president — when he fired him. And it’s indisputable that he went on to tweet what might be considered intimidation, words that are intimidating.”\n\nFor much of a frenzied day, Democrats and Republicans were asked not just whether there needed to be further investigations of the president, but whether impeachment, a power Congress has used against just three of its 45 presidents, was on their minds.\n\nIt was unclear how the Justice Department’s decision to appoint Robert S. Mueller III as a special counsel to oversee allegations of Russian meddling in the election would affect such talk. As of earlier Wednesday, neither party’s leaders wanted to talk about impeachment. But neither party could seem to avoid it.\n\n“I think that we ought to keep our focus on finding out the facts,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, at a morning news conference meant to tout the Democrats’ campaign to form an independent commission on the FBI scandal. “No one ought to, in my view, rush to embrace the most extraordinary remedy that involves the removal of the president from office.”\n\nThe impeachment talk had already begun at the fringes of the Democratic Party before this week — Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) was leading the charge. But despite the Mueller announcement, the noise grew louder after news that ousted FBI Director James B. Comey took notes of his conversation with Trump, during which the president asked Comey to drop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, according to Comey’s associates.\n\nAs with so much of Congress’s agenda, whether to talk impeachment seems to have been a choice that outside forces had already made for lawmakers. At a Monday night town hall sponsored by CNN, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was prodded on the impeachment question, and she stayed with the party’s message: an investigation would uncover facts, and impeachment made no sense without it.\n\n“If you are talking about impeachment, you are talking about, ‘What are the facts?’ ” she said. “What are the facts that you would make a case on? What are the rules that he may have violated? If you don’t have that case, you are just participating in more hearsay.”\n\nFor that, Pelosi was flayed on Twitter by left-wing accounts. And by midweek, the progressive group MoveOn.org was texting members, urging them to ask their representatives to “start an independent investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice and begin impeachment if he did.” Democratic candidates for other offices, like Illinois gubernatorial hopeful J.B. Pritzker, were flashing their progressive bona fides by calling for impeachment.\n\n“Calling for impeachment is not something done lightly, but I believe it’s necessary to protect our country’s national security and democracy,” Pritzker wrote on Twitter. “There are credible reports that Donald Trump has obstructed justice in the investigation of the Russian hacking of our democracy.”\n\nPelosi, who led her party to control of the House from 2007 to 2011, had heard the impeachment drumbeat before. The 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton, which led to a failed removal vote in the Senate, left Democrats with bitter memories. Throughout George W. Bush’s presidency, activists called for his impeachment. In 2006, Pelosi repeatedly said that impeachment was “off the table,” and in the end, all activists got from the campaign was a day-long hearing during which one witness suggested that rather than face impeachment, Bush should be tried for murder.\n\nBut “the I-word,” as Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) called it Wednesday, remains the gold standard when presidents tumble into scandal.\n\n“Maybe it’s the shock value,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), a progressive who spent part of the day batting back impeachment questions.\n\n“Most people calling our offices are asking for a special prosecutor,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the chair of a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which next year has to defend 10 senators from states that Trump won.\n\nRepublicans, who egged on impeachment talk in the Bush years, are cautiously sounding the same notes now. In an email to donors, headlined “Sabotage,” the Trump reelection campaign warned conservatives of a campaign to bring down his presidency.\n\n“You already knew the media was out to get us,” the email read. “But sadly it’s not just the fake news . . . There are people within our own unelected bureaucracy that want to sabotage President Trump and our entire America First movement.”\n\nIn conservative media, coverage of Green’s speech was sometimes apocalyptic. On Fox News, the story was “Dems, Media Bring Up Impeachment.” At the other end of the pro-Trump spectrum, the fringe site Infowars informed readers that “Impeachment of Trump Could Lead to Mass Riots This Summer.”\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) who co-sponsored impeachment resolutions against Bush and against former vice president Richard B. Cheney, said that the politics and realities of 2017 were completely different. Trump struggled to win over Republican leaders up until he won the presidency — and she thought a botched lunge at his presidency would firm up Republican support in a more partisan media environment than Bill Clinton or even Richard Nixon ever faced.\n\n“They’re saying, oh, this whole thing is proof that Democrats lost the election, and they want to find another way to get rid of Trump,” Schakowsky said. “What we need is a bipartisan or nonpartisan look at this, so there’s a consensus about where we go. Maybe impeachment is where it ends up. But transparency and independence is where to focus right now.”\n\nRep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), who said that “nobody” in his district was asking for an impeachment, was just as wary about the media dynamic. “There are a lot of Republicans that think that no matter what this person does he ought to be allowed to do what he wants to do, that he has the authority to hire and fire,” he said. “I think that we ought to wait to see where the facts will lead us.”\n\nStill, the impeachment question made news whenever it was asked. On Wednesday, after a meeting of the House GOP Conference, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) raced up the stairs of the Cannon House Office Building, fielding questions from a stubborn pack of reporters. He was just one of two Republicans open to a special probe of the fallout from alleged Russian meddling, and reporters tested how much further he could go.\n\n“If the allegations are true, would they be grounds for impeachment?” asked one reporter.\n\n“If the allegations are true, yes,” said Amash. “But everybody in this country gets a fair trial, including the president, or anyone else.”\n\nFor the rest of Wednesday, Amash — an iconoclast who wrote in the name of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) for president — was famous. The Hill ran a news alert: “First Republican raises impeachment for Trump.” A video of Amash answering the question bounced over Twitter.\n\nMeanwhile, Mother Jones reported to its progressive audience that Amash was the first Republican to suggest that “Trump may have committed [an] impeachable offense.” The magazine updated its item after a spokesman for Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said that he, not Amash, was the first to mull over impeachment — after a reporter asked about it."],[5,"Donald Trump Suggests ‘Second Amendment People’ Could Act Against Hillary Clinton","Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, would “pick her judges” to threaten the Second Amendment.\n\nWILMINGTON, N.C. — Donald J. Trump on Tuesday appeared to raise the possibility that gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands if Hillary Clinton is elected president and appoints judges who favor stricter gun control measures.\n\nRepeating his contention that Mrs. Clinton wanted to abolish the right to bear arms, Mr. Trump warned at a rally here that it would be “a horrible day” if Mrs. Clinton were elected and got to appoint a tiebreaking Supreme Court justice.\n\n“If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: “Although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don’t know.”\n\nOblique as it was, Mr. Trump’s remark quickly elicited a wave of condemnation from Democrats, gun control advocates and others, who accused him of suggesting violence against Mrs. Clinton or liberal jurists. Bernice A. King, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., called Mr. Trump’s words “distasteful, disturbing, dangerous.”\n\nMrs. Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, expressed disbelief. “Nobody who is seeking a leadership position, especially the presidency, the leadership of the country, should do anything to countenance violence, and that’s what he was saying,” Mr. Kaine said in Austin, Tex. He called Mr. Trump’s remark “a window into the soul of a person who is just temperamentally not suited to the task.”\n\nAnd Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said Mr. Trump’s statement was “repulsive — literally using the Second Amendment as cover to encourage people to kill someone with whom they disagree.”\n\n“For Trump, violence has become a standard talking point, a common punch line, and even a campaign strategy,” Mr. Gross said.\n\nPaul D. Ryan, the Republican House speaker who has had a tense relationship with Mr. Trump, told reporters on Tuesday night that the remarks sounded “like a joke gone bad.”\n\nHe added: “You should never joke about that. I hope he clears it up quickly.”\n\nMr. Trump and his campaign did not treat his remark as a joke; instead, they insisted he was merely urging gun rights supporters to vote as a bloc against Mrs. Clinton. “The Second Amendment people have tremendous power because they are so united,” he told a CBS affiliate in North Carolina late Tuesday.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump grew adamant. “There can be no other interpretation,” he said, adding, “I mean, give me a break.”\n\nBut at his rally earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had actually been discussing what could happen once Mrs. Clinton was president, not before the election.\n\nAnd even many in the audience seemed caught by surprise. Video showed a man just over Mr. Trump’s shoulder go slack-jawed and turn to his companion, apparently in disbelief, when Mr. Trump made the remark.\n\nThe uproar over Mr. Trump’s off-the-cuff remark came as his campaign has been faced with a series of public opinion surveys showing him quickly losing ground to Mrs. Clinton, and just a day after his campaign called his delivery of a prepared economic speech in Detroit, evidence of a newfound political discipline.\n\nMr. Trump’s fellow opponents of gun control stood by him, focusing on his depiction of Mrs. Clinton as a threat to the Second Amendment.\n\n“Donald Trump is absolutely correct,” said Jennifer Baker, a strategist for the National Rifle Association. “If Hillary Clinton is elected, there is nothing we can do to stop her from nominating an anti-gun Supreme Court justice who will vote to overturn the individual right of law-abiding citizens to own a gun in their home for protection.”\n\nThe association also began running a new commercial characterizing Mrs. Clinton as “one of the wealthiest women in politics” and calling her a hypocrite for favoring gun restrictions while having been “protected by armed guards for 30 years.” Her gun policies, the ad says, would leave ordinary people “defenseless.”\n\nVeiled references to gun violence have tripped up candidates before. In 2010, Sharron Angle, a Nevada Republican challenging the Senate majority leader at the time, Harry Reid, severely damaged her unsuccessful candidacy while discussing the importance of the Second Amendment. “When you read that Constitution and the founding fathers, they intended this to stop tyranny,” she said, adding: “It’s to defend ourselves. And you know, I’m hoping that we’re not getting to Second Amendment remedies. I hope the vote will be the cure for the Harry Reid problems.”\n\nMrs. Clinton herself learned the hard way: In June 2008, shortly before she conceded defeat in her Democratic primary contest with Barack Obama, she defended her perseverance in a way that critics said alluded to the possibility that Mr. Obama could be gunned down. “We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California,” Mrs. Clinton said. She apologized hours later.\n\nMr. Trump did not repeat his violent insinuation at a later event in Fayetteville, N.C.\n\nBut Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who has championed gun control since the Sandy Hook mass shooting in his state, called Mr. Trump’s remarks “disgusting and embarrassing and sad.”\n\n“This isn’t play,” Mr. Murphy wrote. “Unstable people with powerful guns and an unhinged hatred for Hillary are listening to you, @realDonaldTrump.”\n\nThe condemnation from Mr. Trump’s critics across the political spectrum was deep. On Twitter, the conservative writer John Podhoretz, in a series of posts, wrote that Mr. Trump had implied that all Second Amendment supporters were “potential assassins.” He added that a president’s words “CANNOT MEAN NOTHING. They are the most important words spoken in the world.”\n\nAnd Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, wrote on Twitter that the Secret Service should investigate Mr. Trump for making a death threat against Mrs. Clinton: “Donald Trump suggested someone kill Sec. Clinton. We must take people at their word.”\n\nA Secret Service spokesman, who refused to identify himself, said that the agency was “aware of the comments” but did not elaborate.\n\nOthers seized on Mr. Trump’s remark as an occasion for mockery. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump “makes death threats because he’s a pathetic coward who can’t handle the fact that he’s losing to a girl.”\n\nMr. Trump’s campaign events have grown increasingly vitriolic, with angry chants and jeers directed at Mrs. Clinton. People at his rallies have, with greater frequency, loudly called for violence against Mrs. Clinton — catcalls that Mr. Trump has generally let pass.\n\nAnd on Saturday, Mr. Trump praised his New Hampshire state co-chairman, State Representative Al Baldasaro, who said recently that Mrs. Clinton deserved to face a firing squad over the F.B.I.’s investigation of her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\n\nIn Wilmington on Tuesday, chants of “lock her up,” which first gained traction during the Republican National Convention, were loud and frequent before Mr. Trump took the stage. But one speaker, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, tried to tamp those down.\n\n“No, no, we’re here to beat her, and keep her out of Washington,” Mr. Giuliani said. He was interrupted by the same chant minutes later."],[5,"Trump’s Approval Rating Is Even Lower Globally, and He’s Destroying the U.S.’s Reputation","Mired in record low approval ratings at home, President Donald Trump is even less popular globally, with a majority describing him as dangerous, arrogant and intolerant. Those are the results of the Pew Research Center’s annual survey on global attitudes toward the United States and its president, released Monday.\n\nIt found that, across the 37 countries surveyed, a median of just 22 percent had confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. Seventy-four percent said they had no confidence in the Republican. Adding insult to injury for the former real estate magnate, global confidence in the man residing in the Oval Office has plummeted since Trump became president.\n\nTrump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, was viewed favorably by a median of 64 percent at the end of his second four-year term.\n\nThat dramatic shift has taken its toll on the image of the U.S. across the globe. A median of 49 percent now have a favorable opinion of the U.S., down from 64 percent at the end of Obama’s presidency.\n\nConfidence in the U.S. president has taken a particularly severe hit among many of the country's closest allies: Germany, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan and Canada.\n\nOnly 5 percent of Mexicans surveyed had confidence in Trump, in large part due to his stated intention to build a wall along the entirety of the U.S.-Mexico border. A full 94 percent of Mexicans said they opposed that plan. But opposition is not limited to Mexico: A median of 76 percent across the 37 countries surveyed said they did not approve of it.\n\nIndeed, all of the major policy proposals featured in the survey had a higher median percentage of opposition than of favor. Other policy ideas mentioned include the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, ending support for major trade agreements, Trump’s executive order banning travel from six Muslim-majority countries and withdrawal from international climate agreements.\n\nThe survey was taken before Trump, who has proclaimed a slogan of \"America First,\" formally announced the United States’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, meaning his international standing may have sunk even further. That decision was greeted with widespread condemnation internationally.\n\nTrump’s ratings in many countries, notably in Western Europe, now bear a striking resemblance to those endured by George W. Bush during his two terms, in which the United States’s international reputation took a severe hit.\n\nEven Russian President Vladimir Putin, considered an adversary in many of the countries surveyed, enjoys a healthier global reputation. Compared to Trump’s 22 percent, a median of 27 percent had confidence in Putin to do the right thing regarding world affairs. Chinese President Xi Jinping was slightly higher, at 28 percent. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was trusted by 42 percent, compared with 31 percent who said they had no confidence.\n\nIn a further indictment of Trump’s international reputation, a median of 75 percent said they believed Trump was arrogant. The views on Trump’s other characteristics do not get any better. A median of 65 percent said he was intolerant, and 62 percent said he was dangerous.\n\nAnd while much of his notoriety before running for president was based on his stint as a personality on reality television, just 39 percent considered Trump charismatic. Even less—a median of 26 percent—said he was well qualified for the job of president. Only 26 percent believed that Trump’s major campaign talking point (caring for ordinary people) was genuine.\n\nArguably, the sole piece of good news for Trump from the survey was that a median of 55 percent said he was a strong leader.\n\nGiven Trump's repeated war of words with his predecessor, though, it is the negative comparisons with Obama that may sting most. Notably, Trump inspired more confidence than Obama in just two countries: Russia and Israel."],[5,"A coup in real time? Historian Timothy Snyder says the Comey firing is Trump’s “open admission of collusion with Russia”","I wrote the first article about Trump and Russia 13 months ago, using Russian sources. The evidence has been overwhelming for a long time. I think it is only our basic desire to cling to some familiar reality that prevented us from seeing all this in 2016. The man shared his political advisers with the Kremlin and Ukrainian oligarchs. Trump owed his success as a developer to mysterious inflows of Russian cash. He won on the Internet thanks in part to Russian trolls, bots, and fake news. Some of that information war ran through Cambridge Analytica, where Steve Bannon was on the board.\n\nTrump's first foreign policy speech was written by someone on the payroll of a Russian fossil fuels company. Carter Page was also working for the Russians. And that's not even considering what has come to light about Michael Flynn. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner failed to mention his own Russian contacts to get security clearance. Sessions also lied by omission, perjuring himself to become attorney general, about his Russian contacts. And on and on.\n\nTrump's whole campaign was an imitation of Putin's political style, punctuated by pathetic appeals to Putin for friendship. This is what is known through English-language open sources. When you include that Russia has been carrying out operations to derail democracy and support favored candidates elsewhere, the pattern takes shape."],[5,"Kathy Griffin claims Trump family ruined her life","Kathy Griffin accused President Donald Trump and his family of launching a campaign to destroy her life in response to the image she posted earlier this week in which she appeared to be holding the commander-in-chief's severed head. \n\nThe comedian broke down in tears as she detailed the torrent of abuse she has been receiving online, and the constant death threats which she described as detailed and specific.\n\nShe stated however that she will not back down from this fight, saying: 'I am not afraid of Donald Trump. He is a bully.' \n\nLater in the interview Griffin said that her career was likely over now as a result of this incident, and that President Trump had 'broke' her, moments after she declared: 'There's a bunch of old white guys trying to silence me!'\n\nGriffin, 56, declared at one point that this would not be happening to her if she was a 'white man.' \n\nHer lawyer Lisa Bloom also suggested during the press conference that despite reports, Barron was likely not that upset after seeing the image of Griffin with the decapitated head by stating the child was 'allegedly' traumatized.\n\n'We don't know that. You're assuming that everything that Trump says is true, and in fact, we know that everything Trump says is false,' said Bloom. \n\nIt was also confirmed at the press conference that the Secret Service is investigating Griffin over the image, with the comedian saying: 'Yeah I might get arrested today. I don't care.'\n\nGriffin's criminal lawyer Dimitry Goran also joined her Friday.\n\nScroll down for video \n\n'I am really nervous, I have never done a press conference,' said Griffin after she  was introduced by her lawyer.\n\nAfter making a few jokes and stating that she stands by the apology she released earlier this week, Griffin said: 'The president and his grown children and the first lady are personally trying to ruin my life forever.'\n\nShe then went back to that notion a few moments later, speaking in disbelief as she reiterated her claim that 'this president of all people is going to come after' an 'obnoxious comedian.'\n\nGriffin also tried to explain the reason behind the photo and video shoot by saying: 'I am not good at being appropriate.'\n\nThat became clear soon after when she announced that she would not stop attacking President Trump just because he had targeted her.\n\n'I am going to make fun of him more now,' said Griffin.\n\nShe then made a point of adding: 'I am not going to threaten him, I have no desire to harm him.'\n\nGriffin was also ready with some thoughts on why President Trump had elected to attack her while his son Don Jr. called for her to be fired from her jobs.\n\n'They are using me as the shining object so no one talks about his FBI investigation,' said Griffin. \n\nShe then revealed that all she wanted to do was get back to work, something that is becoming difficult with five venues cancelling her show in the wake of the incident. \n\n'I'm not for everybody,. I am barely an acquired taste frankly,' admitted Griffin.\n\n'I've had everybody turn on me. And I just want to make people laugh.'\n\nThat being said, Griffin declared: 'I am not laying down for this guy.' \n\nShe later added towards the end of the press conference: 'It's a good time to be a comedian but a scary time to be a citizen.'\n\nThe comedian did not however say anything about her relationship with President Trump, who she has known for 20 years. \n\nShe also worked with him multiple times over the course of her career, most recently in the 2010 finale of 'The Apprentice,' where she also appeared alongside Ivanka and Don Jr. \n\nGriffin also said that it was Megyn Kelly who inspired her to take the image, saying: 'I started thinking of that Megyn Kelly thing. By the way, I'm sure Megyn Kelly can't stand me.I thought of that blood coming out of her eyes blood or coming out of her wherever.'\n\nThe comedian and Kelly previously had a run-in this past December at a Women In Hollywood breakfast.\n\nKelly was the emcee of the event, and when she began to speak about President Trump things took a turn. \n\n'I have high hopes for him. Despite the tweets and all the rest of it, there is much to admire about Donald Trump,' said Kelly, which immediately elicited booing from a few people, the loudest being comedian Kathy Griffin.\n\n'There is. Stop that, stop that. There’s room for the loyal opposition in this country,' said Kelly at that point, a comment which resulted in Griffin screaming, 'F*** him.'\n\nKelly then responded: 'Guess who that is? Kathy Griffin.' \n\nGriffin later explained how things went down the day of the shoot.\n\n'Let's make this really obvious that I'm making an absurdist, artsy thing,' said Griffin. \n\n'For a few photos, I was holding up this wig head and we kept making the hair crazier.'\n\nShe went on to explain: ' We just took these pictures, it was interesting. There were a few people in the house. I didn't do anything for money.'\n\nGriffin said she just wanted to give people something to talk about, adding: 'You interpret it the way you want.'\n\nIt was an emotional appearance for Griffin, who most difficult moment came when she began to wail while saying of President Trump: 'He broke me. He broke me. He broke me.'\n\nThat was when Griffin said she realized that 'this isn't right.'\n\n'I've dealt with white guys trying to keep me down my entire career,' said Griffin. \n\n'I had learned over the years that sometimes when you do standup, people want a joke that's out there and a little crazy.'\n\nShe went on to say: 'I feel horrible. I have performed in war zones. Trust me, if we could redo the whole thing I'd have a blowup doll and ketchup. If you don't stand up you get run over.'\n\nThus far, Griffin had had five tour dates cancelled, lost her endorsement deal with Squatty Potty and been fired by CNN.\n\nGriffin also found some time for humor, joking about President Trump at one point by saying: 'If you meet him he wants to call you The Donald. I said I am The Kathy, and that went over his nest.' \n\nShe also poked fun at her conservative mother Maggie, quipping: 'My mother is not speaking to me because she is in love with Tucker Carlson.'  \n\nGriffin joked about going after Barron in her stand-up act back in December in an interview with Vulture.\n\n'Now more than ever we must absolutely go for all the absurdities,' said Griffin. \n\n'For me, that's Trump and all things Trump. It's not about trying to be an equal-opportunity offender anymore because Hillary got such a beat down. It's his turn.'\n\nShe continued: 'So I'm happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump - and also to Barron. You know a lot of comics are going to go hard for Donald, my edge is that I'll go direct for Barron. I'm going to get in ahead of the game.'\n\nThat comment spurred Don Jr. to comment after Griffin's interview, writing on Twitter: 'To put everything into perspective this is a must read from Dec 16 even states it's ok to go after Barron an 11 y/o.' \n\nMost would take issue with an adult targeting a child for ridicule, but Griffin's lawyer said on Friday that she should not have lost any jobs over this image.\n\nThe only reason she did lose those jobs however explained Bloom, was because of the Trump family. \n\n'As a result of the first family bullying her, she has been vilified, getting death threats, fired from multiple jobs and had multiple events canceled,' said Bloom.\n\nThose death threats are more serious than the loss of work for Griffin, who said: 'This is America, and you shouldn't have to die for it. The death threats I am getting are constant and they are detailed.'\n\nGriffin then made a point of adding: 'Today it's me. Tomorrow it could be you.'\n\nBloom also stressed her client's impeccable record and the fact that she has never committed an act of violence or assault before, stating: 'Kathy never imagined it could be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against Trump. That was never what she intended.'\n\nThe victim's rights lawyer, who also represented a number of former employees who are suing Fox News, also noted of the photo shoot: 'This was clearly a parody of Trump's own sexist remarks, taken to an extreme, edgy visual.'\n\nShe used her introduction to explain why President Trump's actions against Griffin were such a problem.\n\n'Kathy and Donald Trump are not equals. He's the president of the United States. He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, and this isn't just another celebrity feud,' said Bloom.\n\n'He's the president of the United States. His family is calling on Kathy on Twitter to be fired from all of her jobs. This is outrageous and unprecedented.'\n\nGriffin also pointed out what she claimed was another difference between herself and President Trump, saying: 'I go town to town with my dick jokes and try to make people laugh. I didn't grab anyone's you know what.' \n\nGriffin thinks that ultimately she was targeted because of her sex and her level of fame.\n\n'It's quite clear they're trying to use me as a distraction and I'm not going to be collateral damage for this fool,' said Griffin. \n\n'I'm the easiest target. I'm D-list comedian Kathy Griffin.'\n\nAnd while she wanted to stay quiet, she was afraid about others suffering a fate similar to her own she explained on Friday. \n\n'He broke me and then I was like 'No, this isn't right,'' said Griffin. \n\n'I apologized because was the right thing to do. Then it became a mob mentality pile-on.'\n\nGriffin, who said she is '110 pounds when wet,' went on to explain: 'He's not just Donald Trump, real estate developer, having a celebrity feud He's using the power of the government.' \n\nBloom made a similar comment, stating: 'The message was clear: Criticize the president, lose your job.'\n\nShe also noted: 'Ted Nugent threatened to kill President Obama. President Trump invited him to the White House.' \n\nThe lawyer's anger towards President Trump also turned a but personal at one point it seemed, when she shouted out at one reporter: 'There's a lot of disgusting stuff on the news every day, like the fact that [President Trump is] making us the laughing stock of the world.'\n\nAnd it seems that on top of the blows to her professional life there have also been some difficult moments in Griffin's personal life as a result of this incident.\n\nIn a moment that anything but funny on Friday, Griffin was asked to comment on her friend and former CNN co-host Anderson Cooper criticizing her decision to post a criticism of her photo on Twitter.\n\n'That hurt, that's all,' said Griffin, breaking down in tears once more.\n\nCooper wrote on his personal account Tuesday: 'For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.' \n\nShe was fired from her post as his New Year's Eve co-host on CNN roughly 24 hours later. \n\nFrom the tone of her voice on Friday, it also seemed that the two may not have been in contact this week. \n\nGriffin spoke about President Trump at length in an interview this past March with CityBeat Cincinnati, revealing that the two had known one another for two decades.\n\n'I’ve known him off and on since 1995,' said Griffin. \n\n'I feel very privileged to be able to bring my own personal run-ins with \"The Cheeto\" to audiences all over, but most importantly to Cincinnati. The Taft Theatre audience needs to hear from someone who has met him several times'\n\nGriffin admitted in the interview that she never had a particularly high opinion of President Trump.\n\n'I found him to always be a buffoon,' she explained. \n\n'But honestly, and I think unfortunately, a lot of people just thought he was harmless.'\n\nShe then revealed that President Trump would often ask her to not go after him during her stand-up routines.\n\n'Almost every time I’ve run into this fool, he comes up to me and says, \"Uh, oh, don’t be too hard on me. I know you’re going to be funny, but you can be tough,\"' said Griffin.\n\n'I find that fascinating.'\n\nShe also mentioned that one of her best friends, the late Joan Rivers, was also incredibly close to President Trump.\n\n'I think she got a kick out of him, but I don’t think she knew this side of him,' said Griffin. \n\n'I don’t know if anybody knew he was this racist and stupid, because I think you assume that people who have done well in one area or another have a certain acumen or certain talents.'\n\nGriffin was roundly criticized after posting the photo earlier this week, with everyone from former first daughter Chelsea Clinton to her good friend Anderson Cooper publicly stating that the photo and accompanying video was 'appalling' and 'disgusting.'\n\nPresident Trump also spoke out after seeing the photo, as did his son Don Jr., daughter-in-law Lara and the First Lady.   \n\nMeanwhile, the harsh words keep coming for Griffin, with Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey the latest to take aim at the entertainer, saying at a news conference on Thursday: 'She's disgusting. And it's completely outrageous. I don't think anybody should hire her again for anything.'\n\nBloom has also been receiving her fair share of negative notes, with the lawyer Tweeting Friday morning: 'To all you sending me hate mail today for my representation of Kathy Griffin, I have this message for you. XO Lisa'\n\nShe then included an image of an affirmation that read: 'The Devil whispered in my ear, 'You're not strong enough to withstand the storm.'\n\n'Today I whispered in the Devil's ear, 'I am the storm.''\n\nThe four Trumps who denounced Griffin all stressed the fact that there are young children in the family who were traumatized by the image.\n\nDon Jr. was the first to speak out, with the oldest Trump child taking to Twitter soon after the image was posted on Tuesday.\n\nHe posted twelve tweets in the span of 24 hours, with many calling for CNN to fire Griffin.\n\n'Dear @CNN, I must have missed your statement banning your commentator #KathyGriffin from future shows. Please resend. Thx,' wrote Don Jr. in one tweet.\n\nHe also responded to tweets from CNN anchors Jake Taper and Cooper after they reprimanded Griffin on the social media site, asking why she still had not been fired and if they would work with the comedian in the future.\n\nThe men did not engage Don Jr., and on Wednesday it was announced that CNN had terminated Griffin from their annual New Year's Eve show.\n\nDon Jr. also brought up his two oldest children, daughter Kai and son Don III in one tweet, writing: 'And I'm counting down having to explain it to my 8 and 10 year olds who I'm sure will see/hear about it at school.'\n\nThat was the line President Trump took that same day, writing on Twitter:'Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!'\n\nThe most damning statement however came from the First Lady, who has done her best to stay out of the many controversies that have mired her husband's presidency. \n\n'As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,' said Melania just hours after a report emerged claiming that her son Barron initially thought that his father had been decapitated when he saw the image on TV. \n\n'When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.'\n\nLara was the last to speak out, and targeted the photographer Tyler Shields. \n\nThe daughter-in-law of President Trump expressed how appalled she was during an appearance on 'Hannity' Wednesday night, before going on to state that Griffin is not the only person who should be getting heat for the incident.\n\n'She has many people around her. There was a photographer involved.

He wondered what he might have done differently “if I were stronger.” He confessed that he had hustled his adversary off the phone in “kind of a slightly cowardly way” to avoid refusing his demands. He was “worried very much” about being in the mold of his most infamous predecessor, J. Edgar Hoover, by seeming to hold his superior hostage over salacious allegations about his sex life.\n\nBut in more than two hours of steady, soft-spoken Senate testimony, former FBI Director James Comey nevertheless delivered a quietly devastating indictment of President Donald Trump, confiding that he had kept contemporaneous notes of their every conversation for one overriding and unflinching reason: “I was honestly concerned that he might lie.”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nComey’s testimony may or may not go down in the annals of great Washington scandals. His Republican interlocutors on the Senate Intelligence Committee succeeded in eliciting his repeated confirmation that, so far as he knew, Trump has never been personally under FBI investigation for possible collusion with the Russians — or anything else, for that matter. Further, Comey repeatedly conceded that neither Trump’s efforts to get him to confirm that fact publicly, nor the president’s single request to back off investigating the Russia-related activities of the fired national security adviser Michael Flynn, had ever impeded the ongoing inquiry that is now in the hands of special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nBut Comey’s appearance Thursday will certainly rank with the great self-deprecating performances of past witnesses like Lt. Col. Oliver North in the Iran-Contra scandal, or Sen. Sam Ervin, chairman of the Watergate select committee, who liked to insist that he was “just a country lawyer.” In his own telling, Comey was just an ordinary guy doing his job in extraordinary circumstances, a bona fide Eagle Scout who, gosh darn it, is far too modest to say so out loud.\n\n“My mother raised me not to say things like this about myself, so I’m not gonna,” Comey said when Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) asked him whether he wanted to say anything about why people should believe him and not the president. Similarly, Comey said he would have to leave it to others to say whether the president had obstructed justice.\n\nYet the damage was already done. Comey had not finished testifying before the White House deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was moved to insist, “I can definitively say the president is not a liar. I think it's frankly insulting.” Such protestations from any White House are never a good thing. (See Richard Nixon’s, “I am not a crook,” and Bill Clinton’s, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,” just for starters).\n\nIn fact, Comey’s testimony repeatedly and emphatically contradicted Trump’s account of events on multiple points: It was Trump, he said, not himself who asked to have a dinner on Jan. 27 (he had to break a date with his wife to do so), at which the president then demanded Comey’s “loyalty.” Contrary to Trump’s public insistence that he never asked Comey to back off the Flynn investigation, Comey testified that on Valentine’s Day the president cleared the Oval Office of the attorney general and other officials and then did just that.\n\nAt one point, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) told Comey that he found Trump’s request about Flynn — “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go” — to be “a pretty light touch” from someone who might be trying to block an investigation. But neither Lankford nor any of his other Republican colleagues questioned the veracity or specificity of Comey’s essential account — something that the low-key, Joe Friday tenor of the former director’s testimony would have made all the tougher to do in any case.\n\nFor all his insistence that he had been “stunned” by Trump’s request to curtail the Flynn inquiry, Comey made it clear that he had never been too stunned to deploy the tactics of a skilled Washington infighter. When the president tweeted that he might have tapes of the conversations, Comey testified that he awoke in the middle of the night and thought, “Holy cow, there might be tapes.” That impelled him to leak his own memos (which he had deliberately written with unclassified status, so they could be shared easily within the FBI) to the press through a friend, in the explicit hope that they might prompt the appointment of a special prosecutor.\n\n“Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” he told Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) at one point.\n\nAnd in a subtle window into the investigator’s art, Comey suggested that he had refrained from sharing what he considered to be the president’s improper requests with agents working on the Russia case not only to avoid infecting their inquiry, but because he believed the president’s request was “a very disturbing development, really important to our work.” That implies that Comey feared the president’s own words and actions might eventually become the subject of official inquiry — as they presumably now have.\n\nComey’s humble demeanor did not keep him from defending his honor, as he hotly did at the outset of his testimony, when he confessed to confusion and ultimately outrage at the Trump administration’s shifting explanations for his firing. “Although the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director,” he said, “the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple.”\n\nBut for the most part, Comey portrayed himself less as a threatening Torquemada than as a shocked straight arrow, struggling to cope with a president whose behavior and demeanor had unnerved and confounded him from their first meeting.\n\nWhen Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) asked Comey to confirm that he had told Trump at their first meeting on Jan. 6 at Trump Tower that he was not the subject of any “counterintelligence investigation” into Russian meddling, Comey took some pains to say that the context was more specific. He had just briefed Trump on the contents of an unverified dossier alleging that the Russians had compromising evidence about Trump’s personal behavior.\n\n“I was briefing him about salacious and unverified material,” Comey said. “It was in a context of that that he had a strong and defensive reaction about that not being true. My reading of it was it was important for me to assure him we were not personally investigating him.” He added, “It was very important because it was, first, true, and second, I was worried very much of being in kind of a — kind of J. Edgar Hoover-type situation. I didn't want him thinking I was briefing him on this to sort of hang it over him in some way.\n\nHoover, who ran the FBI for just shy of 48 years, was well known for keeping secret files that he used to intimidate a range of politicians and public figures.\n\nAt another point, Feinstein wanted to know why Comey had not rejected Trump’s request about Flynn out of hand.\n\n“Now, here’s the question,” she said. “You’re big, you’re strong. I know the Oval Office and I know what happens to people when they walk in. There is a certain amount of intimidation. But why didn’t you stop and say, ‘Mr. President, this is wrong. I cannot discuss this with you.”\n\n“It’s a great question,” Comey replied. “Maybe if I were stronger, I would have. I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took it in.”\n\nWhen Feinstein asked Comey why he had told Trump in a March 30 phone conversation that he would see what he could do about getting the word out that Trump was not personally under investigation, Comey again suggested his response had been nothing to brag about.\n\n“It was kind of a cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we're not going to do that,” he said. “That I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly, and then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general.”\n\nComey made it clear that he was still smarting from the firestorm of criticism that greeted his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server last year, acknowledging that “it caused a whole lot of personal pain for me.” But he insisted that, even knowing all he knows now, he would not have handled the matter differently. He acknowledged that Clinton herself might have fired him if she had won.\n\nIn an answer to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), about whether Trump had ever expressed serious concern about the underlying issue at hand — the deliberate Russian interference in last year’s election — Comey turned passionate, displaying more emotion than in any other response.\n\n“The reason this is such a big deal,” he said. “We have this big messy wonderful country where we fight with each other all the time. But nobody tells us what to think, what to fight about, what to vote for except other Americans. And that's wonderful and often painful. But we're talking about a foreign government that using technical intrusion, lots of other methods tried to shape the way we think, we vote, we act. That is a big deal. And people need to recognize it. It's not about Republicans or Democrats. They're coming after America, which I hope we all love equally.”\n\nFor at least a fleeting moment, that seemed to be a statement on which all members of the committee might agree."],[5,"Trump rejects Comey's testimony: 'No collusion.

If that’s the consequence, that’s extremely dangerous.”\n\nThe academic has previously claimed the Republicans are “overwhelmingly” committed to destroying human life on earth.\n\nAsked about the consequences of Donald Trump’s presidency, Mr Chomsky replied: “The main damage he’ll do is to the world, and it’s already happening.\n\n\"The most significant aspect of the Trump election – and it’s not just Trump, it’s the whole Republican Party – is their departing from the rest of the world on climate change.\n\n“It’s a crucial issue.

The working class is just not their constituency. \n\n“The Republicans claim to be but they’re basically their class enemy. However, they can appeal to people on the basis of non-economic claims about religion, white supremacy…identity politics.\n\n“White supremacy is very deeply rooted in the United States… it ranks higher than even South Africa.

But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.\n\nIn any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal, there would be no backlash.\n\nWhat was not thought through, apparently, was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe.\n\n\"We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),\" Rosenstein said. \"The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.\"\n\nComey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being \"extremely careless\" with sensitive information.\n\nJust days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had reopened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges."],[5,"‘This Bloodshed Must End’","“This bloodshed must end.

Perelman and quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\n“He’s a good guy to have as my golf partner,” Trump said about Manning, who was spotted at the White House after returning in the presidential motorcade from Trump’s golf course in Virginia."],[5,"Why Is Trump Causing Chaos In Washington But Not In The Stock Market?","On Jan. 25, 2017, newly inaugurated President Trump repeated his baseless claim that millions of undocumented immigrants illegally voted in November’s election. He signed an executive order directing construction of his signature border wall. And a House committee announced it would start investigating possible Russian interference in the election.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit an all-time high.\n\nOn Feb. 9, an appeals court refused to reinstate Trump’s controversial travel ban. Presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway came under fire for urging Americans to buy Ivanka Trump’s products. And multiple newspapers reported that then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had discussed sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. before Trump took office.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit an all-time high.\n\nOn May 17, The New York Times reported that fired FBI Director James Comey had written a memo documenting Trump’s alleged efforts to slow the Russia investigation. This time, markets plummeted, and observers began to ask whether investors were waking up to the risk posed by Trump.\n\nOne week later, the S&P 500 hit an all-time high.\n\nInvestors’ apparent indifference to the tumultuous start to Trump’s presidency has left some experts shaking their heads. After all, we are constantly told that markets hate uncertainty. And Trump’s first months in office have brought plenty of uncertainty: He hasn’t released specific proposals for much of his domestic agenda; he has appeared to question core elements of American foreign policy, including the U.S. commitment to NATO; and the ongoing Russia investigation has led even some Republican members of Congress to discuss the possibility of impeachment.\n\n“Washington and Wall Street cannot both be right,” Financial Times columnist Edward Luce wrote last week. “Washington and the world are in a state of fear. On the other, Wall Street sees only blue skies ahead.”\n\nSo why aren’t investors more fearful? It’s hard to know for sure — interpreting market behavior is usually a sucker’s game. But it’s possible to lay out a few, not mutually exclusive, theories:\n\nWhen the market soared right after Election Day, many analysts attributed it to a “Trump bump”: Investors were buying stocks in anticipation of tax cuts, deregulation and other policies that would help corporate bottom lines. So with much of Trump’s agenda now stalled — tax reform, in particular, now seems likely to wait until next year — it would be logical to expect the rally to fade.\n\nBut maybe the reason the Trump bump hasn’t disappeared is that it never existed in the first place. It’s probably true that the immediate post-election rally was connected to the vote; the S&P 500 jumped 3 percent in the two weeks after Election Day. But it isn’t clear whether investors were applauding Trump’s win or, for example, were relieved that the vote had yielded a clear outcome. (Recall that there had been concerns that Trump might challenge the election result had he lost.) And beyond the first couple weeks, there isn’t much evidence of a Trump effect at all. Stocks have continued rising in 2017, but at more or less the rate they rose in early 2016.\n\nIt’s possible, of course, that stocks would have fared worse if Trump hadn’t become president. It’s also possible they would have done better. (It’s worth noting that before the election, many experts predicted a Trump win would be bad for markets, a claim that always seemed dubious.) But absent compelling evidence in either direction, the safest assumption is probably that the election didn’t have a strong effect in either direction. Presidents, after all, have relatively little control over the near-term direction of the economy. And there are other factors that could explain the recent rally. The U.S. economy has continued to improve, for example; the Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced its latest interest-rate hike, a vote of confidence in the recovery. The rest of the world is looking healthier, too, an increasingly important factor for stocks as U.S. companies sell more products overseas. Sara Johnson, senior research director at IHS Markit, an economic analysis firm, noted that the strongest market gains over the past year have come in emerging markets, not in the U.S., a sign that Trump’s role in the rally is at least limited.\n\n“It’s not surprising to see some strength this year,” Johnson said. “Globally we’re in an environment of more risk-taking … and that tends to be an environment in which stock markets gain.”\n\nEven if the market rally is due, at least in part, to investors’ hopes for Trump’s term, it isn’t clear that his early-term struggles should necessarily dampen their enthusiasm. The Russia investigation has probably weakened Trump’s already limited ability to push his policies through Congress, but that doesn’t mean nothing will get done. Republicans, after all, still control the House and Senate. And despite various delays and setbacks, core parts of their agenda are moving ahead. They have already rolled back dozens of Obama-era regulations. The fate of the Republican health care overhaul is far from certain, but a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act (including the elimination of the employer mandate and the rollback of its tax surcharges) seems likely. (And even if Congress doesn’t pass a bill, the administration has already begun working to roll back some of its provisions.) Broader tax reform has been slow to get off the ground, but most experts still expect an eventual deal that results in lower business taxes.\n\nNot coincidentally, those are all areas where Trump and congressional Republicans are largely in agreement. And they also happen to be among the most popular policies among investors and business leaders. On the other hand, many business leaders were less keen on other elements of Trump’s agenda such as unwinding trade deals and limiting immigration — policies that also enjoy less broad support among congressional Republicans.\n\nTrump’s early-term struggles, then, could pose less of a challenge to his business-friendly tax and regulatory policies than to his more populist policies. In fact, to the extent that power shifts from the White House to Congress — and it is too soon to say that is happening — that could be good news for investors.\n\n“You get a Romney-Bush, centrist Republican package,” said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist for TS Lombard, an investment firm. “But what you don’t get it is the populist package that he ran on.”\n\nSo far, we’ve been working on the assumption that investors are basically correct in their assessment of the situation: Sure, Washington is a mess, but that doesn’t really matter; or sure, Washington is a mess, but Republicans will still manage to cut taxes. But there’s another possibility: Wall Street is wrong.\n\nInvestors could be misreading the situation in big ways or small ways. It’s possible, for example, that investors, on average, expect Republicans to pass a tax cut package early next year. But maybe it takes Congress longer, or maybe Republicans never get their act together at all. That would probably be bad for stocks, but in a subtle way. Investors would gradually realize that tax reform was in trouble, and they would start pricing that into their decisions. Given all the other variables that are constantly affecting stock prices, we might not even be able to discern the effect.\n\nBut it’s also possible investors are failing to account for something major. Maybe Trump really will start a trade war with China, sparking a global recession. Maybe Trump will start a war war, in Syria or North Korea. Or maybe his inexperience with international affairs will lead him to make some other kind of blunder — setting off a crisis in the Middle East, for example.\n\nThen there is the debt ceiling. The Treasury Department has said that if Congress doesn’t vote to raise the federal borrowing limit by sometime in early September, the government will be unable to pay its bills — a potentially catastrophic event that could set off a global financial crisis and do lasting damage to the U.S.’s ability to borrow money. Debt limit votes used to be routine, but in recent years, conservative members of Congress repeatedly used the process to gain leverage in their negotiations with the Obama administration. That kind of brinksmanship seems less likely with Trump in office, but not impossible — at times, members of Trump’s own administration have seemed to disagree on the issue. “It would be self-defeating not to [raise the limit], but stranger things have happened,” Johnson said.\n\nMarkets are notoriously bad at assessing this kind of “tail risk” — events that are unlikely to occur but that matter a lot when they do. Just think of the 2008 financial crisis, when markets failed to foresee how the collapse of the mortgage market could destabilize the entire financial system. Investors, in other words, might be right to shrug off the endless headlines about Trump’s dysfunctional White House; it’s the risks that markets aren’t accounting for that could pose the real threat."],[5,"Does Robert Mueller Want to Cause a Civil War?","How are we supposed to take the myriad leaks coming from Robert Mueller's special investigation of what I guess we could call \"The Russian Matter\"?\n\nYou would think that on the day Rep.

They think they know what's best for us hoi polloi, so they are allowed to break the law with impunity when the rest of us poor schmucks have to toe the line on a parking ticket. Over such things are civil wars and revolutions fought (taxation without representation, etc.) -- with justification.\n\nThat is a big story, bigger even than Trump/Russia (well, that wouldn't be hard).  Whether or not Trump obstructed justice we have no way of knowing (though Alan Dershowitz and Jonathan Turley are skeptical), but we do know that illegal leakers are all over our government from intelligence agencies to the FBI.  This is quite simply totalitarianism on the march, the subversion of the rule of law in a democratic republic.\n\nWhat we are witnessing is a cross between \"Animal Farm\" and Ugo Betti's \"Corruption in the Palace of Justice\" as produced by Jeff Bezos. It also resembles the techniques employed during Stalin's show trials when \"information\" was leaked to the reliable press to assure the discrediting of defendants in advance of their testimony.  Considering what we have seen in recent days, I have no doubt that some of these leakers would love to see both Trump and Kushner sent to the Gulag, if only we had one."],[5,"At Least Three DC Bars Will Open Early for Comey's Testimony","Twitter groaned Monday when journalist Marin Cogan tweeted outher discovery that Shaw’s Tavern, a bar and restaurant on Florida Ave., Northwest, would be opening early this Thursday so it could screen former FBI Director James Comey‘s appearance before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The responses in the first few minutes ranged from nerdy endorsement to burn-“This Town”-down cynicism.\n\nBut Shaw’s Tavern’s nod to DC’s eternal nerdiness is no one-off. At least two other bars plan to open their doors early Thursday for people who want to pound an IPA at 10:30 AM while crafting pithy tweets about congressional testimony they could just as easily monitor in a browser tab. Duffy’s, a pub off U Street known more for its wings and gatherings of Green Bay Packers fans, is also getting in on the action, showing the hearing on the 15 screens arrayed across its dining room and patio. There will even be a special “covfefe” cocktail, a nod to a week-old presidential typo.\n\nThe Partisan, in Penn Quarter, will open at 10 AM and flip its two televisions to the hearing while it serves breakfast sandwiches from the adjoining Red Apron Butchery and its own cocktail specials (neither of which are named after “covfefe”).\n\nTo be fair, this is a long-awaited hearing that will mark Comey’s first public statements since he was tossed by President Trump, reportedly because Comey refused to drop the bureaus’s ongoing investigation into the Russian government’s meddling in last year’s election. But for a bar to open up and flip on CNN or MSNBC or one of the broadcast networks and show a congressional hearing? Could DC parody itself anymore? Washington is reliably dorky enough that there are always bar specials organized around presidential debates and elections. But those are global events with four years of build-up (and drinking games!), not a midday Senate hearing full of legislative minutiae and wonky talk.\n\nBut restaurant specials built around the Comey hearing seem like a result of more than just a general sense of wonkiness. DC’s Trump-induced apoplexy could be playing a role, too. In a city where only 4 percent of voters actually wanted this guy, cashing in on the other 96 percent’s enduring anger is a safe bet. And why not? DC’s loathing for Trump is so palpable, any moment that presents a chance to thrash his dysfunctional presidency even more feels like cause for Washingtonians to pausing their workdays and anticipate the killing stroke that’ll take his administration down.\n\nExcept it doesn’t work like that. Investigations into shady presidential activities can take years. The special investigation led by former FBI Director (andComey BFF) Robert Mueller is still gearing up. And a quintessential lawman like Comey might be more likely to demur to the investigative process than offer a smoking gun when he’s questioned by senators on Thursday.\n\nSo whether you watch at work or sneak off to the bar on Thursday, watch Comey with frustration toward Trump but caution that this is just one more station on a long slog that may or may not yield your desired result. But if you’re drinking, please be advised not to build a drinking game around every time Comey says he cannot comment on an ongoing investigation, or you’ll be passed out on the floor by 10:30."],[5,"Elon Musk to Trump: Ditch Paris deal and I'll quit as your adviser","The CEO of both Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX tweeted Wednesday that he's done everything possible to lobby the president to keep the U.S. in the treaty.\n\n\"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain,\" Musk said.\n\nAsked via Twitter what he'll do if Trump decides to leave, Musk responded that he would \"have no choice but to depart [the] councils in that case.\"\n\nMusk is currently one of 18 business leaders who serve on Trump's business advisory council, formally known as the Strategic and Policy Forum. He is also part of the president's manufacturing jobs initiative, and has met with POTUS to discuss the need to boost infrastructure spending.\n\nTrump is expected to announce later this week that he intends to pull out of the landmark Paris agreement. The U.S. signed the accord in 2015, committing to reducing carbon emissions by 26% to 28% within a decade.\n\nTesla is one of hundreds of companies that has asked Trump not to withdraw.\n\nMusk has said he's raised climate issues with the White House before, but that despite these efforts, he's come under fire for his willingness to engage with the Trump administration. In April, a Silicon Valley investor took out full-page ads in the Sunday editions of the Washington Post and New York Times that called on Musk to \"dump Trump.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Musk has publicly opposed the Trump administration. Musk came out strongly against the president's executive order on immigration, which temporarily banned travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. Musk said in February that he would remain on Trump's advisory councils even though he publicly opposed the ban.\n\n\"Advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration,\" Musk said on Twitter at the time.\n\nUber CEO Travis Kalanick, meanwhile, decided to step down to protest the ban.\n\nSilicon Valley has had a complicated relationship with the Trump White House in its early months. Tech giants like Tesla, Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) have had to balance their desire to try to influence policy with their longstanding support for immigration and green energy."],[5,"Calling Earth a “Loser,” Trump Vows to Make Better Deal with New Planet","WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In a dramatic announcement from the White House Rose Garden on Thursday, Donald J. Trump pronounced the planet Earth a “loser” and vowed to make a better deal with a new planet.\n\n“Earth is a terrible, very bad planet,” he told the White House press corps. “It’s maybe the worst planet in the solar system, and it’s far from the biggest.”\n\nTrump blasted former President Barack Obama for signing deals that committed the United States to remain on the planet Earth indefinitely. “Obama is almost as big a loser as Earth,” Trump said. “If Obama was a planet, guess what planet he’d be? That’s right: Earth.”\n\nWhen asked which planet he would make a new deal with, Trump offered few specifics, saying only, “The solar system has millions of terrific planets, and they’re all better than Earth, which is a sick, failing loser.”\n\nTrump’s remarks drew a strong response from one of the United States’ NATO allies, Germany’s Angela Merkel. “I strongly support Donald Trump leaving the planet Earth,” she said."],[5,"Why Trumponomics won’t make America great again","DONALD TRUMP rules over Washington as if he were a king and the White House his court. His displays of dominance, his need to be the centre of attention and his impetuousness have a whiff of Henry VIII about them. Fortified by his belief that his extraordinary route to power is proof of the collective mediocrity of Congress, the bureaucracy and the media, he attacks any person and any idea standing in his way.\n\nJust how much trouble that can cause was on sensational display this week, with his sacking of James Comey—only the second director of the FBI to have been kicked out. Mr Comey has made mistakes and Mr Trump was within his rights. But the president has succeeded only in drawing attention to questions about his links to Russia and his contempt for the norms designed to hold would-be kings in check.\n\nJust as dangerous, and no less important to ordinary Americans, however, is Mr Trump’s plan for the economy. It treats orthodoxy, accuracy and consistency as if they were simply to be negotiated away in a series of earth-shattering deals. Although Trumponomics could stoke a mini-boom, it, too, poses dangers to America and the world.\n\nTrumponomics 101\n\nIn an interview with this newspaper, the president gave his most extensive description yet of what he wants for the economy (see article). His target is to ensure that more Americans have well-paid jobs by raising the growth rate. His advisers talk of 3% GDP growth—a full percentage point higher than what most economists believe is today’s sustainable pace.\n\nIn Mr Trump’s mind the most important path to better jobs and faster growth is through fairer trade deals. Though he claims he is a free-trader, provided the rules are fair, his outlook is squarely that of an economic nationalist. Trade is fair when trade flows are balanced. Firms should be rewarded for investing at home and punished for investing abroad.\n\nThe second and third strands of Trumponomics, tax cuts and deregulation, will encourage that domestic investment. Lower taxes and fewer rules will fire up entrepreneurs, leading to faster growth and better jobs. This is standard supply-side economics, but to see Trumponomics as a rehash of Republican orthodoxy is a mistake—and not only because its economic nationalism is a departure for a party that has championed free trade.\n\nThe real difference is that Trumponomics (unlike, say, Reaganomics) is not an economic doctrine at all. It is best seen as a set of proposals put together by businessmen courtiers for their king. Mr Trump has listened to scores of executives, but there are barely any economists in the White House. His approach to the economy is born of a mindset where deals have winners and losers and where canny negotiators confound abstract principles. Call it boardroom capitalism.\n\nThat Trumponomics is a business wishlist helps explain why critics on the left have laid into its poor distributional consequences, fiscal indiscipline and potential cronyism. And it makes clear why businessmen and investors have been enthusiastic, seeing it as a shot in the arm for those who take risks and seek profits. Stockmarkets are close to record highs and indices of business confidence have soared.\n\nIn the short term that confidence could prove self-fulfilling. America can bully Canada and Mexico into renegotiating NAFTA. For all their sermons about fiscal prudence, Republicans in Congress are unlikely to deny Mr Trump a tax cut. Stimulus and rule-slashing may lead to faster growth. And with inflation still quiescent, the Federal Reserve might not choke that growth with sharply higher interest rates.\n\nUnleashing pent-up energy would be welcome, but Mr Trump’s agenda comes with two dangers. The economic assumptions implicit in it are internally inconsistent. And they are based on a picture of America’s economy that is decades out of date.\n\nContrary to the Trump team’s assertions, there is little evidence that either the global trading system or individual trade deals have been systematically biased against America (see article). Instead, America’s trade deficit—Mr Trump’s main gauge of the unfairness of trade deals—is better understood as the gap between how much Americans save and how much they invest (see article). The fine print of trade deals is all but irrelevant. Textbooks predict that Mr Trump’s plans to boost domestic investment will probably lead to larger trade deficits, as it did in the Reagan boom of the 1980s. If so, Mr Trump will either need to abandon his measure of fair trade or, more damagingly, try to curb deficits by using protectionist tariffs that will hurt growth and sow mistrust around the world.\n\nA deeper problem is that Trumponomics draws on a blinkered view of America’s economy. Mr Trump and his advisers are obsessed with the effect of trade on manufacturing jobs, even though manufacturing employs only 8.5% of America’s workers and accounts for only 12% of GDP. Service industries barely seem to register. This blinds Trumponomics to today’s biggest economic worry: the turbulence being created by new technologies. Yet technology, not trade, is ravaging American retailing, an industry that employs more people than manufacturing (see article). And economic nationalism will speed automation: firms unable to outsource jobs to Mexico will stay competitive by investing in machines at home. Productivity and profits may rise, but this may not help the less-skilled factory workers who Mr Trump claims are his priority.\n\nThe bite behind the bark\n\nTrumponomics is a poor recipe for long-term prosperity. America will end up more indebted and more unequal. It will neglect the real issues, such as how to retrain hardworking people whose skills are becoming redundant. Worse, when the contradictions become apparent, Mr Trump’s economic nationalism may become fiercer, leading to backlashes in other countries—further stoking anger in America. Even if it produces a short-lived burst of growth, Trumponomics offers no lasting remedy for America’s economic ills. It may yet pave the way for something worse.\n\nA complete transcript of The Economist’s interview with Mr Trump is available here"],[5,"Rush Limbaugh says James Comey was a part of the ‘deep state’ against Trump – TheBlaze","Right-wing talk show host Rush Limbaugh said that former FBI Director was a member of the “deep state,” a name for a shadowy group of government employees who are secretly organizing to undermine President Trump and oppose his agenda. Limbaugh explained why he made this conclusion on his show Friday.\n\n“I am coming around to believe that James Comey has been part of an ongoing effort to entrap President Trump for the express purposes of having him legally charged with whatever offenses they could drum up,” he said.\n\n“I believe that Comey is just one of the many agents in the Washington establishment who have devoted themselves to tricknology, deceit,and all out warfare in an effort to entrap or ensnare Trump or in other ways to flat out just destroy Trump,” he added.\n\n“And the fact that it isn’t working, because one thing’s for sure – after yesterday, nothing changes,” he concluded. “The people that hate Trump are still there and the people that love Trump are still there.”\n\n“And the people that love Trump are becoming more hated,” he added.\n\n“They cover up the fact that Trump is not a target,” he said elsewhere during his show,“and they get away with five months of making it look like he is. ‘He’s a bad actor! He doesn’t deserve the presidency! He’s an illegitimate, immoral pig.’ They’ve had a clear field. They’ve had collusion. They’ve had conspiratorial help with the media and any other agents they wanted to bring into this — the CIA, the embeds in the deep state.”\n\n“They’ve had an army,” he continued, “and they’ve had hearing after hearing where “bombshells” were supposed to drop that would destroy Trump — Sally Yates, Comey a couple times — and Trump’s still standing.”\n\nComey’s highly anticipated testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday was called a “complete vindication” by President Trump and his many supporters, including Rush Limbaugh. Detractors, on the other hand, have pointed to Comey’s characterization of their private meetings as evidence that Trump was trying to improperly influence the investigations by the FBI. Even MSNBC’s Chris Matthews admitted that the Russian collusion story appeared to be collapsing."],[5,"It’s Mayhem, Fear, and Disarray in Trump’s White House","It has been a testing week for Team Trump. As the Washington Post reported on Monday, only one day after he abruptly sacked F.B.I. director James Comey, the president of the United States shared highly classified information at the White House with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. “I get great intel,” Donald Trump reportedly bragged, before forging ahead and imparting said intel, which was obtained through an intelligence sharing partner, who had not given the United States permission to share this information.\n\nOnce again, Trump’s ragtag team of underlings was required to clean up the mess, which was exacerbated by the fact that their boss ascended to the presidency, in part, by turning Hillary Clinton’s temple-scratching e-mail scandal into a Category 5 political event. (“FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem” he tweeted on July 15.) Bewildered by the bizarre events of the week, and fielding the colossal fallout, occupants of the White House are apparently locked into a fraught state of panic, which was likely exacerbated by recent reports regarding the prospect of an imminent staff reshuffle, which suggest that some combination of Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon and Sean Spicer could face the firing line. Thus far, their strategy has coalesced around the method of blunt denial. Shortly after the story broke, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, and Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell started their spin, issuing a triple statement. “This story is false,” read out Powell, flatly.\n\nIt didn't quite end there, though. McMaster then went on to brief reporters, again, declaring The Post's report to be “false,” and denying Trump had exposed methods and sources. “At no time, at no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed and the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known.” He took no questions, perhaps to avoid the point that the report had not suggested Trump had discussed either methods or sources, but alleged he put a source at risk by sharing information.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders took to the press room at 7:35 P.M., informing reporters there would be no more statements coming from the White House that evening. “Tonight we are not doing any other question and answering at this moment,” she told the assembled gaggle.\n\nIf their stance ostensibly appeared united, those present sensed an acute friction, with the Daily Beast reporting that Bannon, Spicer, Sanders, and communications director Mike Dubke entered a conference room and, shortly afterwards, drowned out the sounds of their yelling by amping up the volume on the TV. Speaking to the Beast, one aide described the strain sweeping the White House Monday by likening it to “a morgue.” Senior staffers, secreting themselves away, were said to be “hiding in offices.”\n\nAs expected, external attacks on the latest development are rife. In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: “Revealing classified information at this level is extremely dangerous and puts at risk the lives of Americans and those who gather intelligence for our country.” David Kochel, Jeb Bush's strategist in the 2016 campaign tweeted: “John McCain probably revealed less to the KGB in 5+ years torture at the Hanoi Hilton than Trump did in 5 minutes in the Oval.” Even Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, an ardent defender of Trump’s administration, has demanded comment. His spokesman said: “The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.” The Republican head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker weighed in, and said the story was “very, very troubling” if true. “Obviously they're in a downward spiral right now and they've got to figure out a way to come to grips” with it, he told Bloomberg.\n\nBut, significantly, resentment is now reportedly stirring within the inner circle of Trump’s own team, who are largely inoculated to the capricious president’s whimsical style of governance. The constant stream of scandal and slip-ups is distracting, diverting public and political attention away from their overarching task of effectively governing. “It never stops” one exasperated White House official told Politico. “Basically chaos at all times.” Another advisor, also speaking to Politico, confirmed that the Oval office meeting was probably just as freewheeling as reported, imagining that the information would have been heedlessly broadcast by the unpracticed president. “He doesn't think in those terms.” This person continued: “He doesn't realize the implications of what he's saying. I don't think it was his intentions in any way to share any classified information. He wouldn't want to do that.”\n\nAs the White House continues to be hit by a volley of scandals, fired sporadically from within its walls, its occupants are operating in a structure that steadily erodes stability and plays upon sensationalism. The threat of a reshuffle is a smart way to keep growing dissent in check, but, with Republican officials apparently barring themselves within their own offices, it’s unclear how much longer Trump can continue to maintain support in the ranks of his own party, and perhaps even his own administration."],[5,"Has Donald Trump just fast tracked the start of the next era of climate action?","The US president has just forced climate action up the global political agenda - expect a new wave of investments and bold policy moves to follow\n\nThe reaction to Donald Trump's indefensible decision to exit the Paris Agreement is the most heartening development in climate politics since the Paris agreement was signed. The decision itself remains a contemptible abrogation of duty by a man who seems certain to be remembered as little more than a tragic piece of performance art designed to demonstrate how craven media apologists are capable of being - assuming, that is, he is not remembered by a few cave dwelling survivors as the man who triggered nuclear annihilation. The word soup attempt at an explanation for why the world's largest superpower regards adhering to voluntary goals it could change at any time as unfair defied both logic, truth, and decency. The American novelist Dave Eggers' peerless description of the President as a man who \"cannot spell and does not read\" has never felt more apt.\n\nBut the reaction was something else entirely. I have been racking my brain and cannot think of another example where a sitting president has sparked such sustained and wide-ranging criticism from the business community and supposed allies. Business leaders may have strong opinions on matters of war and peace, but they tend to keep their counsel for obvious reasons. They have historically been a bit slow in commenting on issues of civil rights. They will often comment on policy decisions impacting their businesses, but it is rare for them not to hedge their criticism slightly, to acknowledge the tough decisions politicians have to make and seek the upsides in any policy.\n\nIn contrast, the reaction to Trump's Paris strop from individual businesses and groups representing thousands of firms and investors has been unequivocally damning. His critics even stuck to words the President could understand. Apple CEO Tim Cook called the decision \"wrong\". Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg called it \"bad\". Tesla's Elon Musk and Disney's Robert Iger quit the President's advisory councils in disgust. Michael Bloomberg took trolling to a beautiful new level by offering to cover the cost to the UNFCCC of the US quitting the group. And Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, used a format Trump is familiar with to tweet: \"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the US's leadership position in the world\". Although, to really catch the President's attention he should probably have included some indecipherable typos.\n\nThose rallying to defend the President's decision have come exclusively from the same lobby groups, fossil fuel interests, and right wing hacks that provided much of the deeply flawed economic analysis the White House used to justify its decision. But even here the modest ranks of the President's allies are notable for the absence of many of the oil majors who publicly declared that they support both the Paris Agreement and the US's continued commitment to decarbonisation.\n\nIt is no coincidence that Trump's approval ratings are at record lows. Not only do many businesses disagree with his approach to climate change and the environment, the fact his brand is now so toxic makes speaking out a more sensible approach than keeping their frustrations private. His reprehensible and insulting response to the latest terror attack in the UK will only encourage more business leaders to recognise there is immense reputational damage to be done from being associated too closely with this administration.\n\nI must admit I was prepared to be more than a little cynical at the inevitable positive spin green groups would try to put on Trump's quitting the historical deal. I understand the argument that technology and changing markets mean Trump cannot derail the low carbon transition; these arguments are completely justified - clean technologies will continue to prosper. But, as President Obama used to say, there is such a thing as being too late on climate change. Trump does have the potential to slow the pace of decarbonisation and hamper the emergence of new clean technologies. We cannot have it both ways. The Paris Agreement cannot be both a significant breakthrough one minute and immune to the withdrawal of the world's largest economy the next.\n\nHowever, the reaction to Trump's speech suggests that while the US leaving the agreement is a blow it can be more than offset by the kick-start it will give to other countries and businesses decarbonisation efforts.\n\nYou would expect the former UN climate change chief Christiana Figueres to put a positive spin on Trump's decision, but her assessment already feels prophetic:\n\nThe crucial aspect of the wave of outrage Trump sparked last week is to be found not in the criticism itself, but in the willingness of political and business leaders to crank up pressure on themselves to now deliver on the decarbonisation goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nTake France's Emmanuel Macron as the prime example. In his goading of the US president he has made action on climate change more central to his political credibility than any world leader in history - he now has no choice but to deliver meaningful action. Similarly, Angela Merkel knows her emerging position as the new leader of the free world depends on her ability to accelerate climate action. China and India have invested considerable political capital in challenging the Trump administration's assertion that they are free-riders who are failing to take steps to cut their carbon emissions - with a multi-trillion dollar global clean tech market as the eventual prize they are only going to double down on their green efforts.\n\nTrump has even ensured climate change secured a sizeable walk on role in a UK election for the first time ever, even if the government's transparent attempt to secure a post-Brexit US trade deal meant it was reluctant to join the chorus of disapproval. Whoever wins the election will have to deliver on the UK's Paris Agreement goals and the growing antipathy of the British public towards Trump will only marry with the immense popularity of clean technologies to intensify pressure on Ministers to act.\n\nThe businesses and US states that have condemned Trump's decision now face a similar challenge. The environmental and long-term economic cost of failing to tackle escalating climate risks has always been obvious, but increasingly we are starting to see the political costs become more apparent. If you call out the US president for a wrong-headed decision you had better make sure you then prove why it is so wrong.\n\nThe one part of Trump's critique of the Paris Agreement that held water was the assertion that it was inadequate, that it would not solve the crisis of climate change. Of course, it was always a straw man argument to use this as a reason to exit the deal, because everyone knew it would need to be strengthened over time. The process of strengthening it was meant to start from 2020 onwards, but Trump's attempt at diplomatic vandalism has only fast tracked the next phase of climate action.\n\nExpect Macron, Merkel, Modi, Xi, and perhaps even the next British Prime Minister to come forward with more ambitious emissions reduction plans and low carbon investment rounds in short order. Expect the debate on carbon border tariffs to reignite and efforts to expand carbon markets to accelerate. Expect corporate investment in clean tech R&D and renewables deployment to continue to accelerate. Expect much bolder policies and targets, more 100 per cent renewables pledges, more conventional car bans, more full blown divestment. Expect US states to call the GOP's bluff and demand an alternative plan for tackling emissions as a matter of urgency. The one downside of global consensus is that it always risks becoming too cosy - Trump has shattered that consensus, and in so doing has fired the starting pistol on a new race to prove who can get furthest away from his scientifically illiterate, high risk world view in the shortest space of time.\n\nTrump's unpopularity may even provide the GOP with the break from the climate scepticism that more thoughtful US conservatives have been seeking for years. The backlash against the most woeful President in history is building like a force 10 hurricane looming towards a Florida golf course - those who have hitched their deeply flawed economic and environmental ideology to Trump's nationalist wagon could soon find their new friend is hardly a reliable ally.\n\nFigueres is right, perhaps we should thank the US President; assuming of course his next step isn't getting in to a shooting war with a nuclear power over proposed carbon tariffs, which sadly feels like the kind of possibility we can no longer completely rule out."],[5,"American Gods on television couldn’t be more timely","It’s a good bet that writers are scrambling to produce the first great novel of the Age of Trump: trying to make sense of this monstrous unexpectedness, this terrifying combination of clowntime and apocalypse. But maybe the great novel of Trump’s America has already been written. It came out 16 years ago and its name is American Gods, which makes the new TV adaptation, co-helmed by Bryan Fuller, extremely timely.\n\nIt’s not, I should add, that Neil Gaiman makes any specific prophecy in his novel. American Gods is not actually about Trump. It has no interest in US electoral politics (although it is profoundly interested in power); it has nothing to say about TV reality stars, but it is insightful about TV itself.\n\nShadow Moon, the book’s improbably named hero, is released from jail to attend his wife’s funeral. He runs into, and ends up working for, the enigmatic Mr Wednesday: one of the novel’s titular gods, whose identity will not, if you know the etymology of that particular day of the week, come as a surprise.\n\nWe learn that mortal America coexists with whole populations of deities, some brought over by settlers from the old world – Odin, Thor, Loki, Anansi and so on – and some newly minted out of the particularities of modern life: television, the internet, the stock market, the shadowy power of what nowadays we would call “the deep state”: gods with names such as Media, The Technical Boy and The Intangibles. People believe in these things, and that makes them powerful. “People believe,” Shadow realises. “It’s what people do. They believe. And then they will not take responsibility for their beliefs.”\n\nOne of Gaiman’s nicer ironies is the way the main thing we associate with gods – immortality – is at odds with how temporary specific religions have proved in human history. You don’t worship Zeus, after all, and you’ve never even heard of Tarhunz – though in their day they commanded human devotion on a vast scale. “One day every soldier in the empire has to shower in the blood of your sacrificial bull,” Gaiman’s Jacquel, his version of Anubis, notes sardonically: “The next day they don’t even remember your birthday.” If gods are artefacts of human belief, that leaves them at the mercy of human caprice. And we humans are very capricious.\n\nWhat has all this to do with Trump? Well, American Gods is much more about America than it is about gods. “This is the only country in the world,” Wednesday tells Shadow, “that worries about what it is. The rest of them know what they are. No one ever needs to go searching for the heart of Norway, or looks for the soul of Mozambique. They know what they are.” And Gaiman’s anatomy of America puts this un-anchored itinerant search for belief at its heart.\n\nIn the 2016 election Americans had the choice between one candidate who was rational, experienced and competent and another who was, let’s say, none of those things. We know which they chose. Gaiman’s novel can help us understand why.\n\nTrump is no Odin. He’s not even Gaiman’s deviously clever and far-seeing Mr Wednesday. But Trump is a manifestation of something important: something not rational, a gut-level idiosyncrasy close to caprice. Trump’s genius was understanding that people no more choose leaders for rational reasons than they choose to worship gods for rational reasons. Or to be more precise: in 2016 those Americans who made a rational choice were outflanked by those Americans who acted atavistically, who felt, consciously or otherwise, that irrational times must be presided over by irrational authority. Believe me, I’m not trying to defend either Trump or his supporters; but we might at least entertain the notion that neoliberalism, populism, racism and capitalism are all, as systems, at least as bonkers as is their currently presiding deity.\n\nTrump is not much of a god. He is petty and inconstant, angry and vindictive, sensual and venal. But plenty of gods have been all those things, and that hasn’t stopped them being worshipped by swaths of humanity for thousands of years. Then again, Trump is not interested in ruling well, or rescuing the economy, or curating American prestige abroad. He is interested fundamentally in one thing only: in being worshipped. Gaiman’s novel says: but of course. That’s how gods are.\n\nBut Gaiman also understands something that perhaps Trump doesn’t: that being ignored is much worse, for a god, than being hated. The Cult of Trump will always have its acolytes, but it’s a relatively small congregation. Most of Trump’s congregation will shift their devotion to other things soon enough. Gaiman’s book understands this because it understands that the force that made Trump – TV – is a deity vastly more powerful than any subsidiary figure. People will still be worshipping Gaiman’s Media long after Trump is a historical curio."],[5,"Mark Warner Wants To Know How Russians Knew Best Ways To Help Trump","WASHINGTON – The top Democrat on the Senate panel investigating Russian interference in last year’s presidential campaign said Sunday that a major unresolved issue is how the Russians knew which states to target to help President Donald Trump.\n\n“This is one of the questions we have to sort through,” Virginia’s Mark Warner said on CNN’s State of the Union. “It does seem strange, it appears, that Russian-paid Internet trolls who created bots were then able to put forward fake news, selective stories in a way that seemed targeted.”\n\nHe added that while he knows of no iron-clad proof of collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign, “there is a lot of smoke.”\n\nCrucial to Trump winning the the White House was that he carried three states ― Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania ― by a combined margin of about 76,000 votes. Polls had shown Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leading in the trio of states, and all of them had been won by Democrats in the six presidential elections before last year’s vote.\n\nWarner in March told reporters that more than 1,000 paid Internet “trolls” working out of Russia sought to influence the 2016 election in Trump’s favor by disseminating unflattering and, at times, untrue information about Clinton.\n\nClinton in an interview last week also suggested that the Russians could not have known how to “weaponize” the emails they stole from the Democratic National Committee and from her campaign chairman, John Podesta, unless they had been helped “by Americans and guided by people who had polling and data information.”\n\nWarner and the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, North Carolina’s Richard Burr, have been examining the question of Russian meddling for months. Last month they issued subpoenas asking Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to turn over documents related to his contacts with Russia. Flynn has refused to comply with that order.\n\nFlynn was fired less than a month into the job after reports surfaced that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Russians, potentially making him a blackmail target.\n\nTrump has vehemently denied that his campaign colluded with the Russian intelligence agencies last year and has called the entire probe “fake news” generated by Democrats to explain how they lost an election they thought they would win.\n\nHe told the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador to the United States that he had fired FBI Director James Comey last month to take “great pressure” off of himself regarding the agency’s investigation into Flynn’s contact with Russian officials, according to a published report.\n\nComey is scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8 about Trump’s request that he drop the probe, which the then-FBI director refused.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia worked to hurt Clinton and help Trump during the 2016 election, in part by stealing documents and emails from the Democratic Party and from Clinton’s campaign chairman and then releasing embarrassing ones on a near daily basis in the final weeks of the campaign through WikiLeaks.\n\nTrump praised WikiLeaks for doing this in almost every campaign appearance in October, and for months claimed that it was impossible to know who had stolen the emails.\n\nThat Russian meddling, and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, remains under investigation by the FBI and committees in both the House and Senate. After Trump fired Comey, Trump’s Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller, who headed the FBI from 2001-2013, as special counsel to run the Russia investigation."],[5,"Escalating investigation puts Trump and his staff at legal odds","The legal interests of President Donald Trump and his aides are dramatically diverging as special counsel Robert Mueller expands his probe into possible obstruction of justice – and as the president ratchets up his attacks on the investigators.\n\nWhile Trump’s personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, recently told White House staffers they can rely on him, rather than hire their own lawyers, some of the people closest to Trump aren’t taking that advice.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nVice President Mike Pence, a likely witness as the investigation focuses on Trump’s firings of both White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James Comey, made the most public break yet in Trump’s innermost circle this week by confirming he’s retained a prominent Virginia GOP attorney to represent him.\n\n“Pence hiring a lawyer tells the White House staff two things: They’re all potential witnesses in this investigation and don’t listen to Marc Kasowitz,” said Adam Goldberg, a former Clinton White House crisis communications official.\n\nThe president is no stranger to civil suits from his years in the Trump Organization, but veterans of past Washington scandals and attorneys close to the case cautioned that a special counsel investigation is very different. In this instance, the president’s personal attorney has a clear conflict of interest and can’t legally represent White House aides, so any staff who follow his suggestion are vulnerable if they get swept up in the rapidly expanding special counsel and congressional investigations.\n\n“I just worry staffers in the White House will feel that it’s a test of their loyalty to Trump whether they’re willing to follow Kasowitz’s wishes. That could be very dangerous to them,” said William Jeffress, a white-collar attorney who represented Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, in the CIA leak investigation. “I kind of feel sorry for them in a way.”\n\nMore White House staffers are likely to hire lawyers and splinter off as the president’s response to the investigation grows increasingly aggressive. Trump on Friday morning further inflamed the controversy surrounding the Russia probe with a Twitter post that both acknowledged he’s under investigation for firing Comey and also appeared to attack his own deputy attorney general for launching the investigation in the first place.\n\n“I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,” the president tweeted.\n\nTrump’s tweet, coming at the end of a week where the president’s surrogates have openly mused about potentially firing special counsel Robert Mueller, stands in stark contrast to a wave of important developments on the special counsel front.\n\nMueller’s office confirmed for the first time Friday it's been hiring prosecution staff, with 13 lawyers already on board and, according to spokesman Peter Carr, “several more in the pipeline.” An attorney for Trump’s presidential transition team also sent a memo Thursday to a wide circle of aides and volunteers telling them to save all documents related to the Russia issue and specifically singling out materials involving five individuals who worked on the 2016 effort: former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and advisers Carter Page, Rick Gates, Roger Stone and Flynn.\n\nMichael Cohen, another longtime Trump personal lawyer, on Friday also officially named his outside counsel: Washington-based attorney Stephen Ryan. That flurry of activity — punctuated by Pence tapping former Virginia Attorney General Richard Cullen as his personal attorney — should serve as a clear signal that other Trump staffers should be looking beyond Kasowitz for advice, according to White House scandal veterans and lawyers close to the Russia probe.\n\n“It’s almost unimaginable that the words ‘you don’t need a lawyer’ can come out of a lawyer’s mouth,” said Peter Zeidenberg, who served on the DOJ special prosecution team during the Bush-era leak investigation and is now a partner at Arent Fox.\n\nEven those who think Kasowitz means well have their doubts. “If you’re not a lawyer and you don’t know lawyers you’re going to think Kasowitz is giving you good advice,” said Lanny Davis, a former senior Clinton White House adviser. “There’s not a single lawyer who’d not be worried about having a lawyer say you don’t need a lawyer. I’m sure Kasowitz doesn’t think it’s a conflict. I’m sure he believes he can give everyone good advice. He’d say our interests are all in alignment here. No, they’re not.”\n\nPersonal attorneys representing White House staffers were flummoxed after The New York Times reported last week that Kasowitz had suggested the Trump staffers didn’t yet need to hire their own lawyers.\n\n“I think he’s on very thin ice advising folks who are not his clients whether or not they need counsel,” said an attorney close to the Russia probe. “That’s certainly not something that I or any other experienced white-collar practitioner would do in similar circumstances.”\n\nSome of the attorneys reached out to their White House clients after the Times article was published and reiterated their warnings — even to the point of avoiding Kasowitz entirely. “Under no circumstance are you to speak to him. If you’re approached, please give him my name and have him call me,” said the lawyer close to the Russia probe.\n\nFor Trump, the outsourcing of his legal advice to Kasowitz makes sense because of a Clinton-era legal precedentthat protects his communications under attorney-client privilege — something he’d have far less control over if he were using lawyers from the White House Counsel’s Office. But Trump staffers aren’t afforded the same protections with Kasowitz. What’s more, staff who don’t have lawyers but work with Kasowitz are putting themselves in jeopardy — legally and politically.\n\n“If you’re a White House staffer who knows complicated facts that may implicate them or make them look bad, you’re not going to put your trust in Marc Kasowitz to make you come out looking the best,” said Goldberg, who served as a special associate counsel to Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. “His interest is making sure the president comes out looking the best. This is one of the many reasons it's masochistic to have a White House rapid response operation run by the president’s personal attorney. It’s consistent with the president who puts his own interests ahead of everyone else’s, including the presidency.”\n\nJane Sherburne, a former Clinton White House lawyer, said Trump staff who don’t have lawyers and keep talking with Kasowitz “may be at risk of making decisions or enabling the creation of a record without having fully understood the potential consequences for them.”\n\n“Even as Kasowitz may suggest their interests are aligned with Trump's, he is not in a position to evaluate that for the staff and they would be wise to get independent professional advice about their own risk,” she explained.\n\nAttorneys close to the Russia probe said they were also bothered by the arrangement Trump has established where all media inquiries about the Russia probe go to Kasowitz and longtime GOP strategist Mark Corallo. It’s an unprecedented set up that essentially outsources a key function of the White House to a personal attorney and outside media adviser who are representing Donald Trump, not the interests of the White House or the office of the presidency.\n\n“My impression is this is supposed to be temporary,” said a white-collar lawyer familiar with the arrangement. This source noted Trump White House officials are aware of the Clinton-era model for crisis management, where media inquiries remained inside the White House and the president’s personal lawyer played a less all-encompassing role in the overall strategy.\n\n“The problem with the plan is they’ve got a temporary situation with Kasowitz that could become permanent,” the lawyer said.\n\nStaffers without legal counsel also could put themselves at risk by speaking with the president’s lawyer and exposing themselves to charges of improper witness collusion — even if that’s not what they’re doing. In a typical scenario, defense lawyers working with the White House would establish a structure to talk among one another and share information — which would be subject to privilege protections and also ensure things aren’t shared without permission. Attorneys close to the Russia probe said nothing of the sort has been established yet in the Trump White House.\n\n“If he is talking to them without assurances, it leaves them unprotected,” Jeffress said.\n\nCorallo and the White House did not respond to requests for comment about their current arrangement.\n\nSome Trump allies, meantime, are shrugging off suggestions that they find independent legal advice. “That’s very nice to start distrust within the White House. I don’t give a shit,” said former Trump campaign adviser Sam Nunberg.\n\nThe White House, he said, “should be happy” that Trump has brought on board his longtime lawyer. “He’s the perfect attorney for this. He’s not someone who cares about his relationships in D.C.,” Nunberg said. “He’s one tough SOB.”"],[5,"Trump’s Paris withdrawal brings Bannon back to front row","Donald Trump’s “America first” agenda is back — though in truth it never went away. Whether Mr Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate deal marks the beginning of the end of America’s global leadership is an open question. But it puts an end to starry-eyed hopes about Mr Trump’s “normalisation”.\n\nIt was fitting that Steve Bannon, chief architect of the America first campaign, was sitting in the front row for Mr Trump’s rambling announcement. Conspicuously absent were Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the two figures on whom much of the world, including China, were banking to moderate Mr Trump’s actions. So much for the positive influence of the First Family. They failed on this very significant count.\n\nThe political signals are ominous. Since Mr Trump fired James Comey, the FBI director, last month, his White House has taken on a siege mentality.\n\nKey advisers, such as Jared Kushner, who had rashly advised his father-in-law that the Comey firing would be popular, and H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, have lost influence. Reince Priebus, the chief of staff and the most visible establishment Republican insider, looks unlikely to keep his job. Mr Trump is reportedly casting around for a replacement.\n\nMr Kushner, who himself is now a leading target of the Russia collusion investigation, is rumoured to be considering a return to his native New York.\n\nMost importantly, Mr Bannon is back in the driving seat. The more paranoid the atmosphere, the higher his stock. Mr Trump’s constant referral to a world that is laughing at America — a line he used to justify its withdrawal from the non-binding Paris deal — is a classic sign of such paranoia.\n\nMr Trump’s tendency to reject the path of least resistance is only likely to deepen in the near future. Next week, Mr Comey will testify on Capitol Hill about Russia’s role in influencing the US election. It is likely to be one of the most watched live testimonies in recent history. Mr Trump is unlikely to come off well. Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to lead the Russia investigation, has conferred extensively with Mr Comey in advance of the hearing. The more the investigation closes in, the tighter the dialectic of Trumpian paranoia.\n\nThe same applies to how Mr Trump filters the world’s almost uniformly negative reaction to his Paris announcement.\n\nIt matters little whether Mr Trump has an ideological commitment to the America First agenda. It fits the cloth of a besieged mentality. America first may turn into “America alone”, as Ivo Daalder, head of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, put it. In practice, that will increasingly mean “Trump alone”.\n\nRepublican colleagues, no less than European allies, will find it increasingly hard to stay on side. Mr Trump is notoriously loyal to nobody but himself. Even Mr Bannon knows that.\n\nThe big question for America and the world is who will stop Mr Trump from isolating himself still further?\n\nThe writer is the FT’s Washington columnist and commentator"],[5,"\"Complete Vindication For The President\"","National Security editor for Breitbart, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, was asked during an interview today to give his thoughts on the series of O’Keefe’s CNN tapes. In the series of tapes, a CNN producer can be clearly heard admitting that Trump/Russia collusion is “bullshit” and that the entire thing is a “witch hunt” to help CNN’s ratings. Gorka did not mince words when addressing the ramifications of these released tapes, and the (now public) exposure of CNN knowingly pushing false stories.\n\nVia Breitbart:\n\n“I think this is the day when the Left rues ever coming up with the phrase ‘Fake News’ because now we have the evidence. We have the consequences of systematic generation of Fake News, happening at the epicenter of one of the places that was producing the most of it,” he said.\n\n“It’s just a testament to the determination of the president,” Gorka continued. “He sticks with what he knows to be true. He hangs in there doggedly and finally. Thanks to intrepid people like James O’Keefe, we have the evidence, and people are getting fired.”"],[5,"Eric Trump: Democrats are \"Not Even People\"","Never before have we seen the family of a sitting U.S. President have so much say within the White House, than with the Trump family. Eric, Don Jr. and Ivanka Trump have played major roles within the Trump campaign as well as the current White House, whether it’s behind the scenes or in the public’s view.  They have also all been quite vocal, turning towards the media to express their political views and views towards their father.\n\nLast night on Sean Hannity’s show, Eric Trump made an appearance and what he said will likely have social  media buzzing for quite some time. Hannity began his show attacking the mainstream media and Democrats for pushing what he called “baseless Russian conspiracy theories.” Eric Trump then chimed in with his thoughts on Democrats who are fighting his father:\n\n“I’ve never seen hatred like this. I mean, to me, they’re not even people.”\n\nTrump then went on to describe Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez as a “total whackjob”, while complaining about all of the name-calling in politics. This short interview comes only days after Eric Trump made headlines calling the Trump/Russia investigation the ‘biggest hoax of all time”.\n\nWhile many political pundits may blow off Trump’s recent remarks as him simply sticking up for his father, the remarks are quite concerning to others. Many authoritative figures and war criminals in the past have dehumanized those they are fighting against in an effort to rationalize any future or past crimes against them. If the elder Trump sees Democrats in the same light, then it’s quite frightening to think what exactly could be going through his mind, and what he may do if the noose around his neck begins to tighten as the Russian investigation moves along.  It’s one thing for the son of a sitting President to dehumanize his father’s opposition, but an entirely different, and far more frightening thing for a sitting President to."],[5,"Trump's son-in-law launches Middle East peace effort","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, met Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Wednesday to try to revive long-fractured Middle East peacemaking that Washington acknowledged will take some time.\n\nKushner, a 36-year-old real estate developer with little experience of international diplomacy or political negotiation, arrived in Israel on Wednesday morning and was due to spend barely 20 hours on the ground.\n\nVideo showed him giving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a friend of Kushner’s father, a handshake and a hug as they prepared to sit down with the Israeli ambassador to Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Israel and other senior officials for preliminary discussions.\n\n“This is an opportunity to pursue our common goals of security, prosperity and peace,” Netanyahu said. “Jared, I welcome you here in that spirit. I know of your efforts, the president’s efforts, and I look forward to working with you to achieve these common goals.”\n\nKushner replied: “The president sends his best regards and it’s an honor to be here with you.”\n\nKushner did not speak to the media or take questions, maintaining the circumspect profile he has established since Trump took office in January.\n\nU.S. officials and Israeli leaders “underscored that forging peace will take time and stressed the importance of doing everything possible to create an environment conducive to peacemaking,” the White House later said in a statement.\n\nKushner traveled to Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for two hours of talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas after iftar, the evening meal that breaks the daily Ramadan fast.\n\nAbbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said all major issues at the heart of the conflict were discussed.\n\nU.S. officials called the trip part of an effort to keep the conversation going rather than the launching of a new phase in the peace process, saying that Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, the president’s special representative for international negotiations, are likely to return often.\n\nTrump has described peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians as “the ultimate deal” and made it a priority. As well as receiving both Netanyahu and Abbas in the White House, he visited the region last month.\n\nBut it remains unclear what approach Trump, via Kushner and Greenblatt, plans to take on resolving one of the world’s most intractable conflicts.\n\nFor at least two decades, the goal of U.S.-led diplomacy has been a “two-state solution”, meaning an independent Palestinian state living side-by-side and at peace with Israel.\n\nBut when Trump met Netanyahu in Washington in February, he said he was not fixed on two states saying, “I‘m looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like”.\n\n12 ‘BULLET POINTS’\n\nNetanyahu has in the past given conditional backing to two states. But ahead of his last election victory in 2015, he promised there would never be a Palestinian state on his watch, a remark seen as an attempt to shore up right-wing support.\n\nIn discussions with Greenblatt before Kushner’s visit, Palestinian sources said the phrase “two-state solution” had not been used.\n\nPalestinian sources said that ahead of Kushner’s meeting with Abbas, they had been asked to draw up a list of 12 “bullet point” demands they would want met in any negotiations.\n\nThey saw it as a helpful exercise in focusing on core elements rather than an oversimplification of a complex issue.\n\nTrump administration officials have said that if they are going to make progress on peace, they do not want to get bogged down in process but to move rapidly on tackling what are known as “final status” issues, the complexities around Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, water resources, security and borders.\n\nThose have long been thorny problems in the multiple rounds of peace negotiations launched by both Republican and Democratic presidents since the mid-1990s. It remains unclear what new approach Trump’s administration may have to untangling disputes that blend politics, land, religion and ethnicity and have defied resolution for 70 years."],[5,"Why you should care about increasing secrecy in White House and Senate","And lack of accessibility is only half the problem. Lack of accuracy in official statements is a big issue too.\n\nCNN's senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta was channeling other reporters on Monday when he threw his hands up in the air and said the administration is \"stonewalling.\"\n\nThe president's anti-media defenders may support the administration's approach, but it's hard to justify the rollback in accountability. It's not just the White House, either: the State Department and the Pentagon have all but stopped holding on-camera briefings, too.\n\nAsk yourself: do you want to know more or less about what Trump, his aides and his allies are doing? If you're a Trump supporter and you're OK with his secrecy, how would you feel if this were a Democratic administration?\n\n\"This isn't about us\" as journalists, \"it's about public's right to get answers from the government,\" Julie Pace, the Washington bureau chief for the AP, tweeted Monday night.\n\nThis isn't exclusive to the executive branch. There are heightened concerns about legislative branch secrecy as well.\n\nRepublican leaders are crafting the Senate version of a bill to replace Obamacare behind closed doors, essentially preventing the press from informing the public about what's in a law that would affect tens of millions of people and a major segment of the economy until the last minute before a vote.\n\n\"I have covered every major health bill in Congress since 1986. Have NEVER seen anything like this,\" Julie Rovner, the chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News, said last week.\n\nBack at the White House, briefings are getting shorter and taking place less often. Now there are reports that press secretary Sean Spicer will eventually leave the podium, but there's no word on who will replace him.\n\nIf you feel like you haven't seen Spicer in a while, that's because most of this month's briefings have taken place off-camera. While past administrations have sometimes held similar off-camera sessions, Trump's press shop has been doing it more often.\n\nEarlier this month the White House took another step backward and forbid TV and radio networks from broadcasting the audio from off-camera briefings.\n\nThe upshot? Spicer's dodges, gaffes, and non-answers are not heard by the public.\n\nOn Tuesday, Spicer will be holding an on-camera briefing -- his first in eight days.\n\n\"It just feels like we're slowly but surely being dragged into what is a new normal in this country, where the president of the U.S. is allowed to insulate himself from answering hard questions,\" Acosta said Monday.\n\nMany of the press shop's answers aren't really answers at all. Transcripts of recent briefings show dozens of \"I don't know's\" and \"I'll get back to you's.\"\n\nAgain, this isn't unique to the Trump administration, but it's much more pronounced nowadays.\n\nOn Monday Spicer said he still didn't have answers to some of the questions that journalists have been asking for weeks, like \"does the president believe in manmade climate change?\" and \"is he secretly recording conversations in the Oval Office?\"\n\nSpicer pushed off the tapes question, saying the president would \"probably\" answer it \"by the end of this week.\"\n\nWhile the president frequently opines via Twitter, he rarely fields questions from journalists.\n\nHis last national interview was more than five weeks ago, shortly after he fired FBI director James Comey. He usually declines to answer when reporters shout questions during photo ops.\n\nBy almost every measure, the Trump White House has reduced transparency about the workings of government. Trump reversed the Obama administration's policy of releasing White House visitor logs, for example.\n\nThe rollback is even visible on the main White House web site, which contains a lot less information than it did during the Obama years.\n\nObama's press shop had its own shortcomings, as did the Bush White House before it. But instead of one-upping their predecessors by offering more transparency, opening the door more widely, the Trump White House has been closing the door."],[5,"US diplomat in China quits 'over Trump climate change policy'","A top diplomat at the US embassy in Beijing has stepped down, apparently because he disagreed with President Donald Trump's climate change policy.\n\nThe state department said Deputy Chief of Mission David Rank had resigned.\n\nUS media outlets say he stepped down over Mr Trump's controversial announcement last week that the US was withdrawing from the Paris agreement.\n\nThe US embassy in Beijing told the BBC it was Mr Rank's personal decision and his years of service were appreciated.\n\nBefore becoming president, Mr Trump had said climate change was a hoax created by China to undermine US manufacturing.\n\nHe has said withdrawing the US from the 2015 Paris agreement - under which 188 countries committed to limiting rises in global temperatures - would protect the US economy.\n\nBut his decision to do so last week was met with much criticism worldwide.\n\nThe New York Timesquoted unnamed friends of Mr Rank as saying he was deeply frustrated about the US policy toward China, particularly regarding climate change.\n\nThe embassy in Beijing did not comment on reports that he had told embassy staff he could not defend the decision and did not want to present formal notification to Chinese authorities.\n\nMr Rank joined the state department in 1990 and had previously served in Afghanistan, Taiwan, Greece and Mauritius, according to his profile page which was still on the Beijing embassy's website as of Tuesday.\n\nAppointed in January 2016, he was effectively the top US diplomat in China as he was also the acting ambassador. Terry Branstad, who was selected by Mr Trump for the post, fills that position later this month.\n\nThe state department said the embassy's economics councillor Jonathan Fritz would be filling in behind Mr Rank immediately."],[5,"New York Times Gets Defensive After Comey Calls Them Out For Fake News","As The New York Times reports, Comey – while speaking before the Senate Intelligence Committee – stated that this New York Times article from February alleging through anonymous sources that members of the Trump campaign team had contact with Russian intelligence officials was “not true.”\n\nIn its rebuke of Comey’s statement, the outlet asserts that “multiple news outlets have since published accounts that support the main elements of The Times’s article, including information about phone calls and in-person meetings between Mr. Trump’s advisers and Russians.”\n\nThe Times goes on to insist that “Mr. Comey did not say exactly what he believed was incorrect about the article, which was based on information from four current and former American officials.”\n\nAs for those anonymous officials, The Times states they “could not immediately be reached after Mr. Comey’s remarks,” despite having corroborated the report in the months since its publishing.\n\n“One possible area of dispute,” The Times writes, “is the description of the Russians involved. Some law enforcement officials took issue with the Times account in the days after it was published, saying that the intelligence was still murky, and that the Russians who were in contact with Mr. Trump’s advisers did not meet the F.B.I.’s black-and-white standard of who can be considered an ‘intelligence officer.'”\n\nThe Times goes on to argue that several “former American intelligence and law enforcement officials” (more anonymous sources, yay) “have a broader definition, especially when it comes to Russia.”\n\nThe Times further names Roger Stone as an example of a Trump associate who allegedly had contact with Russian intelligence officials – despite the man’s repeated characterization of that contact as benign.\n\nThis is an issue Republicans have also deeply contested is being blown out of proportion.\n\nDuring an interview with CNN’s Alisyn Camerota, former Chief of Staff under George H.W. Bush John Sununu let loose on the assertion that Kushner’s meeting with the Russian bank official is noteworthy, stating that, “during the 10 weeks everybody is trying to meet somebody who’s going to be in the administration.”\n\n“Everybody who’s involved in business, everybody who’s involved in politics. I can’t tell you how many people tried to meet with me during the time I was named Chief of Staff.”\n\nOn the topic of anonymous sources, Comey stated during his testimony today that, “the challenge – and I’m not picking on reporters — about writing stories about classified information, is the people talking about it often don’t really know what’s going on, and those of us who actually know what’s going on are not talking about it.”\n\n“We don’t call the press and say, ‘Hey, you got that thing wrong.’”"],[5,"After Comey’s dismissal, it’s time for a commission","IT MUST have seemed like a good idea at the time. Why not get rid of an irksomely independent FBI director, who was making trouble for Donald Trump’s White House, by exploiting his mishandling of Hillary Clinton’s e-mails? After all, Mrs Clinton believes that James Comey cost her the presidency with a letter informing Congress in October that he was reopening the investigation into her use of a private e-mail server. Surely Democrats would be glad to see the back of him.\n\nMr Trump has the power to sack Mr Comey. But nobody will be fooled by the quasi-prosecutorial memo drawn up by the deputy attorney-general, Rod Rosenstein, at the president’s request. If the trouble were Mr Comey’s handling of Mrs Clinton’s e-mails, he could have been sacked four months ago. Indeed, Mr Trump had praised Mr Comey’s October letter, saying it had taken “a lot of guts”.\n\nThat leaves two interpretations (see article). Either Mr Comey was dismissed in an effort to undermine an investigation into collusion between members of Mr Trump’s campaign and Russians trying to subvert the election. Or Mr Trump got rid of him in a fit of pique. Maybe Mr Comey was just too big for his boots, too unwilling to take the president’s paranoid notions seriously—say, by failing to credit his idea that Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower. Either way, the sacking of Mr Comey reflects terribly on Mr Trump.\n\nThere is as yet no proof that aides close to Mr Trump were conspiring with Russian intelligence agents. But officials and the president’s toadies in Congress, such as Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, have behaved as if there was something to hide. Mr Nunes had to withdraw from his committee’s investigation after appearing desperate to do the bidding of the White House. The attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, who gave misleading testimony about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador, has similarly recused himself. Mike Flynn had to quit as national security adviser after lying about his dealings with the Russians. Mr Comey’s defenestration just as he was asking Mr Rosenstein for more resources to look into Russia only fuels suspicions of a cover-up.\n\nIf Mr Trump is lashing out at an uppity underling, that too is a bad sign. It suggests the president does not respect the vital principle of an independent, non-political FBI—which, for all his faults, Mr Comey represented. Taken with the contempt Mr Trump has shown for judges who challenge his executive orders, America’s system of checks and balances is under stress.\n\nSome, including Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat, have called for an independent counsel to continue the investigation. But there is a problem. It would be the now-compromised Mr Rosenstein who would be responsible for making the appointment and for oversight of what followed.\n\nCountry first\n\nCongress must now uphold constitutional norms. Any successor to Mr Comey nominated by the president must face the most rigorous examination of their impartiality. But that will not be enough. What is needed is either an independent commission, along the lines of the one set up to inquire into the events leading up to September 11th 2001, or a bipartisan select committee to investigate the Russia allegations. Neither would have prosecutorial powers, but they could have substantial investigatory resources and be able to subpoena witnesses. There is no reason why prosecutions could not follow once they had reported. Principled Senate Republicans, such as Richard Burr, Ben Sasse and John McCain, are troubled by what the removal of Mr Comey portends. It is high time for them and others to put their country before their party."],[5,"Europe 'astonished' after Donald Trump labels Nato 'obsolete'","European nations have said they are “astonished” by President-elect Donald Trump’s claim Nato was “obsolete”. \n\nThey also reacted with surprise and defiance at his suggestion more member states would join Britain in leaving the 28-nation EU.\n\nDuring an interview with The Times, Mr Trump said Britain’s decision to leave the EU would “end up being a great thing” and reiterated his claim that Nato is “obsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror”.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, speaking ahead of an EU foreign ministers’ meeting, said Mr Trump’s view on Nato and criticism that allied members weren’t paying their fair share has “caused astonishment”. \n\nHis French counterpart Jean-Marc Ayrault added that the best response to such an interview was simple – Europeans uniting.\n\nIn Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was pressing the President-elect for a meeting in the spring.\n\nMerkel had offered to meet Trump in the United States in her capacity as chairman of the Group of 20 leading economies, the sources said.\n\nThe chancellor has spoken with Trump only once, shortly after his election to succeed U.S. President Barack Obama\n\nMr Trump’s positions have been “long known” but added: “I think we Europeans have our fate in our own hands.” \n\n“I’m personally going to wait until the American president takes office, and then we will naturally work with him on all levels,” she told reporters. \n\nIn the interview, Mr Trump avoided saying who he trusted more, Ms Merkel, a longtime US-ally, or Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“Well, I start off trusting both – but let’s see how long that lasts,” he said. “It may not last long at all.”\n\nDespite saying he had “great respect” for the German leader, Mr Trump said she had made a “catastrophic mistake” by welcoming an unlimited number of refugees to her country.\n\nHe also suggested the December Christmas market attack by a Tunisian man was one effect of Ms Merkel’s policies.\n\nMs Merkel is working to set a date for a meeting with Mr Trump in spring, Reuters reports. \n\nShe has reportedly offered to meet Mr Trump in the United States in her capacity as chairman of the Group of 20 leading economies.\n\nThe chancellor has spoken with Mr Trump only once, shortly after his election to succeed US President Barack Obama.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies"],[5,"Trump's lawyer: Comey violated executive privilege. 10 legal experts: No, he didn't.","After the public testimony of former FBI Director James Comey on Thursday, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, released a statement. In addition to being riddled with typos, it contained a curious legal argument.\n\nKasowitz contended that Comey broke the law by leaking memos about his private conversations with the president — what the statement called an “unauthorized disclosure of private information.”\n\nThe not-so-subtle implication here is that any and every conversation with the president is privileged, and therefore protected under the law. That’s a rather broad interpretation of executive privilege, and one that 10 legal experts disputed in interviews with Vox.\n\nExecutive privilege exists for a reason: to protect against the forced disclosures of classified or confidential executive branch communications. But here’s the problem: The conversations between Trump and Comey were not classified. Moreover, because the president himself has publicly referred to the conversations in question, he has already waived any claim for executive privilege. That Comey is now a private citizen also weakens the Kasowitz’s claim that he’s bound to secrecy.\n\nThere is, however, little settled law on the question of executive privilege. So I reached out to 10 legal experts and asked them if Kasowitz’s interpretation of executive privilege makes any sense. Every one of them said it doesn’t.\n\nYou can read their full responses below.\n\nTrump waived any claim on executive privilege when he wrote in an official presidential statement a reference to the \"three times\" Comey told him he was not personally under investigation. By referring publicly to their conversations and this content, he waived his claim for privilege and secrecy of those exchanges. Moreover, the Trump administration did not invoke the privilege before today, so they are trying to slam the door on the barn after the horse has already run away, as they say. It's not only a practical problem, it's also a legal problem. Courts are not going to take this claim seriously when the president had notice of the testimony and did nothing at the appropriate time. It's just a \"make-weight\" argument to throw in a letter when a lawyer does not have a strong coherent argument. It's legal noise without substance. Executive privilege is not absolute. The Supreme Court inU.S. v. Nixon, the major Watergate case, held that executive privilege must be balanced with the public right to know. The Court rejected Nixon's argument that he had an \"absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity.\" Even if Trump had never waived the privilege with his tweets and his official statement firing Trump, a court could have followed U.S. v. Nixon and found that the public interest outweighs the interests of the executive. Finally, Kasowitz condemns Comey for \"leaks.\" A leak is not any conversation. It specifically means the release of secret or classified information. 1) None of this material was classified, as Comey carefully and clearly explained. Kasowitz was not paying attention and/or does not understand the meaning of the word \"leak.\" 2) Comey is a private citizen, and he has no duty to conceal nonclassified conversation now. He also was sharing the information with a private citizen. 3) So Kasowitz's letter is really an attack on private free speech by stretching the word leak to cover any conversation by a former government official about nonclassified information and events.\n\nThe statement is somewhat ambiguous — probably by design. Which privilege applies here? It's clearly not attorney-client privilege, since Comey was acting in his capacity as FBI director, not as an attorney. In terms of executive privilege, there's no statutory law codifying the exact contours of the privilege, and I would consider it anomalous if executive privilege could shield an ongoing obstruction of justice. And I seriously doubt that a federal court would interpret executive privilege to shield an obstruction of justice. In any event, the whole issue is largely irrelevant. Comey already testified. Whether he violated executive privilege or not doesn't change the fact that he's now disclosed what happened in his meetings with Trump. Violating executive privilege isn't a crime. And it is important to distinguish between a putative rule of evidence and an affirmative defense. Executive privilege is not a defense. So even if Comey violated executive privilege it wouldn't change the fact that Trump obstructed justice, or acted corruptly, in firing Comey to stymie a federal investigation into his campaign or administration.\n\nThere is no such thing as “privileged information.” There is such a thing as “executive privilege” but the memo (no doubt deliberately) does not mention “executive privilege.” In any event, executive privilege has a specialized meaning and refers only to the president’s ability to prevent a subordinate from testifying. Finally, disclosure of classified information is a crime. Trump’s lawyer is making a political argument, not a legal argument. The political argument is that Comey was biased against Trump and out to get him (hence Comey leaked bad things about Trump but not good things), and that Comey confirmed that Trump was not being investigated for the Russia ties. And also note, back to the legal issue, that Trump did not assert executive privilege against Comey, so it is a non-issue even if Trump could have.\n\n“Privileged” seems to mean confidential in the statement — it isn’t really being used as a term of art because there has been no assertion of privilege by the president. There is very little law on executive privilege. Most of the disputes over the assertion of privilege that have arisen with respect to congressional testimony have been resolved through negotiation. It’s rarely litigated, and there are some unanswered questions. There is a sort of presumption that conversations with the president about the business of the executive branch are privileged and confidential, but that doesn’t mean that everything the president says is privileged. It wouldn’t cover, for example, references to campaign activities before the president took office, or the president discussing topics beyond his duties and authority. Director Comey may have concluded that the irregularity, impropriety, and even potential criminality in these encounters precluded any assertion of privilege. Privileges can be waived when the privilege-holder has publicly disclosed the conversations in question — which was the case here with respect to some of the meetings between the president and Director Comey.\n\nIt’s not true that any and all conversations with the president are protected under executive privilege — not even if it's limited to private conversations with the president. It depends on the content and the context. If Trump and Comey talk about baseball, that's not privileged. Ditto if some hypothetical president told an adviser to bribe a witness or destroy evidence — or commit any other criminal act. How does that apply here? Who knows. It's a murky area without a lot of clear law. In 1974 in U.S. v. Nixon, the Supreme Court recognized a constitutionally based privilege that protects confidential communications between a president and his or her immediate advisers — but it's qualified. In particular, the Court said it had to give way in that case because the evidence was relevant to a criminal investigation. If that executive privilege is the privilege that Kasowitz has in mind, a court would have to determine if it applies to these communications. (Was Comey a \"close adviser\"? Was the content confidential? Was it relevant to the president's official duties? and so forth.) That process requires an inquiry into the content of the communications, which is probably disputed. And then there's the question of whether any possible privilege was waived. If Trump himself has talked publicly or tweeted about some of these conversations, that could easily mean he has waived any such privilege and can no longer claim that it exists. The government also has a privilege to prevent the disclosure of military, national security, or diplomatic secrets — basically classified information. Comey said that none of what he's described in testimony or memos about conversations with Trump was classified. That sounds right to me — privileged or not, none of this soundslike classified information — but others may know better. The clearest point in this foggy mess is the dog that didn't bark: Trump and his advisers and lawyers knew for weeks that Comey was going to testify today about his conversations with the president, but (from what I've read) they did nothing to assert any sort of privilege. Why not? I have no idea. Maybe they concluded that they had no claim. Maybe they were just as happy, under the circumstances, to have Comey testify at this hearing. Maybe they did not relish the prospect of litigating the existence of a privilege and addressing the sort of issues I've mentioned in the federal courts. Whatever the reason, that failure to claim any privilege could easily mean that if the president had a privilege to prevent these disclosure, it's now gone forever.\n\nThere's a presidential deliberative privilege that some contend to all discussions with the president. It's clearly not absolute in connection with court proceedings and it's also clearly available. It's not clear that there's anything unlawful about a private person's disclosure of material covered by the privilege. You have to distinguish between executive privilege, which typically involves issues of national security, the deliberative privilege, which involves anything that might have to do with any kind of presidential decision-making (and so it’s quite a bit broader). One thing, which is flagged indirectly in Kasowitz's statement, is that leaking something covered by executive privilege might violate some laws about national security information, but it's not clear that leaking material covered only by the deliberative privilege violates any criminal statute. (It might, but it's not clear that it does.) I think that the president and his allies are trying to blur the distinction between the deliberative privilege and executive privilege.\n\nAs a general matter, the president can withhold documents or testimony from Congress on the grounds that such information, if made public, would damage the national interest. In particular, our constitutional tradition has recognized that presidents must be free to receive candid advice from officers in the executive branch, and that the quality of such consultation and deliberation would be damaged if Congress or the courts could easily force the executive branch to open them to public scrutiny. If Comey were still the director of the FBI and Congress wanted to inquire into what Comey and the president discussed in private meetings, it would be reasonable for the president to refuse to allow him to testify. At that point, it would be up to Congress as to how far they wanted to push the issue in order to gain access to that information. But Comey is now a private citizen, and not within the control of the president. The president is no longer in a position to deny Congress access to Comey's testimony. Moreover, Comey is willing to voluntarily discuss his conversations with the president, so any concern that we might have about the chilling effect of coercive congressional intrusion into those conversations is negated. No executive branch official can be deterred from offering frank advice to the president by the possibility that that same official will at some point in the future want to tell the story of what happened in that meeting. The nation's interest in preserving executive privilege does not extend to voluntary revelations of the president's own statements. The only interest being served in that case would appear to be Donald Trump's own personal interest.\n\nIt is not entirely clear what the statement means by \"privileged communications.\" It may or may not refer to the constitutional doctrine of executive privilege. Assuming that it does, the Supreme Court did hold, in a 1974 case involving then-President Richard Nixon, that there is a limited privilege to withhold certain communications among executive branch officials. But even once this privilege is invoked — and it does not appear clearly to have been invoked here — it cannot prevent disclosure of communications in all circumstances. The Court wrote in the Nixon case that the privilege \"must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial,\" for instance. Additionally, if a speaker himself discloses the communications, they are no longer privileged, and others in the conversation also are free to talk. This latter instance has particular relevance here, given that the president himself publicly has referred to his communications with Comey.\n\nIn order for the privilege to exist, the president must assert it. If the lawyer really believed the privilege was at stake, he would have claimed privilege at the hearing yesterday, since many of Comey’s comments at the hearing were descriptions of his one-on-one conversations with the president. In any event, if Congress, a special prosecutor, or a prosecutor can show a “particularized need” for the statements asserted to be privileged, such as a need for evidence to support a criminal prosecution, and also show that the need outweighs the executive’s desire for secrecy, the privilege does not apply. In United States v. Nixon, the Supreme Court upheld an order requiring President Nixon to provide evidence over a claim of executive privilege, stating that “to withhold evidence that is demonstrably relevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due process of law and gravely impair the basic function of the courts.”\n\nConversations with the president about matters within at least the outer perimeters of his official role are subject to claims of presidential communications privilege, the precise category of executive privilege involved in United States v. Nixon. In other words, if Trump had claimed privilege and Mr. Comey had decided to honor that claim, the committee, if intent on obtaining his testimony, might have had to persuade a court that its legitimate need for access to the information was weightier in this context than the president's general interest in confidentiality. (My guess is that Congress would have won that battle.) But even if the conversation was privileged in this sense, there is no law prohibiting someone in conversation with the president from revealing that conversation to third parties without the president's consent. We're in the realm of norms, not statutes. The information was not classified. Unauthorized disclosures of confidential conversations could, of course, be a firing offense for a federal officer serving at the pleasure of the president. But you can only fire someone once."],[5,"John Oliver: Even Fox News 'struggled to spin any positives' from James Comey's testimony on Donald Trump","John Oliverhas continued to lambast Donald Trump’s administration, on the latest episode ofLast Week Tonight discussing the ‘damning’ James Comey testimonial. \n\nOnce again calling the scandal ‘Stupid Watergate’, the host explained how the former FBI director saying Trump fired him over the Russian investigation was hardly revolutionary, Trump himself having already admitted to as much.\n\n“Donald Trump’s lies are never plain and simple,” Oliver said. “They’re like an everlasting gobstopper [from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]. You’ll never make it through every layer because it was made by an insane person who should never be in charge of anything.”\n\nOne of the many areas Comey discussed further during the testimonial was a meeting with Trump where the President asked multiple times for loyalty.\n\n“He is is describing his meeting with the president like a person who thought he was about to be murdered,” the host joked.\n\nThere was also further talk about the pair’s one-on-one meal, which Comey admitted was a surprise, having expected more people to be present.\n\nOliver continued: “It’s better to have a dinner alone with Trump than have Jared Kushner there too, just staring at you silently with his creepy, dead eyes.”\n\nThe host also went after Fox News, detailing how the broadcaster “struggled to spin any positives.” A montage of various Fox pundits talking about the testimonial — in which they questioned the President’s credibility as well as labelling the situation as “damning” and “politically damaging”. \n\nThe most “infuriating” response, though, was not Trump’s paradoxical Tweet the next day, but Paul Ryan’s defence. “The President is new to this,” Ryan said, Oliver explain how that just “proves that you can live a normal healthy life without a spine.” Watch in full below.\n\nLast week, Oliver spoke about the London and Manchester terror attack incidents, saying: “In no way is Britain under siege.

Word from Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, is that a final bill would pass overwhelmingly and that the votes will likely be there in the House, too, to override a presidential veto. When sanctions were imposed in 2014 and reinforced in late 2016, they took the form of an executive order, but if Mr. Graham and his colleagues have their way, the new, tougher sanctions regime will become law.\n\nThe senators leading the way are right on the policy: Russia needs to pay a significant price for its cyberwarfare against the United States and other adversaries need to be deterred. Mr. Putin’s aim is the survival of his regime. Russia’s longer-term grand strategy, such as it is, consists of hoping that the West weakens or even collapses, and helping that dissolution along. The stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nAs our lawmakers put financial pressure on Moscow, the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and the special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating allegations that the Trump campaign might have coordinated with Russian intelligence on the hacking and tarnishing of the Clinton campaign. Americans will eventually learn the truth.\n\nBut we don’t need to wait for their official reports to know that the notion that the Russians sought out the help of the Trump campaign is hilarious. It would be like LeBron James asking me for shooting tips. I play pickup, but c’mon.\n\nAnyone who knows the likes of Carter Page or Roger Stone, or even more seasoned bumblers like Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, would laugh at the idea that the Russians needed their assistance. Did some of the characters in Mr. Trump’s circle seek to ratchet up their status or fatten their wallets by sucking up to Russians and wittingly or unwittingly expose themselves to foreign intelligence operatives? Maybe. Yet the collusion story is ultimately a sideshow. What’s consequential is the tale of Russia’s penetration of Trumpworld in order to try to influence United States policy.\n\nMr. Putin may be strategically vacuous — look at Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela — but he is tactically agile, particularly when it comes to covert ops. Mr. Trump, for many years, was talking to Russian oligarchs and, according to Russian officials, became a walking listening device for the Kremlin. Is it true? We shall learn in due course, when penetration rather than collusion rightly takes center stage.\n\nThe root of the unfolding political fiasco for Mr. Trump is that as a candidate and as president-elect he reportedly sought to do something beyond daft: to lift sanctions on Russia right after they had blatantly meddled in an election partly on his behalf. It’s no surprise that speculation has been feverish that he must be guilty of collusion or even of opening himself up to blackmail.\n\nBut who needs blackmail when Mr. Trump has genuine affection for strongmen like Mr. Putin (see also: Egypt, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia). His corresponding dislike for democratic and female leaders like Angela Merkel, who happen to be constrained by the rule of law, also seems sincere. Furthermore, it is possible that the president has implored various government officials to deny collusion publicly because there was none on his part, and he views the frenzy over it as a concerted effort to delegitimize his election victory. (To some extent, it is.) Mr. Comey’s shrewd performance under oath on Thursday, however, amplified the prospect that Mr. Trump’s ham-handedness will mire his presidency in charges of obstruction of justice.\n\nAn investigation into Trumpworld for collusion, moreover, could morph into the equivalent of looking for bacteria on a pile of dung. Large parts of the overpriced real estate sector involve money laundering, with Russian, Chinese, Arab and even Iranian money.\n\nThat said, the irony is that Mr. Trump’s Putinophilia is correct in an unwitting way: The United States needs Russia inside the international order for its own security and global stability. Attempted isolation, which President Obama pursued, failed spectacularly. The 2016 election interference was a dramatic reminder that Russia is out there and must be reckoned with. A policy of waiting for the “inevitable” regime collapse from its economic failures misunderstands how Russia works. The only viable option is to engage. But contra Mr. Trump, that must be done from a position of strength.\n\nWhat will come of Mr. Trump? Beyond the infamous associates of his chaos campaign, he has assembled numerous outstanding individuals in his administration, and the more I interact with them the more I feel they are characters in a Greek tragedy, whose central figure suffers from a ruinous character flaw. Last week, despite Mr. Trump’s efforts to sideline him, Mr. Comey returned to the stage, and his part in the drama won’t end any time soon. Unlike Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump’s fate will be determined by the institutions of our democracy, which have proved more resilient than perhaps all but our 18th-century founding fathers anticipated."],[5,"Report: Donald Trump moved kids-cancer donations into his own business via golf events","According to a Forbes report, a cancer charity managed by Eric Trump -- son of President Donald Trump -- paid the Trump Organization more than $1.2 million for fundraising golf events despite Eric's claims that the charity was able to use Trump facilities for free. Writer Dan Alexander cited two sources claiming it was President Trump himself who directed the Trump Organization to charge Eric's group for use of property.\n\nMoreover, the Donald J. Trump Foundation -- already under the spotlight for questionable philanthropic efforts -- reportedly directed $100,000 in donations to the Trump Organization through Eric Trump's foundation as revenue. And though benefactors were told their donations were heading to children's cancer research and treatment, more than $500,000 was redistributed to other organizations, most of which were connected to Trump family members and groups that consequently paid to host golf events at Trump venues.\n\nAccording to Ian Gillule, who worked as membership and marketing director at Trump National Westchester, when President Trump initially learned of the free usage, he \"had a cow.\"\n\n\"He flipped,\" Gillule told Forbes. \"He said, 'I don't care if it's my son or not -- everybody gets billed.' \"\n\nAlexander notes in the Forbes story that such practices appear to defy federal tax rules and state laws that ban self-dealing and misleading donors.\n\nThe Trump Organization is deeply involved with golf around the globe.

Unlike the real Mr. T, who starred in the popular 1980s American television series The A-Team, however, President Trump is unable to muscle his way to victory. Quite the contrary. Thanks to majority leader Mitch McConnell’s sudden decision yesterday to abandon a vote on the Republican health care bill that would strip some 22 million Americans of coverage, Trump is maintaining a perfect batting average of zero on passing any major legislation. After seven years of huffing and puffing about the perfidies of ObamaCare and of promising to repeal Obama’s signature initiative immediately, it’s starting to look like Groundhog Day for the Republican party. The only thing that the bill seemed to unify was Republican and Democratic Governors in denouncing it.\n\nThe danger for the GOP is that in pushing the vote past July 4th, America’s celebration of independence from George III, a true revolt may once more emerge among voters against the prospect of losing social benefits, further cowing Republican senators from supporting a repudiation of ObamaCare. How long Trump will focus on healthcare, however, is an open question. It is clearly Russia that is on his mind.\n\nEven as his son-in-law Jared Kushner adds prominent lawyers to his legal defense team, Trump continues to careen about, maintaining one week that the allegations of Russian interference are ‘FAKE NEWS’, to saying that President Obama is at fault for not stymieing Moscow in the summer of 2016. Trump’s latest missive is the contention that ‘The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia … under a magnifying glass, they have zero ‘tapes’ of T people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology!’ Whether or not ‘T people’ were colluding with Moscow’s minions remains an open question as does the question of who is supposed to apologise to him, but the Washington Post—another outlet that Trump has deemed a purveyor of fake news and a failing institution—reported today that former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page has extensively talked with FBI investigators.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump seized upon the news that CNN has retracted a story about Russia and Trump and accepted the resignations of three staffers associated with the piece as prima facie evidence of the widespread corruption of the media. ‘Ratings Way Down!’, he announced on Twitter. Actually, they aren’t. CNN had double-digit growth in its last quarter. But, hey, who expects accuracy from a president who, as was reported today by the indefatigable David A. Fahrenthold, has phoney Time magazine covers of himself dated March 1, 2009 ostentatiously displayed in several of his golf clubs? Tsk, tsk, T."],[5,"FBI chief sacking: Trump warns Comey over leaks to media","US President Donald Trump has warned fired FBI chief James Comey against leaking material to the media.\n\nHe tweeted that Mr Comey had \"better hope there are no 'tapes' of our conversations\", suggesting such tapes, if they existed, might contradict him.\n\nMr Comey, who had been leading an inquiry into possible collusion between Trump election campaign officials and Russia, was fired on Tuesday.\n\nMr Trump has insisted Mr Comey told him that he was not under investigation.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer later said Mr Trump had nothing more to say on the \"tapes\" but that the tweet the president had put out was \"not a threat\" to Mr Comey.\n\nMr Trump has said that Mr Comey has told him three times that he was not a target of the FBI inquiry, comments that have raised accusations among opponents that the president was interfering in the investigation.\n\nMr Trump also said this week that he alone was responsible for the decision to sack Mr Comey, calling him a \"showboat\" and \"grandstander\".\n\nBut this appeared to undermine earlier comments from administration officials that Mr Comey had been fired on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein.\n\nThe first line of Mr Trump's letter sacking Mr Comey refers to a memo written by Mr Rosenstein and says: \"I have accepted their recommendation\".\n\nBut he later told NBC he was \"going to fire him regardless of the recommendation\".\n\nThe White House said Mr Comey was fired over his handling of the Hillary Clinton email affair, but Democrats have asked, if that is the case, why it took so long.\n\nDonald Trump was reportedly unhappy with how his press team handled fallout from Tuesday's decision to fire Mr Comey, so he's taken things into his own hands. Boy, has he.\n\nFirst he gave an interview that essentially undercut all the arguments White House officials, from Vice-President Mike Pence on down, had made to paint the Comey sacking as an operation conducted through normal channels. Now he has taken to Twitter in earnest, spraying a barrage of allegations, accusations and aggressions against Democrats, the media and Mr Comey himself.\n\nIn sports terms, the strategy could be described as \"flooding the zone\" - launching a ferocious, full-out assault to overwhelm an opponent's defences. In this case, Mr Trump has the media scrambling to decide which story merits the most coverage.\n\nIs it the details of the Comey-Trump dinner and the president's hints of secret \"tapes\"? His threat to cancel press briefings? The Oval Office visit by a Russian entourage? Perhaps, as Mr Trump suggests, the \"real news\" is the tentative trade agreement between the US and China on beef and poultry products?\n\nWhen everything is a big story, nothing is. At least, that's what Mr Trump may hope.\n\nThere is also a suggestion Mr Comey had asked for more resources for the FBI inquiry.\n\nThen there is a New York Times report this week which said that, during a one-on-one dinner in late January, Mr Trump had asked Mr Comey for a pledge of loyalty but it was not forthcoming.\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told MSNBC on Friday he had spoken to Mr Comey before the dinner, and the FBI head had said he was \"uneasy\" about it as it might compromise his inquiry.\n\nMr Spicer later said that the president had not asked for a pledge of loyalty.\n\nApparently angered by criticism of the different accounts of the sacking, Mr Trump used another of his tweets on Friday to say: \"As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!\"\n\nHe added: \"Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future 'press briefings' and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???\"\n\nMr Spicer said the president was a \"little dismayed\" that the attempts of his press team to give out information were being turned into a \"game of gotcha\" by the media.\n\nIt was unclear whether Mr Trump's reference to \"tapes\" suggested there might be secret recordings of conversations that could be used to challenge any statements by Mr Comey, or whether it was simply a way of warding him off from commenting.\n\nMr Spicer said he was not aware of any recording of the dinner with Mr Comey.\n\nThe reference to tapes has done nothing to silence the echoes of the Watergate affair that have resounded around the Russian interference inquiry.\n\nIn 1973, President Richard Nixon sacked Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor who was seeking access to tapes of presidential conversations that ultimately led to Mr Nixon's resignation.\n\nCNN cited an unnamed source as saying Mr Comey was \"not worried about any tapes\" Mr Trump may have of their conversations.\n\nMr Trump has dismissed the FBI investigation as a \"charade\" and has said Democrats are using \"fake news\" about collusion with the Russians as an excuse for losing the election.\n\nIn another tweet on Friday, Mr Trump said: \"When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?\"\n\nHowever, Mr Comey's successor, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, said on Thursday that it remained \"a highly significant investigation\".\n\nIn testimony to the Senate intelligence committee, he also cast doubt on White House claims that Mr Comey had lost the confidence of his staff.\n\n\"I can confidently tell you that the vast majority of employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,\" Mr McCabe said.\n\nSeparately on Friday, Mr Trump's lawyers said a review of the past 10 years of his tax returns showed \"no income of any type from Russian sources\". Although there was income from a beauty pageant and the sale of a property in Russia, there was \"no equity investment by Russians\" and no money owed by Russians to Mr Trump, a letter, printed here by the New York Times, said."],[5,"Donald Trump confirms US will quit Paris climate agreement","Donald Trump has confirmed that he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, in effect ensuring the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases will quit the international effort to address dangerous global warming.\n\nThe US will remove itself from the deal, joining Syria and Nicaragua as the only countries not party to the Paris agreement. There will be no penalty for leaving, with the Paris deal based upon the premise of voluntary emissions reductions by participating countries.\n\n“In order to fulfil my solemn duty to the United States and its citizens, the US will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accords or a really entirely new transaction, on terms that are fair to the United States,” the US president told press in the White House rose garden on Thursday.\n\n“We will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair,” Trump said. “If we can, that’s great. If we can’t, that’s fine.”\n\nBut Italy, France and Germany issued a joint statementshortly after Trump’s speech saying they believed the treaty could not be renegotiated.\n\nTrump told the crowd outside the White House: “The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries should expel any doubt as to why foreign lobbyists should wish to keep our beautiful country tied up and bound down … That’s not going to happen while I’m president, I’m sorry.”\n\nHe added: “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.”\n\nTrump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, issued a rare statement saying the new administration had joined “a small handful of nations that reject the future”. But he said that US states, cities and businesses “will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we’ve got”.\n\nFormer vice-president Al Gore called the move “reckless and indefensible”, while among the business leaders to express regret over the move was Jeff Immelt, chair and CEO of General Electric, who said “climate change is real” and “industry must now lead”.\n\nTrump, who spoke after being introduced by a warm-up band playing the George Gershwin classic Summertime, argued that the Paris agreement disadvantaged the US to the benefit of other countries, leaving workers and taxpayers to absorb the costs and suffer job losses and factory closures. As of today, he said, the US will cease implementation of the nationally determined contribution and green climate fund, “which is costing the US a vast fortune”.\n\nIn 2015, nearly 200 countries agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent the runaway climate change that would occur should temperatures spiral 2Cor more above the pre-industrial era.\n\nTrump’s decision risks destabilizing the Paris deal, with remaining participants faced with the choice of trying to make up the shortfall in emissions cuts or following the US’s lead and abandoning the agreement.\n\nThe US emissions reduction pledge accounts for a fifth of the global emissions to be avoided by 2030, with an analysis by not-for-profit group Climate Interactive showing that a regression to “business as usual” emissions by the US could warm the world by an additional 0.3C by 2100. This would help push the global temperature rise well beyond 2C, causing punishing heatwaves, sea level rise, displacement of millions of people and the loss of ecosystems such as coral reefs.\n\nThe US withdrawal would not, though, derail global efforts to fight climate change, said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who delivered the Paris agreement. “States, cities, corporations, investors have been moving in this direction for several years and the dropping prices of renewables versus high cost of health impacts from fossil fuels, guarantees the continuation of the transition.”\n\nThe US will be the loser from its withdrawal, said Prof John Schellnhuber, a climate scientist and former adviser to the EU, Angela Merkel and the pope. “It will not substantially hamper global climate progress but it will hurt the American economy and society alike,” he said. “China and Europe have become world leaders on the path towards green development already and will strengthen their position if the US slips back. The Washington people around Trump fail to recognise that the climate wars are over, while the race for sustainable prosperity is on.”\n\n“President Trump is putting his country on the wrong side of history,” said Laurence Tubiana, France’s climate ambassador during the negotiation of the Paris deal.\n\nJohn Kasich, the governor of Ohio and a frequent critic of Trump, said he shared concerns about “flaws” in the treaty. “I’m convinced we can correct them and improve the agreement, however,” he said, “by showing leadership and constructively engaging with like-minded nations, not by joining the ranks of holdouts like Syria and Nicaragua.”\n\nBernie Sanders, the leftwing senator and former Democratic presidential hopeful, called the move an “international disgrace” and an “abdication of American leadership”.\n\nBut House speaker Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress, threw his support behind Trump’s decision, saying the Paris accord was “simply a raw deal for America”.\n\n“In order to unleash the power of the American economy, our government must encourage production of American energy,” Ryan said in a statement. “I commend President Trump for fulfilling his commitment to the American people and withdrawing from this bad deal.”\n\nTrump followed through with his campaign pledge to “cancel” US involvement in the Paris accord following months of conflicting signals over whether he would do so or just scale back the US ambition to cut emissions.\n\nThe withdrawal represents a victory for the nationalist elements in Trump’s administration, such as his strategist Steve Bannon, who have argued the Paris deal undermines an “America first” approach, harms domestic coal production and hinders efforts to repeal Barack Obama-era regulations such as the Clean Power Plan. On Tuesday, Trump met with Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency head who has called Paris a “bad deal” that should be discarded.\n\nIn his speech, Trump sought to frame his decision as part of this nationalist agenda. “The Paris agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense,” he said. “They don’t put America first. I do, and I always will.”\n\nA group of 22 Republican senators, headed by majority leader Mitch McConnell, backed the anti-Paris view in a letter to Trump that urged a “clean exit” from the Paris deal, which they said added a “regulatory burden” upon the US.\n\nThe anti-agreement faction had jockeyed for Trump’s favour over a rival school of thought, including secretary of state Rex Tillerson and Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, that argued the US should remain in the Paris deal in order to preserve its diplomatic influence.\n\nHundreds of large businesses, including Apple, Google and Walmart, alsothrew their weight behind the deal, with even fossil fuel firms such as ExxonMobil, BP and Shell supporting the accord as the best way to transition to a low-carbon economy and stave off the perils of climate change.\n\nIn a bid to calm the frayed nerves of countries most at risk from rising temperatures, the EU and China announced an alliance to stay the course earlier on Wednesday. Their joint declaration called climate change a “national security issue” and a “multiplying factor of social and political fragility.” The Paris pact is a “historic achievement” and “irreversible”, the document says.\n\n“It is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris agreement,” said UN secretary general António Guterres. “If one country decides to leave a void, I can guarantee someone else will occupy it.”\n\nEnvironmental groups were scathing of Trump’s decision, with more than 20,000 members of the Sierra Club calling the White House within hours of reports that the president had opted to exit the deal. “Donald Trump has made a historic mistake which our grandchildren will look back on with stunned dismay at how a world leader could be so divorced from reality and morality,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club.\n\nBill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, said he will sign an order committing the city to the Paris deal due to the “destructive power” of disasters like Hurricane Sandy.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom McCarthy, David Smith and Sabrina Siddiqui"],[5,"Donald Trump attacks Democrats for key government vacancies despite failing to nominate candidates","President Donald Trump has lambasted Democrats for not approving his nominees, even though he has named few candidates to fill those executive branch positions.\n\nAs part of a Monday tweetstorm, the US leader complained that Senate Democrats “are taking forever to approve my people, including Ambassadors.”\n\n“They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS! Want approvals.”\n\nOf the 559 key positions that require Senate confirmation, only 63 – or 11 per cent – have been formally nominated. Of those nominees, 39 have been confirmed, according to the Washington Post and the nonpartisan group Partnership for Public Service.\n\nThe President has still not named candidates for dozens of ambassadorships. Currently, only five nominated candidates remain unconfirmed.\n\nMr Trump said he would nominate New York Jets owner Woody Johnson as ambassador to the UK but has not formally done so.\n\nMr Trump’s nominees that have been confirmed include David Friedman, the ambassador to Israel, and Terry Branstad, the ambassador to China.\n\nDuring the previous administration, President Barack Obama had formally nominated 219 candidates for executive branch positions by 20 May during the first year of his presidency. Almost 60 per cent of those were confirmed by the Senate by that time.\n\nHaving a high number of unfilled positions across federal agencies may not be a huge risk in the short term, as the administration can appoint acting individuals to fill those roles while political appointees await Senate confirmation, according to experts interviewed by Business Insider. However, the ability to enact long-term policies may be hampered if those positions continue to remain unoccupied by the President's nominees. "],[5,"Dershowitz Says Special Counsel Will Help Trump: 'He's Going to Find No Crime'","Although many on the left have expressed their approval of Robert Mueller being appointed as special counsel to investigate possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Alan Dershowitz thinks Mueller could actually vindicate President Donald Trump, rather than bring about his downfall.\n\nOn \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" Dershowitz, a legal scholar and Harvard University Law School professor, said he doesn't see a crime that necessitated the appointment of a special counsel.\n\nHe explained that it would not be criminal, even if it happened, for the Trump campaign to have collaborated with the Russians in an effort to get their candidate elected.\n\n\"That's political wrongdoing, but it's just not a crime,\" Dershowitz said. \"Nobody can point me to a statute that would be violated. And a prosecutor is only allowed to look for evidence of a federal crime.\"\n\nHe said that he predicts the end result will be Mueller announcing no evidence of a crime, which would obviously be beneficial to Trump.\n\nDershowitz said the worst-case scenario for the White House would be that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn gets indicted, but even if that were to happen, Trump could pardon him.\n\n\"It's going to be done in secret, behind closed doors, and all we get in the end is no indictment or a lower-level former official gets indicted,\" Dershowitz said. \"And I think in the end that helps the Trump administration, not hurts them.\"\n\nWatch more above."],[5,"Congress exasperated as White House in 'downward spiral'","(CNN)Republicans in Congress barely had time to get their footing Monday, as another wild development, this time reports that President Donald Trump had revealed sensitive intelligence to Russia's foreign minister and US ambassador, swept the Capitol.\n\nSenators mulled over the latest stunning news, first reported by The Washington Post , as they met inside the chamber.\n\nTennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker said the wave of negative stories related to Trump and intelligence meant the White House is in a \"downward spiral.\"\n\n\"They are in a downward spiral right now and have got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that's happening,\" Corker told reporters. \"You know the shame of it is there's a really good national security team in place, there's good productive things that are underway through them, and through others. But the chaos that is being created by the lack of discipline is creating an environment that I think — it creates a worrisome environment.\"\n\nEven some of who had been reluctant to criticize Trump said Monday's report raised questions that needed answers.\n\n\"We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation's secrets is paramount,\" said Doug Andres, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan. \"The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.\"\n\nRepublican Susan Collins, a Maine senator, put her party's apparent exasperation more concisely in a light-hearted aside comment to reporters. \"Can we have a crisis-free day? That's all I'm asking.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican leading one of four congressional probes into Russia's meddling in the US elections, said he was not sure yet if Trump had leaked any intelligence to the Russians -- noting that other stories have been inaccurate.\n\nBut he noted that he had a problem with Trump's tweet Friday, threatening to release possible tapes of conversations with Comey.\n\n\"I think it was inappropriate, I think if there is a tape we need to know about it. I don't think we can dodge that issue. I want to get back to doing the business of the country. North Korea is developing a missile that can hit the American homeland,\" Graham said. \"I want to help the President where I can, but tweets like that take us off in a ditch.\"\n\nLawmakers were largely caught off guard by Monday's development. Many Republican lawmakers said they had not seen details about the report and did not want to comment.\n\n\"If the report is true, it is very disturbing,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"Revealing classified information at this level is extremely dangerous and puts at risk the lives of Americans and those who gather intelligence for our country.\"\n\n\"Congress must be given a full briefing on the extent of the damage President Trump has done in compromising highly classified code-word intelligence to the Russians,\" the California Democrat said.\n\n\"This is really concerning that he doesn't understand that certain information you don't share with Russia. You just don't. Share. With. Russia,\" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat. \"Our only chance of keeping this country safe is good intelligence sources. And if he (Trump) thinks classified intelligence information is something you're supposed to brag about to Russia. I mean, this shows a complete lack of information about what classified information is and how important.\"\n\nAsked if Trump should still have access to sensitive intelligence if he leaks it to Russian officials, McCaskill said: \"He's president of the United States. That's the dilemma. He's going to be called upon to make decisions about how we fight our enemies, so you don't want to withhold information from the President of the United States."],[5,"People are saying Melania Trump's dad looks strangely familiar","It is said that we are attracted to people with similar features to our own, but this might take it one step too far.\n\nPeople on Twitter have finally discovered First Lady Melania Trump's father.\n\nViktor Knavs, was captured in an image bearing a striking resemblance to someone.\n\nHe and Amalija Knavs, Melania's mother, were photographed stepping off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland over the weekend.\n\nPeople on Twitter have been commenting he looks strikingly similar to her husband and President of the United States, Donald Trump\n\nWe think it's the suit and the red and white striped tie.\n\nYou can compare with the slider below.\n\nPredictably, the internet went rather wild with the discovery.\n\nThankfully, their hair isn't the same."],[5,"Why do we even have White House press briefings?","We seem to be on a slow road to ending the daily White House press briefing. There's no law requiring it. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has been doing briefings off-camera, audio only, or not doing them at all. President Donald Trump has suggested maybe he should be doing the briefings himself. Why not?\n\nThe press briefings of late have been really bad. Sean appears as though he is being tortured and then ends things after about 5 questions. But I STILL think that the daily press briefings are far more valuable than whatever else Trump would replace them with. There is value in an official White House representative answering (or not answering) every day questions from the media. We forget this but taxpayers pay for Sean's salary. And the president's. Holding them accountable for what they say and do (and don't) matters.\n\nBut it's not about the quality of the show -- and it does feel like a show. If Spicer is continually undercut by his boss to the point where the words coming out of his mouth have no credibility... if the President says -- and he has! -- that his spokespeople can't really speak for him because they don't have the latest information, I don't understand why it's worthwhile.\n\nSo, if we know there's a better than even chance that what the press secretary is saying doesn't actually represent the thoughts of the President, which are either evolving, unformed or contradictory, that's a baseline for inaccuracy for the next three and a half years.\n\nThey could start each briefing by saying, please enjoy these statements, some of which are going to end up not being true. You can spend the next day or so figuring out which ones.\n\nBut -- and I hate when people say this -- I think you might have to broaden out the aperture. As in, whether or not you think what Sean -- or his eventual replacement (no one keeps this job for an entire presidency!) -- is accurately reporting either facts or the president's own views, jettisoning the daily press briefing entirely sets a very dangerous precedent for future administrations.\n\nWe've already seen attempts -- begun under the second Bush administration but perfected by Obama -- to end-run the media via technology. President Obama was able to sell an entirely self-told narrative about himself and his presidency via Flickr, Twitter, You Tube and the like. The daily press briefing is one of the last ways that independent and neutral reporters can ask direct questions of the administration. If we give that up, I think we are on a slippery slope to sacrificing any sort of access to the president and his senior staff.\n\nI'd also add this. Miles Davis famously said about music: \"It's not the notes you play. It's the notes you don't play.\" I think the same holds true when it comes to this administration and the press briefing. That Sean said on Wednesday that he hadn't spoken to the president about his views on climate change -- on the same day it was reported Trump had made the decision to pull out of the Paris accords -- speaks to the fact that Spicer is on the outside looking in. That he refused to explain what Trump was doing tweeting \"covfefe\" at 12:06 am shows how bunkered in and twisted up this administration is.\n\nThe notes you don't play, the briefings you don't have. Look -- I realize it is somewhat ridiculous for a working journalist to say that some sort of access -- any access! -- is counterproductive at the White House, where access is already so limited.\n\nBut a circus briefing with few facts can feel like a diversion. I'm not sure that ending it now means we wouldn't have it -- or something like it -- in the future. I'm not of the opinion that the next President -- either in 2021 or 2025 -- will be in the model of Trump. But it's becoming clear that the only true statements are the ones the President tweets. The daily briefing should not exist in large part as a way for SNL writers to brainstorm material.\n\nI kid. I get that these daily briefings are an exercise in daily futility. But, like we tell our kids, sometimes the trying is more important than the accomplishing. As in, you learn something from the effort even if you are ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nAs for the idea that the next president won't follow Trump's lead, I think we have to agree to disagree. My experience in covering presidential politics is that one of the only things on which there is bipartisan agreement is in finding ways to either shut out the press entirely or limit our access to the president and his top people. If Trump opens Pandora's Box, I am not sure there will be much urgency from his successor to slam it shut."],[5,"On Power Play: ‘Everything is about Trump’","Sally Houser joins the Strategy Session panelists to discuss Trump, the support for Macron in the French election and Sajjan’s resignation demands.\n\nAired on CTV News on May 5, 2017\n\nNext Article Workplace Harassment Is Not A Partisan Issue"],[5,"Trump Told Russians That Firing ‘Nut Job’ Comey Eased Pressure From Investigation","“By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia’s actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia,” Mr. Spicer said. “The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified conversations.”\n\nThe day after firing Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump hosted Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, in the Oval Office, along with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak. The meeting ignited controversy this week when it was revealed that Mr. Trump had disclosed intelligence from an Israeli counterterrorism operation.\n\nA third government official briefed on the meeting defended the president, saying that Mr. Trump, whose discursive speaking style has hindered him in office, was using a negotiating tactic when he told Mr. Lavrov about the “pressure” he was under. The idea, the official suggested, was to create a sense of obligation with Russian officials and to coax concessions out of Mr. Lavrov — on Syria, Ukraine and other issues — by saying that Russian meddling in last year’s election had created enormous political problems for Mr. Trump.\n\nThe president has been adamant that the meddling did not alter the outcome of the presidential race, but it has become a political cudgel for his opponents.\n\nMany Democrats, and some Republicans, have said that the president may have tried to obstruct justice by firing Mr. Comey. The Justice Department’s newly appointed special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was given the authority to investigate not only potential collusion, but also related allegations, which would include obstruction of justice.\n\nRepresentative Elijah E. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat and a member of the House Oversight Committee, called on Republicans to subpoena White House documents related to the meeting.\n\nThe F.B.I.’s investigation has bedeviled the Trump administration, and the president personally. Mr. Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the inquiry in March, telling Congress that his agents were investigating Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the presidential election and whether anyone in the Trump campaign had assisted in the Russian efforts. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion and called the case a waste of money and time. Former officials have testified that they have so far seen no evidence of collusion.\n\nThe acting F.B.I. director, Andrew G. McCabe, has called the case “highly significant” but said there had been no effort by the White House to impede the inquiry.\n\nAt first, the White House said Mr. Trump had fired Mr. Comey based on the recommendation of the Justice Department, and because of Mr. Comey’s handling of the F.B.I. investigation into Hillary Clinton last year. Officials said the move had nothing to do with the Russia investigation.\n\nBut the president undercut that argument a day later, telling NBC News, “When I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.”\n\nThe Oval Office comment about Mr. Comey’s sanity echoed what Mr. Trump has said privately at other times. The Times reported the day after Mr. Comey was fired that the president had told aides there was “something wrong with” Mr. Comey.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia engaged in widespread computer hacking and propaganda intended to tip the election toward Mr. Trump. Against that backdrop, the president has faced repeated questions about his links to Russia. During his candidacy, Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman declared that “there was no communication” with foreign entities during the campaign.\n\nJournalists have since revealed several instances of undisclosed meetings between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russians, or contacts that the White House initially mischaracterized. Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, was forced to resign over misstatements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.\n\nIn the Oval Office on May 10, Mr. Trump joked that he seemed to be the only person who had not met Mr. Kislyak, according to the American official reading the document. And while Mr. Trump played down his personal concern about the fighting in Ukraine, according to the official, the president said American critics cared about the issue and asked the Russians to help resolve the dispute. Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine are clashing with the country’s military.\n\nThe meeting, Mr. Trump’s first face-to-face encounter with Russian officials since becoming president, has been a distraction from the beginning. While American reporters were prohibited from attending, the Russian news agency Tass distributed photographs of the meeting.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr. Lavrov dismissed questions about the investigation into Russian meddling in the election and said the matter had not come up in the Oval Office. “We spoke with President Trump about concrete things and did not touch on this bacchanalia,” he said.\n\nBehind closed doors, according to the document read by the official, Mr. Trump said that news stories about possible Russian collusion were fake, a comment he has repeatedly made in public. He told the Russians that his poll numbers remained strong and that Americans wanted the government to have a healthy relationship with Russia.\n\nAt one point, Mr. Trump jokingly asked whether there were reporters in the room.\n\n“No,” Mr. Lavrov said. “No fake media.”"],[5,"Feeling the heat: Reporters worry about aggressive leak investigations in Trump era","These are national security reporters describing the difficulties of the job -- communicating with anonymous sources and dealing with classified information. The reporters say it's especially tricky now that President Trump has publicly demanded the prosecution of people who leak government secrets.\n\n\"This is a tough operating environment. There is a chill for sure. We'll see how bad it gets,\" New York Times reporter Adam Goldman told CNN.\n\nOther reporters say Trump's crackdown has caused them to re-evaluate \"source protection\" and \"operational security.\"\n\nOn the one hand, there are a relatively high number of government employees who want to clandestinely help reporters right now. On the other hand, there's an aggressive government effort underway to root out those employees.\n\nOn Monday the Justice Department announced the first Espionage Act case of the Trump era, bringing charges against a woman who, according to prosecutors, sent a top-secret NSA document to The Intercept. The charges were announced one hour after The Intercept published its story about the document.\n\nExperts said the Obama administration would have likely brought the same case. Indeed, Obama's Justice Department was criticized for the high number of leak cases that it prosecuted -- it brought more Espionage Act-related charges against leakers than all previous administrations dating back to 1945, combined.\n\nThe difference now is Trump's words, and the chill they have created. Trump's loud public proclamations about his frustration with leaks have been heard clearly at various federal agencies, creating uncertainty and anxiety there and with the reporters who cover them.\n\n\"I think that the unknown for us, as national security reporters, is: What are they willing to do? How far are they willing to go outside the lines to clamp down on things they don't like?\" one beat reporter said on condition of anonymity.\n\nYes, some of the reporters insisted on anonymity, the same way their sources do. Why? Because the entire subject is so sensitive.\n\n\"With my sources, the fear is tangible,\" one of the reporters said.\n\nA government source confirmed to CNN that individual intelligence agencies have sent several referrals to the Justice Department for potential followup. The referrals were first reported by ABC News last week.\n\nReferrals about specific leaks of classified information open the door for a criminal investigation, but it is unclear how many such investigations are underway.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said the agency will not comment \"on the existence or non existence (or nature) of any investigations.\"\n\nThis means reporters and their sources are mostly in the dark. But four veteran Washington reporters told CNN that they sense -- based on what their sources are noticing at work -- that leak hunts are taking place.\n\n\"Everyone is feeling the heat,\" one said.\n\n\"People who talk to certain reporters have been approached for info about specific reporters,\" another said. \"The FBI has searched their employee phone records for contacts with reporters. Not surprising, I suppose. And that's the point of the leak probes, to scare people to not talk to reporters.\"\n\nStill, there have been an extraordinary number of leaks from the government, some about top-secret work and others about Trump administration infighting and incompetence.\n\nIt's typical for intelligence reporters to use \"burner\" phones, seek face-to-face meetings with sources and take other steps to protect sources. But they're being even more careful now.\n\n\"I am not gonna talk about it\" is all Goldman would say about tradecraft. He pointed out that Obama's Justice Department secretly obtained his phone records during a leak investigation in 2013.\n\nOne of the longtime reporters who spoke on condition of anonymity said he has perceived a White House effort to \"smoke out\" sources: \"We noticed that, after we came to the White House with a story they didn't like, they asked us to circle back to our sources before publication, to do a final fact-check. We don't know what their intentions were, but we were concerned that it was a trick -- to try to get us to light up the phone networks in the intel community.\"\n\nAnother national security reporter said the Obama administration was \"terrible\" in terms of prosecuting leakers, but noted, referring to certain guidelines the DOJ put together after being criticized for leak prosecutions, that \"there were certain 'rules,' certain legal pathways that they had to use.\"\n\nNow, with Trump, \"there is this kind of unknown. It's hard to know how far they'd go.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly tweeted that leakers of classified information should be found. And back in February, according to The New York Times, Trump told FBI director James Comey to consider imprisoning reporters who publish classified information. Trump fired Comey last month.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has, like Trump, been vocally critical of leaks and has pushed the FBI to prioritize leak investigations.\n\n\"It's very rattling as a reporter, but also very motivating as a reporter,\" one of the veteran journalists said."],[5,"Brian Burns withdraws as Trump’s nominee for Ambassador to Ireland","Brian F.

Burns Library at Boston College and as a senior official of the American Ireland Fund.\n\nThere will inevitably be speculation that the failure to appoint ambassadors by the Trump administration has played a role in the Burns decision.\n\nAs of the time of writing, scores of key positions have still not been filled by the Trump administration, including major ambassadorial appointments.\n\nBurns, a resident of Palm Beach, served as Trump’s lawyer when he first purchased Mar-a-Lago and the two become very close. He was a major supporter during the campaign and described the offer of being ambassador as one of the highlights of his life.\n\nThe position has now been vacant since former ambassador Kevin O’Malley stepped down the day of Trump’s inauguration in January.\n\nIrishCentral also understands Burns went through back surgery recently, which may have played a part in this decision.\n\nBurns, a son of Joe Kennedy’s closest political advisor and a leading Irish American philanthropist, was first revealed as Trump’s pick for Ambassador to Ireland by IrishCentral in early December.

He wasn’t joking.","French President Emmanuel Macron doesn’t kid around.\n\nLast week, the newly minted French leader delivered a bruising rebuke of Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris accord in a televised address. And in a jab at just how backward US climate politics have become, he invited American climate researchers to move to France.\n\nOn Thursday, he made that invitation official:\n\nDon’t be fooled by the cheeky slogan “Make Our Planet Great Again” and the snazzy graphic design — this is an actual policy and platform to recruit climate researchers. France, it boasts, has “top-level research infrastructure and laboratories as well as an effervescent startup ecosystem.”\n\nAmerican researchers fed up with the Trump administration’s rejection of the urgency of climate change can fill in a form detailing their vocation, nationality, and research interests. Then they get a customized pitch for why they ought to move to France.\n\nTo court other frustrated scientists, the site lists open positions in France, rules for eligibility, and available research grants of up to 1.5 million Euros. At the end of all that, eligible candidates are asked to upload one-page CVs and wait for responses, which are promised to come within a month.\n\nAnd it isn’t just scientists that Macron is looking to attract. Entrepreneurs, students, and even entire organizations are invited to apply, as long as they share an interest in climate action.\n\nThis underlines what my colleague Alex Ward said last week about this invitation as a strategic move. By encouraging American innovators, and now businesses and students, to move to France, Macron directly challenges Trump’s argument that pulling out of the Paris accord is in America’s economic interest. He’s also not hiding the fact that that he thinks he can lure top talent away.\n\nThe jury’s still out on whether American researchers will take him up on his offer, though there’s certainly some enthusiasm on social media:\n\nThis new recruitment effort is hardly the first time that Macron has stood up to Trump, or even to other world leaders.

High-ranking officials in the Justice Department unwilling to put loyalty to the president above their obligations to the country, and losing their jobs because of it.

And this morning, he attacked his deputy attorney general, Rod J.

Glad we cleared that up.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Watergate? Let’s go back to the Saturday Night Massacre. In October 1973, Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal, demanded that President Nixon turn over recordings of his Oval Office conversations. Nixon refused, and tried to negotiate a deal that Cox rejected. Nixon then ordered the attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to fire Cox. Richardson refused, and resigned. Nixon then ordered the deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus, to fire Cox. Ruckelshaus refused, and resigned. Nixon then ordered the next person in the Justice Department hierarchy, Solicitor General Robert Bork, to fire Cox. Bork agreed. While it would be 10 more months before Nixon himself resigned, the Saturday Night Massacre may have been the point where his determination to obstruct the Watergate investigation became the most clear to everyone in the country.\n\nWe aren’t there yet, but let’s take a good look at where we are. There is something serious going on between Trump and Rosenstein, who is overseeing the investigation of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, only Rosenstein has the authority to fire Mueller. And it’s plain that Trump would like to rid himself of this meddlesome special counsel; the question is whether he will try. Multiple reports from inside the White House paint a picture of Trump as obsessed with the investigation, railing against Mueller and considering whether to fire him — an act that everyone around Trump knows would be a political catastrophe (and possibly a legal one as well). Here’s just one small sample, from Politico:\n\nYesterday, Trump took to Twitter to launch an attack on Mueller:\n\nAnd then this morning he goes after Rosenstein, which requires understanding their brief but troubled relationship. By Trump’s own admission, he had already decided to fire FBI director James Comey when he ordered Rosenstein to prepare a report describing Comey’s alleged shortcomings. But when the firing happened, the White House initially claimed that Trump was only taking Rosenstein’s recommendation to fire Comey, in effect blaming Rosenstein for Trump’s decision. Rosenstein was reportedly so angry about it that he threatened to resign.\n\nHere’s the Daily Beast today, confirming how personal this has gotten for Trump:\n\nThen we get this report from ABC News:\n\nThe senior Justice Department official with ultimate authority over the special counsel’s probe of Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election has privately acknowledged to colleagues that he may have to recuse himself from the matter, which he took charge of only after Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ own recusal, sources tell ABC News. Those private remarks from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein are significant because they reflect the widening nature of the federal probe, which now includes a preliminary inquiry into whether President Donald Trump attempted to obstruct justice when he allegedly tried to curtail the probe and then fired James Comey as FBI director. Rosenstein, who authored an extensive and publicly-released memorandum recommending Comey’s firing, raised the possibility of his recusal during a recent meeting with Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand, the Justice Department’s new third-in-command, according to sources.\n\nIf Rosenstein is considering recusal, it’s because of his role in the Comey firing — which, let’s not forget, Trump admitted both on national television and in a conversation with Russian officials in the Oval Office that he did out of unhappiness with the Russia investigation. Rosenstein could become a witness in the obstruction investigation, which would make it problematic for him to be overseeing Mueller. The authority would then fall to Brand. Is Trump going to go after her next? What happens if he orders her to fire Mueller? Would she resign in protest like Richardson and Ruckelshaus, or follow orders like Bork?\n\nLet’s step back and try to grasp everything that’s going on here. The president of the United States is waging an inept public relations campaign against the special counsel’s investigation — not the particulars of it, because we know very little about the avenues Mueller is exploring and what he has discovered, but the very fact that he is being investigated at all. As he always does, Trump goes on the attack in personal ways. He seems to divide the world into those who are loyal to him on one hand and enemies on the other. James Comey’s fate may have been sealed when Trump asked him to pledge his loyalty and Comey refused (that is Comey’s account; the White House says it never happened).\n\nWhile Trump is erratic and impulsive much of the time, he seems particularly so with regard to this investigation. In some limited way it’s understandable — no president likes being investigated — but it seems to be pushing Trump to particular heights of irrationality. If you were trying to limit the investigation and its political fallout and not antagonize the prosecutors, it would be utterly insane to send out these kinds of tweets. Trump’s staff and lawyers are surely begging him to stop. But they can’t control him. There may be people who are willing to stand up to him and tell him that he’s making a mistake, but he’s obviously not willing to listen.\n\nIn an ordinary scandal, you have some initial set of misdeeds, and then possibly a coverup that adds more misdeeds that could themselves be criminal. In the Russia scandal we could have those two sets of actions, but on top of them we have a paranoid, infantile president seemingly determined to put himself in ever-greater political and legal jeopardy. The more we learn about how deep Mueller’s investigation is reaching, the higher the chances that Trump will, in a moment of rage, order Mueller to be fired. If you think things are dramatic and absurd right now, just wait — it’s going to get worse."],[5,"Robert Mueller expands special counsel office, hires 13 lawyers","(CNN)Special counsel Robert Mueller has brought 13 lawyers on board to handle the Russia investigation, with plans to hire more, according to his spokesman Peter Carr.\n\nMueller has assembled a high-powered team of top investigators and leading experts, including seasoned attorneys who've represented major American companies in court and who have worked on cases ranging from Watergate to the Enron fraud scandal.\n\nAmong them are James Quarles and Jeannie Rhee, both of whom Mueller brought over from his old firm, WilmerHale. He's also hired Andrew Weissmann, who led the Enron investigation.\n\n\"That is a great, great team of complete professionals, so let's let him do his job,\" former independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who investigated President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, told ABC News.\n\nWhile only five attorneys have been identified, concerns have come up over the political leanings of Quarles, Rhee and Weissmann. They have donated overwhelmingly to Democrats , totaling more than $53,000 since 1988, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Election Commission records.\n\nThe special counsel's investigators are looking into questions of Russian interference in last year's election, and plan to speak to senior intelligence officials, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nThe Post reported The Post reported that the interviews represent a widening of the probe to include looking into whether the President obstructed justice in suggesting to his former FBI Director James Comey that Comey drop the investigation into Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, as well as for his firing of Comey.\n\nMueller's investigators have asked for information and will talk to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, according to a source, who said they have also sought information from recently retired NSA Deputy Director Richard Ledgett. Coats and Rogers have testified that they were not pressured by the Trump administration.\n\nThe interviews are some of the first indications of the efforts of Mueller's newly assembled team.\n\nUltimately, it would be up to Mueller to decide whether there is enough evidence to recommend pursuing charges on any part of the investigation.\n\nLaw enforcement sources tell CNN that the special counsel is gathering information and considering whether there is evidence to launch a full-scale obstruction investigation.\n\nthe President tweeted \"They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice,\" the President tweeted\n\nIn another tweet, Trump called it \"the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history -- led by some very bad and conflicted people!\"\n\nA spokesman for the office of the special counsel declined to comment, and so did a representative for the director of National Intelligence. In a statement, the National Security Agency said it \"will fully cooperate with the special counsel,\" but declined to comment further.\n\nMark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump's outside attorney, Marc Kasowitz, slammed the Post's reporting. \"The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal,\" he said.\n\nRuddy, who had been at the White House on Monday, told PBS that Trump is considering terminating the special counsel."],[5,"Comey testimony: Trump could have had 'chilling effect' on Russia investigation – as it happened","Here’s Guardian columnist Richard Wolffe on the day’s events:\n\nJames Comey wants you to know a few things.

Third, that you really shouldn’t trash the reputation of James Comey and the FBI without expecting some payback.\n\nTrump’s Russian web may be a complicated contraption, but the firing of Comey is a much simpler matter.\n\nIn a devastating opening statement, delivered without notes, Comey explained how confused he was. After all, Trump had told him he was doing a great job and wanted him to stay. Then Trump fired him, either for the Russia investigation (as Trump said), or for the Clinton emails (as the Justice department said), or simply for bad management.\n\nIt was that last smack to the face that gave Comey all the motive he needed to go public. “Those were lies, plain and simple,” he told the senators and the world. “And I am so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them, and I’m so sorry that the American people were told them.”\n\nMore in sorrow and confusion, Comey proceeded to eviscerate his former boss.\n\nRead further:"],[5,"Programmer Pyotr Levashov reportedly suspected in US election hacking arrested","Madrid: A Russian computer programmer, Pyotr Levashov, has been arrested in the Spanish city of Barcelona, a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Madrid said on Sunday.\n\nIt was unclear why Levashov was arrested.

On May 25th, in a 900-word speech made in front of a monument to 9/11 at NATO’s new headquarters in Brussels, the president failed to mention the alliance’s Article 5—the bedrock commitment to regard an attack on one member country as an attack on all.\n\nThe assembled heads of government had expected to receive a dressing down on most member countries' failure to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. That they got. Many of them agree with Mr Trump on the need to do more and can point to European defence budgets that are have been rising, albeit too slowly, as a consequence of Russia’s aggression towards Ukraine. They will, however, have been irritated by Mr Trump’s repetition of the canard that the spending shortfall means that the money is somehow “owed” and that American taxpayers have been taken for a ride.\n\nIt would have been smart of Mr Trump to have encouraged their efforts on spending while taking some of the credit for getting them to sharpen up. If he had then made the Article 5 pledge, the trip would have been deemed a success.\n\nThe fact that he did neither of those things means that it was instead pretty disastrous. Having questioned the basis for Article 5 more than once during his campaign for the White House, NATO members—and crucially, the alliance’s Russian adversary—are left wondering whether if push came to shove America would still have their back.\n\nIt is all very well for other members of the administration, such as Jim Mattis, the defence secretary, and Mike Pence, the vice president, to say the right things. But it is Mr Trump who would have to make the call if Vladimir Putin was sufficiently emboldened to think it worth having a nibble at one of the Baltic states.\n\nTactfully, NATO had decided not to put Russia on the agenda of the mini-summit, concentrating instead on the thing Mr Trump cares most about: terrorism. But in other conversations, the Europeans were left quietly appalled by Mr Trump’s apparent insouciance about the Russian threat.\n\nThe general discomfort was reflected in the awful optics of the event. During a photo-call, none of the heads of government could bring themselves to speak to Mr Trump, preferring to huddle round Angela Merkel. Mr Putin must have loved every minute of it. "],[5,"Trump eager for big meeting with Putin; some advisers wary","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is eager to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin with full diplomatic bells and whistles when the two are in Germany for a multinational summit next month. But the idea is exposing deep divisions within the administration on the best way to approach Moscow in the midst of an ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. elections.\n\nMany administration officials believe the U.S. needs to maintain its distance from Russia at such a sensitive time — and interact only with great caution.\n\nBut Trump and some others within his administration have been pressing for a full bilateral meeting. He's calling for media access and all the typical protocol associated with such sessions, even as officials within the State Department and National Security Council urge more restraint, according to a current and a former administration official.\n\nSome advisers have recommended that the president instead do either a quick, informal \"pull-aside\" on the sidelines of the summit, or that the U.S. and Russian delegations hold \"strategic stability talks,\" which typically don't involve the presidents. The officials spoke anonymously to discuss private policy discussions.\n\nThe contrasting views underscore differing views within the administration on overall Russia policy, and Trump's eagerness to develop a working relationship with Russia despite the ongoing investigations.\n\nAsked about the AP report that Trump is eager for a full bilateral meeting, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday that \"the protocol side of it is secondary.\" The two leaders will be attending the same event in the same place at the same time, Peskov said, so \"in any case there will be a chance to meet.\" Peskov added, however, that no progress in hammering out the details of the meeting has been made yet.\n\nThere are potential benefits to a meeting with Putin. A face-to-face meeting can humanize the two sides and often removes some of the intrigue involved in impersonal, telephone communication. Trump — the ultimate dealmaker — has repeatedly suggested that he can replace the Obama-era damage in the U.S.-Russia relationship with a partnership, particularly on issues like the ongoing Syria conflict.\n\nThere are big risks, though. Trump is known to veer off-script, creating the possibility for a high-stakes diplomatic blunder. In a brief Oval Office meeting with top Russian diplomats last month, Trump revealed highly classified information about an Islamic State group threat to airlines that was relayed to him by Israel, according to a senior administration official. The White House defended the disclosures as \"wholly appropriate.\"\n\nIn addition, many observers warn that Putin is not to be trusted.\n\nOleg Kalugin, a former general with the main Soviet security agency, known as the KGB, said Putin, a shrewd and experienced politician, has \"other priorities\" than discussing the accusations that Russia hacked the U.S. election with Trump, such as easing sanctions, raising oil prices, as well as next year's presidential elections in Russia.\n\n\"Putin knows how to redirect a conversation in his favor,\" Kalugin said.\n\nNina Khrushcheva, a Russian affairs professor at the New School, said Trump is in an \"impossible position.\"\n\n\"He can't be too nice to Putin because it's going to be interpreted in a way that suggests he has a special relationship with Russia,\" she said. \"He can't be too mean because Putin has long arms and KGB thinking. So Trump needs to have a good relationship with him but he also needs to fulfill his campaign promises of establishing better relations with Russia.\"\n\nThe White House said no final decision has been made about whether a meeting will take place. It did not respond to questions about the opposing views within the administration.\n\nBilateral meetings are common during summits like the G20, where many world leaders and their advisers are gathered in one place. The meetings are typically highly choreographed affairs, with everything from the way the two leaders shake hands to the looks that they exchange and the actual words spoken offering glimpses into the state of affairs.\n\nThe last U.S.-Russia bilateral meeting was a 2015 encounter between Putin and President Barack Obama that began with an awkward handshake and ended with progress on the brutal civil war in Syria.\n\nThat 2015 meeting, the first in two years, involved a 90-minute sit-down at U.N. headquarters. Putin and U.S. officials later said the two leaders had made progress on issues related to Syria, which had strained their already tense relationship. For the Obama administration, cautious engagement was the name of the game, with the U.S. working tirelessly to find middle ground with Moscow on Syria, Ukraine and other issues.\n\nThe disconnect between Trump and his advisers in the State Department and National Security Council over Russia runs deeper than the debate over a G20 bilateral.\n\nA former administration official who spoke anonymously to discuss classified information said that frustration is growing among foreign policy advisers over the failure of the White House to embrace a more cautious and critical approach to Russia. All 17 U.S. intelligence agencies have agreed Russia was behind last year's hack of Democratic email systems and tried to influence the 2016 election to benefit Trump.\n\nTrump has to directly \"say to Putin, 'We're not happy about you interfering in our election,'\" said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. \"If you don't say that, you are going to get hammered by the press and Congress and you can guarantee Congress will pass sanctions legislation against Russia.\"\n\n\"They also need to keep their expectations very, very modest,\" added Pifer. \"If they aim for a homerun in Hamburg, my guess is they'll strike out.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report."],[5,"61 percent say Trump fired Comey to protect himself (POLL)","Six in 10 Americans think Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in order to protect himself rather than for the good of the country, and most think Trump is trying to interfere with official investigations of possible Russian influence in the 2016 election.\n\nA broad seven in 10 in an ABC News/Washington Post poll also doubt Trump’s word on the Russia issue. That said, 55 percent doubt Comey’s word as well -– likely a sign of his own past controversies, as well as general distrust of Washington.\n\nSee PDF for full results, charts and tables.\n\nWith Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee today and Comey himself to do so tomorrow, the survey finds the public taking a particularly dim view of Trump in the controversy. Sixty-one percent say he ditched the director to protect himself; just 27 percent think he did it for the good of the nation.\n\nFifty-six percent also think Trump is trying to interfere with investigations into possible Russian interference in the election, while just a third think he’s cooperating. And 72 percent report just some or no trust in what Trump says about the issue – half, none at all. Just 21 percent report a great deal or good amount of trust in what the president says about it.\n\nEven conservatives are about twice as apt to have low trust in what Trump says about Russian interference than to have substantial trust, 60-33 percent. And in the president’s own party, Republicans split evenly on the question of trust, 48 percent expressing distrust, 45 percent, trust.\n\nAs noted, there’s also skepticism of Comey in the poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates; 55 percent have just some or no trust in what he says about possible Russian interference. That said, distrust is 17 points lower than it is for Trump, and twice as many Americans have no trust whatsoever in what Trump says on the issue (50 percent) as have no trust at all in what Comey says (25 percent).\n\nDistrust of Trump is widespread; as noted, even 48 percent of Republicans express just some or no trust in what the president says about possible Russian influence in the election and related issues, as do 60 percent of conservatives, 65 percent of middle-aged and older adults, 68 percent of men and 71 percent of whites. These numbers are as high or higher in other groups.\n\nViews that Trump fired Comey to protect himself, and is trying to interfere in the investigation, peak among Democrats, liberals, younger adults, nonwhites and women. Adults age 18 to 39, for example, are 25 points more apt than their elders to think Trump fired Comey to protect himself and 21 points more likely to doubt what the president says about possible Russian interference. Nonwhites are 20 points more likely than whites to think Trump is interfering in the investigations. Women think so more than men by 12 points.\n\nParty lines are sharp: Eighty-eight percent of Democrats and nearly two-thirds of independents think Trump fired Comey to protect himself; 71 percent of Republicans think it was for the country’s good. And Democrats overwhelmingly think Trump is interfering with the investigation, 87-10 percent; that virtually flips among Republicans, with 77 percent saying he’s cooperating. Independents are about twice as likely to think Trump is interfering rather than cooperating.\n\nSimilarly, a steep majority of liberals (86 percent) think Trump was protecting himself in firing Comey, as do 66 percent of moderates; that declines to 38 percent of conservatives. A narrow majority of conservatives, 52 percent, think Trump’s decision was for the good of the country.\n\nViews of Comey also are partisan, but less overwhelmingly so. Fifty-four percent of Democrats trust what he says on the Russia issue, declining to 32 percent of independents and 18 percent of Republicans; it’s 60-37-16 percent from liberals to moderates to conservatives. There’s a larger division by race on Comey than on Trump, with whites 11 points more likely than nonwhites to distrust Comey.\n\nThese results set the stage for Comey’s highly anticipated testimony Thursday: Most Americans approach what he has to say with considerable skepticism. Yet far more express deep doubts about what the president says -– and about what he’s done –- in the ongoing Russia controversy.\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone June 2-4, 2017, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 527 adults.

A record number of Jewish and Muslim centers have been attacked in the first year of the Trump presidency. Across the US white supremacists and neo-Nazi’s feel emboldened to march with their Nazi flags while chanting anti-Semitic anti-Muslim hate in a throw back to the dark days of segregation.\n\nBut here in Britain we must not be complacent about the rising levels of open bigotry on display in our own country.\n\nTrump and Brexit have emboldened racism and racists and mainstreamed bigotry and hate in ways we have not seen for decades. Much of our public and political discourse post-Brexit has been used as a tool for stoking hate and fanning the flames of bigotry. Immigrants, refugees, Muslims, Jews, gays, trans and lesbian women continue to be the targets of this hatred. According to Home Office figures, in the past year, reported hate crime has spiked by 29 per cent..\n\nIn Europe openly neo-Nazi and racist parties are on the march – not only on the streets but in national parliaments, propelled by a toxic mix of public debate which blames the crisis of neo-liberalism and inequality on the “other”.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the organisers of the national Stop Trump campaign are mobilising thousands of people for what is set to be one of the UK's largest and most vocal protest when Trump arrives in London to visit the new US embassy in February.\n\nThis will be a moment for us to not only protest against Trumpism but show support and solidarity with anti-racist movements, refugee and migrant action groups, women’s rights organisations, intersectional feminists, anti-poverty activists and climate change campaigners. To unite under a common vision of an open, progressive society where we the people will resist, loud and proud against both Trump and own government’s demonising and scapegoating of the marginalised and minority communities.\n\nTrump, our own Prime Minister Theresa May and all those who seek to build walls and fences between us should expect a carnival of resistance on the streets of London and beyond.

Already 1 in 10 people say they are likely to protest Trump and his politics when he visits.

JFK was of course murdered by Ted Cruz’s father.”\n\nReports have also suggested that Trump told Russian diplomats that he fired Comey so that his investigation into his Russian ties would ease off. Oliver called him “audaciously corrupt” and said that it’s like if Hillary Clinton had sent an email with the subject line: “Sup I did Benghazi.”\n\nThe Washington Post has claimed that a significant person within the White House is being looked into as part of the Russian investigation. “Some have suggested that could be Jared Kushner, but that seems unlikely because while he is technically significant and legally a person, he in no way qualifies as ‘of interest’,” he said. “He is the least interesting person on Earth.”\n\nOliver then showed how Fox News has reported the last week, refusing to validate any of the scandalous information – but within just two days, one of them broke and started to show concerns. “A Fox host not being able to hold his doubts at bay for 48 hours is pretty much a canary in a coal mine, but then at this point Donald Trump is basically waist deep in canaries,” he said.\n\nHe then speculated about what a Trump impeachment would look like, saying: “At least part of it would include thousands of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey.”\n\nOliver remarked on Trump’s ability to recover from a number of disasters. “It seems like with President Trump that he’s always approaching the end of the line but it never seems to come, as if for him, and him alone, the end of the line is drawn by MC fucking Escher,” he said.\n\nBut Oliver did admit that he doesn’t think Trump is happy either, and looked at a recent interview where the president bemoaned that his new life is harder than he expected. “Your old job was basically having a name, letting other people pay you to use that name and firing Dee Snider,” he said. “It was fucking easy.”\n\nIn his final Watergate comparison, he joked: “Say what you want about Nixon, but at least he wanted the fucking job.”"],[5,"Trump won't go to the UK because Brits don't like him","Downing Street repeatedly refused to confirm today that Donald Trump's State Visit will go ahead this Autumn -

but the London Mayor hit back and said the remarks were taken out of context.\n\nMr Khan said he was talking about the increased police presence on London streets, not the attacks themselves.\n\nBut Trump continued his attack, saying Khan had to 'think fast' to come up with his 'pathetic excuse' of a response.\n\nThe response from the British public was strong, with UK politicians and even Harry Potter author JK Rowling criticising the President on social media.\n\nGreen Party leader Caroline Lucas joined jibes at Mr Trump in the wake of the apparent postponement. \n\nComparing the situation to Mrs May's decision to shun TV debates during the election campaign, she tweeted: 'Looks like there's another leader who's too scared to show up.'\n\nMay was the first foreign leader to visit Trump in the White House when she made an appearance in Washington DC just seven days after his inauguration.\n\nShe extended a formal invitation from Queen Elizabeth II to Trump during that visit, and told the press she was 'delighted that the President has accepted that invitation'. \n\nSome of May's advisors had told her that the offer was premature and should have been 'put back a bit' in the wake of his controversial Muslim travel ban, but could not be rescinded once made.\n\nTrump's relationship with the British public has been highly strained for years - particularly in Scotland, where his golf developments have upset locals. \n\nLast week Theresa May told Trump she was 'disappointed' at his decision to take the US out of the Paris climate change agreement, although she did not join other European leaders in signing a joint statement condemning the action.\n\nHis presidency and potential state visit sparked mass protests in London in February when he was accused of racism over his travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, introduced in late January.\n\nIn the same month a petition calling for the President to be 'barred from the UK' signed by more than 312,000 was delivered to Parliament, triggering a debate on whether Trump should be allowed to enter the country.\n\nThe petition read in part: 'Donald Trump’s well-documented misogyny and vulgarity disqualifies him from being received by the Queen or the Prince of Wales. \n\n'Therefore during the term of his presidency Donald Trump should not be invited to the United Kingdom for an official state visit.'\n\nAnti-Trump protesters gathered outside the parliament building calling for him to be banned, while inside politicians likened him to a 'petulant child' - though both May and her supporters were adamant that a visit should go ahead.\n\nThe animosity felt towards Trump by the British people is likely to be a thorn in the president's side. \n\nAn Anglophile who has long boasted of his British heritage - his mother, Mary-Anne Trump, was born in Tong, Scotland - Trump longs for acceptance from the country.\n\nAt the start of the year he sent the UK government a list of demands for his then-expected visit.\n\nThey included having the Queen join him for a game of golf on the nine-hole course at her castle in Balmoral, Scotland, The Telegraph reported.\n\nHis PR team had hoped to replicate a photograph similar to the 1982 image of Ronald Reagan and the Queen riding horses together.\n\nHe also wanted dinner at Blenheim Palace - Winston Churchill's birthplace - in Oxfordshire, England, and tea at Buckingham Palace in London, according to The Express.\n\nTrump is not the only US president to face opposition from the British public; in 2003, George W Bush faced thousands of protesters angry at the then-recent invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nBetween 100,000 and 200,000 people descended on London to protest while he was in the capital, culminating in the toppling of a statue of Bush in Trafalgar Square. \n\nHis visit went ahead anyway. "],[5,"Congress Needs to Change Its Trump-Russia Investigation","Our first reality TV president, Donald Trump, must be boiling with envy over James Comey’s blockbuster testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee last week. The former FBI director, while shying away from legal conclusions, meticulously laid out facts that lead to one inescapable conclusion: The President’s official reasons for firing him were little more than a ginned-up justification for putting a wrench into the FBI’s investigation of ties between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller will surely be looking into whether the dismissal rises to the level of obstruction of justice or whether other crimes were committed. But congressional inquiries serve a bigger role in our system, including pinpointing and addressing problems, educating the American people and identifying wrongdoing that may not rise to the level of a crime. Comey himself described the committee’s probe as “a model” of “a functioning democracy” and urged its members to “keep doing what you’re doing.” Congress’s jurisdiction is also much broader than that of the special counsel. The Senate Intelligence Committee, for example, is looking into “active measures” directed by Russia against the U.S. political process and voting infrastructure — efforts that, in Comey’s words, “tried to shape the way we think, we vote, we act.” These types of incursions are not going to end: As both Comey and other intelligence officials have made clear, the Russians “will be back” in coming elections.\n\nFortunately, Congress — which has by and large welcomed Mueller’s investigation — has thus far seemed willing to play its role. The Senate Intelligence Committee has been the most active, holding high-profile hearings, beginning to conduct interviews and issuing document requests.\n\nBut it can do more, and it can do better. A recent Brennan Center report on the Trump-Russia investigations draws upon the lessons of past congressional investigations to highlight the conditions necessary for the Senate Intelligence Committee’s effort to be successful.\n\nFirst, even the midst of a highly charged political atmosphere, the committee must strive for bipartisanship. A Benghazi-style committee, set up to destroy a political opponent, is not the model. Rather, Congress needs to reach further back in history to examples such as the 1970s Church Committee and Watergate Committee. Despite some early missteps from the intelligence committee’s chairman, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), it appears that the committee is making significant efforts in this direction. Burr and his vice-chair, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), held a press conference to jointly declare their commitment to bipartisanship. The committee also granted them the authority to jointly issue subpoenas, which means that one political party will not control what information is sought, unlike the arrangement in the House intelligence committee.\n\nSecond, the committee should clarify that the scope of its investigation includes exploring the President’s links to private entities through which the Russian government operates — a particular concern in light of the Trump family’s extensive business interests in the country. It should also tell the American people how long it anticipates the investigation to continue and commit to issuing a public report. This is especially important because while the special counsel’s report will be provided to the Justice Department and Congress, it will not necessarily be released. The American people deserve to know the truth about issues so fundamental to our democracy and security.\n\nFinally, congressional leadership must urgently ramp up the resources available to the Senate Intelligence Committee. The committee is woefully understaffed to undertake a complex investigation of this sort and still contend with its regular workload. Public reports suggest the committee now has nine staffers who are assigned to the investigation (in comparison to the 46 staff for Benghazi and the 133 employed by the Church Committee).\n\nThe committee will likely need to grant immunity to least some witnesses in order to obtain information necessary for its work. In previous parallel investigations — most prominently Iran-Contra — congressional grants of immunity to witnesses undermined successful criminal prosecutions being brought by the Justice Department or independent counsel. The committee and special counsel can manage these potential conflicts. Comey, for one, testified that he had “no doubt” the committee could work in parallel with the special counsel. Indeed, his own appearance before the committee was cleared by the special counsel, and the committee heard this week from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who himself may end up a target in the investigations.\n\nThe work being carried out by the Senate Intelligence Committee and other congressional committees is a necessary counterpart to the special counsel’s criminal investigation. The committees are aimed at carrying out their congressional oversight duties and, where necessary, checking the executive branch; the special counsel’s inquiry is aimed at bringing to justice those who might have committed crimes. American democracy will be best served by their twin efforts."],[5,"Donald Trump Finally Gets His Wish, Is Now Under Criminal Investigation – Mother Jones","James Comey told President Trump three times that he wasn’t personally under investigation. That wasn’t enough. Trump didn’t want his friends under investigation either, so he fired Comey when the investigation continued. Can you guess what happened next?\n\nThe special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said. ….The obstruction-of-justice investigation of the president began days after Comey was fired on May 9, according to people familiar with the matter. Mueller’s office has now taken up that work, and the preliminary interviews scheduled with intelligence officials indicate his team is actively pursuing potential witnesses inside and outside the government.\n\nThat’s from the Washington Post. Trump’s fans, of course, continue to believe that the big scandal isn’t Trump’s likely obstruction of justice, but the fact that this stuff has been leaked. It’s the Deep State at work. After all, nothing ever leaked in Washington DC until Trump took office.

That’s what it’s all about. Success,” he tells his audience. “It’s going to happen to you.” In one advertisement promoting free seminars for the school, Trump guaranteed results. “In just 90 minutes, my hand-picked instructors will share my techniques, which took my entire career to develop. Then, just copy exactly what I’ve done and get rich,” he said.\n\nLeaning on an image of wealth and expertise—drawn less from reality than from reality television—Trump promised an easy path to prosperity, and people believed him. At least 5,000 people bought into Trump University, paying as much as $35,000 each to participate in live seminars and mentorship programs. These students bought in expecting they would learn Trump’s real estate investment skills, and receive special financing and close mentoring that would help them recoup the cost of their training and then some.\n\nTrump didn’t just fail to deliver; the entire thing was a scam. Far from “hand-picked,” his instructors had little knowledge of real estate. Many customers would later allege that they paid for services never received. Finally, he pushed his employees to target the elderly and uneducated, pushing vulnerable people to take on thousands of dollars in debt and exploiting their hope for a better life to line his pockets. Ultimately, the law caught Trump, forcing him to pay a $25 million settlement for this fraud.\n\nTrump University was an exercise in cruelty and predation. It is also a useful episode for thinking about President Trump’s $4.1 trillion budget proposal, released on Tuesday. Like all presidential budgets, this document isn’t a forecast. Congress still holds the power of the purse—and lawmakers have already declared it “dead on arrival” Still, it’s a statement of purpose—a glimpse into the values of the administration and a guide to its vision of the good.\n\nIf you followed Trump’s presidential campaign, you might assume that his budget would reflect his promise to put “America first,” with a focus on ordinary people and their needs. Indeed, along with attacks on Muslims and immigrants, Trump made specific promises: That he would provide cheaper, more comprehensive health care; that he would protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; that he would raise wages and provide new jobs. People believed him, and millions backed his campaign, confident that he would steer government for their benefit.\n\nThis was a scam too. There is no relief coming. No help with health care or jobs. Instead, if Trump and his team could govern by fiat, they would siphon trillions of dollars from the federal government to fill the coffers of the wealthiest people in the country, breaking his promises and immiserating millions of low-income and working Americans of all political stripes.\n\nPresident Trump’s budget includes roughly $2.5 trillion in cuts to anti-poverty programs, spaced out over a 10-year period. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program—otherwise known as “food stamps”—loses $191 billion. Between the Republican health plan—included in the proposal—and a set of additional cuts that reduce eligibility and shrink year-over-year funding, Medicaid loses nearly $1.5 trillion, or just more than 47 percent of its budget over the next decade, an unfathomable blow to low-income families, children, and the elderly.\n\nThe earned income tax credit and child tax credit—which provide needed relief to millions of working families—lose $40.4 billion. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, “welfare,” loses $21.6 billion, further slashing an already stingy and tough-minded program. Disability insurance and Supplemental Security Income, two key parts of Social Security that provide assistance to poor seniors and people with disabilities, lose $72 billion. On top of all of this, Trump’s budget makes substantial cuts to job-training programs, rental assistance, heating assistance for the elderly, education, and projects at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as funding for rural health and substance-abuse programs. It doesn’t just slash the social safety net; it douses it in fuel and sets it ablaze.\n\nAlthough it bears his name, Trump’s budget is the brainchild of Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Prior to his service in the administration, Mulvaney was a congressman, representing the 5 District of South Carolina and leading the House Freedom Caucus, which he co-founded. More than anything else, this proposal reflects the cruel, Ayn Randian ideology that animates the Freedom Caucus and the larger Tea Party movement. To use the language of a somewhat younger Paul Ryan, it takes from “takers” and gives to “makers,” a fact Mulvaney neither hides nor shies away from.\n\n“This is, I think, the first time in a long time that an administration has written a budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the taxes,” he said. Mulvaney added that while government should have “compassion” for the less fortunate, it should “also … have compassion for folks who are paying [for] it.”\n\nEvery working American contributes to the federal government, whether through payroll taxes or income taxes. But Trump and Mulvaney’s plan is to relieve the wealthy of their share. Next to the cuts, the centerpiece of this budget is a $3 trillion to $7 trillion tax cut for the richest Americans that lowers the individual rate, repeals taxes on investment income, ends the alternative minimum tax—which limits the deductions wealthy people can take—and slashes corporate taxes, as well as creating a massive new loophole for wealthy owners of partnerships and “sole proprietorships,” like incidentally, Donald Trump.\n\nMillions of Americans cast their ballots in November thinking they’d get the best possible “deal” from a hard-charging president who cares about people like them. What they will receive—or at least, what he wants to offer—is highway robbery. He will pick their pockets to give benefits to his wealthy backers. It is shocking, but it’s not a surprise. This is who Trump was when he ripped off his contractors; it was who he was when sold a scam university to hopeful, desperate people; and it is who he is as president of the United States. Unfortunately, we now have to live with it."],[5,"George Soros, Trump nemesis, is Jared Kushner business partner.","Billionaire investor and liberal donor George Soros is the subject of many discredited right-wing conspiracy theories—so many that debunking site Snopes.com has an entire wing of Soros articles.

Only China and India can save us now","Earlier this year Donald Trump received a personal letter urging him not to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nIf the US pulled out, the letter said, it would lose a seat at discussions and could not make a case for “the most cost-effective greenhouse gas reduction options”.\n\nAnother voice in his ear said the US would weaken its own hand by “basically uninviting itself” from a number of negotiating tables.\n\nThose urging Mr Trump to stick with the agreement made by Barack Obama were not long-haired greenies or earnest activists. Rather, they were the chief executives of ExxonMobil, the world’s largest listed oil company, and Royal Dutch Shell. For they see the danger of the world’s most powerful nation not being present. Trump, apparently does not.\n\nDuring his election campaign, the Republican candidate dismissed climate change science as a “hoax” and suggested it had been invented by the Chinese.\n\nHaving got it in the ear last week from G7 leaders urging him to stick with the accord, Trump’s aides said his thinking on the topic was evolving. Then once he was back in Washington, it was reported Trump had told three associates he planned to pull out of the agreement after all. \n\nTrump believes sticking with Obama’s emissions targets will hurt business; climate experts say the implications of Trump’s decision are of an existential scale. \n\nThe Associated Press recently spoke to two dozen climate scientists and consulted a computer model designed to predict the potential impact of climate change. It found that Trump’s move would make a bad situation markedly worse and make it harder to stop the world crossing a perilous global temperature threshold.\n\nThe calculations suggested it would result in the release of an additional three billion tons of carbon dioxide every year, melting ice sheets more quickly, raising sea levels and triggering more extreme weather. \n\n“If we lag, the noose tightens,” said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer.\n\nIn another development, Trump’s rejection of the Paris Agreement would cede the US’s lead on confronting climate change to other nations, most notably China and India. \n\nFor many years, the world’s two most populous countries were seen as a block to progress on any global deal, insisting that developing nations should not be held to the same rules as countries in the West which, which had for decades benefited from CO2-emitting industrialisation.\n\nBut things have changed. China, which along with the US produces 44 per cent of the world’s carbon dioxide, agreed to talks with Obama that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Obama said the US would cut emissions immediately, with a target of 28 per cent by 2025, while Xi Jinping said China would seek to ensure its emissions peaked by 2030 and then fell.\n\nSince then China has stepped up its game. Earlier this year, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Xi said the Paris accord was hard-won. “All signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations,” he said.\n\nIndia, the world’s third largest overall producer of carbon dioxide – though not per capita – has also made striking progress. The nation expects to get 40 per cent of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2022, eight years ahead of schedule.\n\nIndeed, according to data released recently at a UN climate meeting in Germany, China and India should both easily exceed the targets they set for themselves in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\n“Five years ago, the idea of either China or India stopping – or even slowing – coal use was considered an insurmountable hurdle, as coal-fired power plants were thought by many to be necessary to satisfy the energy demands of these countries,” said Bill Hare, of climate science not-for-profit Climate Analytics. “Recent observations show they are now on the way toward overcoming this challenge.”\n\nEuropean leaders were little short of furious with Trump over his climate change stubbornness. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said discussions “had been very difficult, and not to say very unsatisfactory”. \n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron felt the need to underscore the severity of the situation by shaking Trump’s hand with such intensity that his knuckles went white. He later said it was “a moment of truth” designed to show that he was not a pushover.\n\nNone of this appears to have mattered to Trump. He seems set to pull the US out of an agreement most others nations consider essential to the planet’s survival.\n\nThe best hope may now lie with the very people Trump once mocked as hoaxers. "],[5,"Obstruction? Trump Asked Security Chiefs To Squelch Collusion Probe","After failing in his efforts to deter then-FBI Director James Comey from dropping the investigation into possible collusion with Russia, Trump shopped around for someone else in the national security leadership structure to put the brakes on the investigation, according to a report by the Washington Post.\n\nTo that end, the report claims that Trump made separate appeals to the director of national intelligence, Daniel Coats, and to Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, urging them to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion during the 2016 election.\n\nFortunately for the country, both declined, deeming the requests to be inappropriate.\n\nThe conversation with Rogers was documented in a contemporaneous memo, but it's unclear whether a similar memo exists with respect to Coats. The conversations occurred immediately after James Comey testified before Congress on March 20th that an investigation into possible collusion did indeed exist.\n\nHere's the kicker: They declined to cede to Trump's request because to do so would have been false.\n\nCurrent and former senior intelligence officials viewed Trump’s requests as an attempt by the president to tarnish the credibility of the agency leading the Russia investigation. A senior intelligence official said that Trump’s goal was to “muddy the waters” about the scope of the FBI probe at a time when Democrats were ramping up their calls for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, a step announced last week. Senior intelligence officials also saw the March requests as a threat to the independence of U.S. spy agencies, which are supposed to remain insulated from partisan issues. “The problem wasn’t so much asking them to issue statements, it was asking them to issue false statements about an ongoing investigation,” a former senior intelligence official said of the request to Coats.\n\nBasically CEO Trump ordered lifelong public servants to fix the PR mess, to lie, cheat and steal in order to do so, because it was a thorn in his side.

White House does not know yet","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House officials said on Friday they did not know yet whether President Donald Trump would seek to block former FBI Director James Comey from testifying to Congress next week, a move that could spark a political backlash.\n\n“I have not spoken to counsel yet. I don’t know how they’re going to respond,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters.\n\nComey was leading a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into alleged Russian meddling in last year’s U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump’s campaign when the president fired him last month.\n\nCritics have charged that Trump was seeking to hinder the FBI’s investigation by dismissing Comey.\n\nThe former FBI chief is due to testify on Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of its own Russia-related investigation, and his remarks could cause problems for the Republican president.\n\nComey is widely expected to be asked about conversations in which the president reportedly pressured him to drop an investigation into Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, whose ties to Russia are under scrutiny. Critics have said that such pressure could potentially amount to obstruction of justice.\n\nPresidents can assert executive privilege to prevent government employees from sharing information. However, legal experts say it is not clear whether certain conversations between Trump and Comey that the president has talked about publicly would be covered, and any effort to block Comey, who is now a private citizen, from testifying could be challenged in court.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers sent White House counsel Donald McGahn a letter warning that invoking executive privilege “would be seen as an effort to obstruct the truth from both Congress and the American people.”\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway appeared to indicate the president would allow Comey to testify. “We’ll be watching with the rest of the world when Director Comey testifies,” she said.\n\nBut asked directly whether Trump would invoke executive privilege on Comey’s testimony, she added: “The president will make that decision.”\n\nAmid a political firestorm touched off by Comey’s firing, the Justice Department appointed a special counsel last month to take the lead on the Russia investigation.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded the Russian government sought to influence the U.S. election in Trump’s favor, a charge Russia has denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, said on Thursday some Russians may have acted on their own.\n\nTrump, who has raised doubts about the U.S. agencies’ findings and denounced the continuing Russia probes, has denied any collusion."],[5,"Comey says Pence was aware of Flynn problems as early as the transition, which means Pence lied","Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) just pulled Vice President Mike Pence into the heart of the Russia investigation, asking former FBI Director James Comey whether Pence was aware of the concerns about Mike Flynn's Russia connections both prior to and during his brief tenure in the administration—that is during the transition. Which Mike Pence directed.\n\nComey: \"My understanding is that he was.\"\n\nThat undermines Pence's claim that he was totally ignorant of Pence's Russia ties and that Flynn had lied to him about it. That supposed lie, remember, was the justification Trump gave for firing Flynn."],[5,"Comey testimony reveals Trump is running America like a crime boss","Sarah Kendzior is a St. Louis, Mo.-based commentator who writes about politics, the economy and media.\n\nIn May, Americans learned that under its new seemingly autocratic administration, the subject of an investigation can fire the investigator. One month later, that fired investigator, former FBI head James Comey, appeared before the hearing to describe an executive branch that operates less like a democratic institution and more like a cross between a Mafia shakedown and an audition for The Apprentice. Transparency, checks and balances, and due process have been replaced by secret dinners, loyalty oaths and casual declarations of obstruction of justice.\n\nFortunately, James Comey took notes.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Comey released a copy of his opening statement describing his private meetings with President Donald Trump, culled from memos he wrote immediately after their encounters. They would make a great crime novel, if the crime weren't the desecration of democracy and we didn't have to live in it.\n\nAccording to Thursday's testimony, Mr. Trump – like a Mafia don – demanded unquestioning loyalty from Mr. Comey. And like a good public servant, Mr. Comey said he could only offer honesty. The President bargained that down to \"honest loyalty,\" which can be interpreted as a demand that Mr. Comey sacrifice his professional integrity for blind devotion to Mr. Trump. \"We had that thing you know,\" the President said, a phrase the former FBI director claimed he did not understand but which evokes Cosa Nostra a bit too well.\n\nThen, of course, Mr. Trump fired him.\n\nSince taking office, the President has run the U.S. more and more like a kleptocracy – a predictable move given his shady international ties and the corrupt nature of many of his past business ventures. But while Mr. Trump evokes foreign autocrats, his management style resembles that of an American mafioso. He views NATO as akin to a protection racket, public officials as personal minions, and the GOP as bound to a vow of Omerta. Refuse to comply, like Mr. Comey did, and face consequences.\n\nHis hearing was an important alternative to the obfuscation and propaganda of the Trump administration. Unlike most U.S. pundits and politicians, Mr. Comey called a lie a lie. He noted that for the first time in his tenure, he felt obligated to document his meetings with the President because he assumed that the President may be dishonest about their encounter. He said he needed his own records to defend not only himself, but the FBI.\n\nThis is a horrifying revelation on several levels. Mr. Comey confirmed that the President could not be trusted to look out for anyone's interest but his own, and that threats to national sovereignty were of lesser concern to him than whether he and his cronies are implicated. In other words, the person tasked with protecting the American people is a person from whom the American people need to be protected. Mr. Comey strongly affirmed that the U.S. had been attacked by Russia, and gave no indication that in their interactions, Mr. Trump found this situation undesirable.\n\nMr. Comey kept a diary as democracy was dying – his own job among its casualties. By recording the meetings as they occurred, Mr. Comey's records are legally admissible, bypassing the hearsay rule. But will his efforts matter? The hearings gave no indication that the GOP is willing to act on the evidence not only of collusion, but of flagrant obstruction of justice.\n\nRepublicans who once called for a non-partisan investigation of Russian interference now seem frightened into complicity. Former staunch Kremlin critic Marco Rubio – who had dinner with President Trump a few days ago, seemingly with a side order of a loyalty oath – treated Mr. Comey like a hostile witness. John McCain, who initially led the investigation charge, was barely coherent, confusing Mr. Comey with Mr. Trump and implying Hillary Clinton's e-mails were somehow behind it all.\n\nMr. Comey's firing showed how casually the Trump administration will violate norms, and the President's open admission that he did so in order to get Mr. Comey off his back showed how casually he will disregard laws. This disregard is based on confidence that there will be no repercussions, and the cowed performance of the GOP makes his assumption seem reasonable. Even if the investigation is carried out, and crimes are confirmed, who will act on the findings?\n\nLikely not Attorney-General Jeff Sessions, who as Mr. Comey noted, participated in his firing despite the fact that he is supposed to have recused himself from an investigation in which he, too, is implicated. The rot of the Trump administration runs deep, and extends beyond the U.S. borders. In a heartbreaking hearing, James Comey pledged allegiance to a version of the United States that is slipping away.\n\n\"A republic, if you can keep it,\" Ben Franklin famously said. Mr. Comey tried."],[5,"Every Insane Thing Donald Trump Has Said About Global Warming – Mother Jones","Donald Trump has a lot of things to say about global warming.

Mr Trump said he had acted on the recommendation of senior figures at the Justice Department, criticising Mr Comey's handling of the investigation over Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\nMr Comey was sworn in as the seventh FBI director in September 2013, under the Obama administration.\n\nHe was in his fourth year of a potential 10-year term, heading the organisation within the Justice Department with a broad array of powers to investigate domestic crime and to gather intelligence.\n\nAccording to federal law, the president has authority to both appoint and dismiss the director of the FBI, as well as other senior officials in the Justice Department, but the nominee has to pass hearings and be confirmed by a simple majority vote in the Senate.\n\nOnly one FBI director has been removed by the President in the bureau's 100-plus-year history. That man was William Sessions, who was fired by President Bill Clinton in 1993.\n\nAs president, Mr Trump has used his power to remove senior officials in the Justice Department before. He fired the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, at the end of January this year.\n\nThe White House says the search for the next director has already begun.\n\nBefore his removal from office, Mr Comey was in charge of investigations into alleged Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. During a Senate hearing on 20 March 2017, Mr Comey acknowledged that potential links between Trump's associates and Russia were also under review.\n\nThere's no reason why the investigation would stop, but with Mr Comey gone, Democrats in Congress are demanding that a special prosecutor be appointed to oversee the investigation into Russian involvement in the election."],[5,"Trump Meets the Pope: Ivanka, Melania in Veils","President Donald Trump met Pope Francis at the Vatican on Wednesday in an exchange described by witnesses as “stiff.”\n\nTrump was flanked by First Lady Melania and First Daughter Ivanka, who strictly stuck to the dress code.

In the first minutes of the meeting, the pope did not say anything to Trump and did not smile. \n\nTrump, who has canceled President Obama’s climate change initiatives and proposed drastic cuts to environmental protection programs, was welcomed to Rome Tuesday night with a pointed message illuminated on the dome of St. Peter’s Basillica: “Planet Earth First,” it read, according to CNN correspondent Jeff Zeleny, who tweeted a photo of the unusually placed riff on Trump’s “America First” slogan.\n\nThe mood lifted with a gift exchange between the president and Pope Francis. Trump presented the pope with a case of books from Martin Luther King.\n\n“I think you will enjoy them,” the president told him.\n\nThe pope gave Trump three books on the topics of family, the joy of the gospel and “care of our common home, the environment,” as well as a medal by a Roman artist featuring an olive, a simple of peace, signed by the pope.\n\n“We can use peace,” Trump said.\n\nWATCH: First Lady Melania Trump Appears to Swat Away the President’s Hand\n\nOne of the pope’s attendants gave Melania a small object, which she asked Pope Francis to bless.\n\nThe also pope joked with the first lady, asking “What do you give him to eat — potica?” referring to a nut-filled cake from Melania’s home country of Slovenia.\n\nJust before he left, Trump was heard telling Pope Francis, “Thank you.

It was also increasingly obstructive, and might have trespassed into criminal territory even if Trump had not then fired Comey for refusing to do as asked, lied about his rationale, bragged to Russians that the firing Comey had “taken off” the pressure of the Russia investigation, then threatened to release secretly recorded tapes to intimidate Comey out of providing this very testimony.\n\nAfter seeking his patronage, Trump asked Comey to end the Flynn investigation, and to remove the “cloud” of the Russia investigation. As a legal matter, obstruction of justice requires an element of “corrupt intent” on the part of the obstructer. That intent became plain after the firing, but even in the moment, it was easily inferred. Trump, again, cleared the Oval Office, suggesting he was aware his request was improper, and later communicated his belief that Comey’s unwillingness to lift the “cloud” of the Russia investigation reflected unreciprocated loyalty.\n\nJust within the four corners of this prepared testimony, Trump’s pattern of behavior looks like obstruction of justice.\n\nIn a bygone era, we might expect Trump’s appointees to defect from the administration. In a less polarized time, the president might be forced to resign or face impeachment and removal by the Congress.\n\nIn the current environment, we can expect nothing of the sort. Though Sessions did reportedly offer to resign, it was not because of the president’s legal or ethical conduct, but because the president was angry that the attorney general recused himself, and can thus not participate overtly in the cover-up.\n\nWhen Comey, according to his statement, implored Sessions “to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me,” and told him that leaving the two alone “was inappropriate and should never happen,” Sessions “did not reply.”\n\nAfter the March 30 phone call, Comey phoned then-Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente “to report the substance of the call from the President, and … await his guidance.” Comey did not hear back.\n\nTrump’s loyalists, including his personal lawyer, are ignoring all of this, choosing instead to celebrate that as of March 30, Trump wasn’t under investigation.\n\nIf past is prologue, House Speaker Paul Ryan will read Comey’s opening statement, watch Thursday’s hearing, and reconcile himself to ignoring the crisis the testimony depicts—a dangerous, lawless president whose crimes erode his already meager capacity to do the job.\n\nBut it is a crisis. March 30 was more than two months ago. Trump wasn’t the subject of an investigation then, but there is no justification for that now. The people isolating one narrow detail to the exclusion of the dire portrait Comey painted are, in the most dishonorable way, prioritizing raw power over the interests and security of the nation."],[5,"Preliminary Impeachment Papers Filed Against Donald Trump","The people frustrated with this Trump Administration might be getting what they want, as a top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee has filed an “Articles of Inquiry” into the president.

While Clinton was later acquitted of these charges by the Senate, it may be hard to argue the same for Drumpf after all the damage he has done in three weeks.\n\n“Donald Trump has refused to step away from his business interests in any meaningful way,” Nadler said in a statement announcing the move. “His foreign entanglements are likely unconstitutional, he has repeated refused to disclose his financial assets, and he is clouded by the specter of Russian intervention in the election and his Administration.”\n\nThe Judiciary Committee must respond to the Articles of Inquiry within 14 legislative days, or Congressional workdays, according to Countable.

We implore everyone to unite: we are one community.\n\n\"In the face of such dastardly cowardice, unlike the terrorists, we must uphold love and compassion.\n\n\"Such criminals defile the name of our religion and of our Prophet, who was sent to be a mercy to all creation.\n\n\"We commend our police and emergency services – with whom we stand shoulder to shoulder – for their rapid response, arriving at the scenes while risking their own lives to protect the victims and public.\n\n\"Their response exemplifies the courage, humanity and honour we must exhibit in such difficult times.\n\n\"We pray for peace and unity, and for all the victims of terror both at home and across the globe, who are targeted, irrespective of their faith.”"],[10,"Finsbury Park worshippers pinned 'attacker' to the ground","A hero Imam has described how he prevented a mob attack on the Finsbury Park terror suspect just moments after Muslim worshippers were mown down outside a mosque. \n\nMuslim leader Mohammed Mahmoud stepped in when an angry crowd attempted to 'kick and punch' the suspect as he was being restrained by three men following the suspected terror attack.\n\nMoments earlier, a white van had ploughed into a group of people outside the Muslim Welfare House in north London as they left evening prayers. \n\nTen people were injured - including two who were disabled - and one man has since died.\n\nA 47-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder has been further arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism including murder and attempted murder.\n\nThis afternoon, Mr Mahmoud said he and a 'group of brothers' had managed to 'extinguish any flames of mob rule' as members of the public attempted to hurt the alleged terrorist 'from every angle'.\n\nHe added that, despite tensions running high, the suspect - who is white - had come away 'unscathed' and remained 'calm and silent' as he was arrested by officers. \n\nPolice are currently searching addresses in Cardiff as they continue to investigate the attack. \n\nMr Mahmoud told the BBC: 'By God's grace we managed to surround him and to protect him from any harm.\n\n'We stopped all forms of attack and abuse towards him that were coming from every angle.'\n\nMr Mahmoud said that, while the chaos unfolded, a police car drove past which he and some others managed to flag down.\n\n'We told them the situation,' he continued. 'We said \"he is restrained, he mowed people down with a van, there is a mob attempting to hurt him, if you don't take him God forbid he might be seriously hurt.\n\n'We pushed people away from him until he was safely taken by police into custody and put in the back of the van.\n\n'It wasn't me alone - there was a group of brothers who were calm and collected and managed to calm people down and to extinguish any flames of anger or mob rule that would've taken charge had this group of mature brothers not stepped in.'\n\nPolice confirmed that one person - an elderly man was being helped by a group of people after collapsing outside the mosque - has died. Officers are still investigating whether the man's death was linked to the terror attack.\n\nBut, today, Mr Mahmoud described how the man had 'regained consciousness' moments before the van ploughed into the road.\n\nHe also revealed that the deceased's brother was treated for injuries at the scene.\n\nHe said: 'The van drove perpendicular to Seven Sisters road. It drove at a 90 degree angle to the direction of the road - it was enough to make some people fly off under the side.\n\n'It dragged two people underneath him - one they were worried might be paralysed because he could not feel his arms and legs.' \n\nEarlier, the imam was hailed as the 'hero of the day' by Toufik Kacimi, chief executive of the Muslim Welfare House, for calming the angry crowd.\n\nIt is claimed he told them: 'Don't hit him - you do not touch him - hand him into the police'. At the time, the suspect was allegedly shouting: 'I want to kill all Muslims - I did my bit' before telling crowds: 'Kill me, kill me'. \n\nScotland Yard has since praised the 'restraint' of the crowds who protected the alleged killer before the police arrived to arrest him.  \n\nAs he spoke to cameras, the imam added the community was staying calm in the wake of the attack.\n\n'This community of ours is mild mannered and a calm community, not known for our violence. Our mosques are incredibly peaceful,' he said. \n\n'We will do our utmost to calm down any tensions. But, immediately after the incident, people were calm, people were praying for the victims of the attack and everybody knew there was nothing they could do but pray for them.'\n\nHe added that it had been a 'tragic and barbaric attack' while proved that the 'demonisation' of the Muslim community was 'succeeding'.  \n\n'To hear him say \"I did my bit\" may be proof that this demonisation of the Muslim community by those who wish to divide this city have succeeded to some extent in influencing the vulnerable to think we must be eliminated,' he said.\n\n'We just hope that in times of tragedy people come together and unite.'  \n\nToday, it emerged that police were force to hold back crowds after they arrested the suspect while he smirked and tried to goad witnesses to his Islamophobic attack into killing him.\n\nThe 47-year-old driver, who was not known to police and MI5, ploughed his white van into a crowd of Ramadan worshippers helping an elderly man who collapsed in the heat, killing one and injuring at least ten more at 12.20am this morning.\n\nThe unnamed white man in a blue T-shirt - who suffered a black eye and cuts to his face and hands - was filmed repeatedly shouting 'kill me' to the men who grabbed him.\n\nOfficers held back crowds after arresting the terror suspect who was smiling, waving and even blowing kisses, with police today praising the 'restraint' shown in aftermath of the van attack.\n\nWitnesses said he 'deliberately' drove onto the pavement outside north London's Muslim Welfare House - yards from the Finsbury Park Mosque - and jumped out of the cab shouting 'I'm going to kill all Muslims - I did my bit'.\n\nBut as he tried to run from the scene a group of men gave chase and were filmed pinning the suspect to the floor before dragging him along the road as bodies lay strewn across the ground.\n\nScotland Yard has said they are treating the white van attack as a terrorist incident and assistant commissioner Neil Basu today praised the 'restraint' of those who detained the suspect at the scene and handed him over to police.\n\nThey have arrested the 47-year-old on suspicion of attempted murder as they ascertain if the elderly man who died at the scene had already passed away before the white van ran him over.\n\nOutside Downing Street the Prime Minister Theresa May described the Finsbury Park as 'another terrorist attack on the streets of London - every bit as sickening as those that have come before.'\n\nThe group were leaving taraweeh, late night prayers observed during the festival of Ramadan, when the van struck. One victim was stuck under its wheels and a group managed to life the vehicle and pull him out.\n\nThe attack is fourth terror attack in Britain since March - one in Manchester and three in London - claiming 36 lives so far.\n\nSpeaking outside 10 Downing Street, Mrs May said the attack had 'once again targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives - this time, British Muslims as they left a mosque, having broken their fast and prayed together at this sacred time of year'.\n\nShe added: 'Today we come together, as we have done before, to condemn this act and to state once again that hatred and evil of this kind will never succeed.'\n\nMrs May said that the attack on Muslims was 'every bit as insidious and destructive to our values and our way of life' as the recent string of terror attacks apparently motivated by Islamist extremism, adding: 'We will stop at nothing to defeat it.'\n\nShe later visited the mosque and spoke to faith leaders with Met Commissioner Dick.   \n\nAs details of the attack emerged, the Muslim Council of Britain condemned the incident - which took place shortly after the congregation finished Ramadan evening prayers - as 'the most violent manifestation' yet of Islamophobia and called for extra security around mosques.\n\nThe Met Police has now vowed to put extra security around mosques at this 'sensitive time' as Muslims continue to mark the holy month of Ramadan. Mr Basu said it was an 'incredibly challenging time for London' with emergency services 'stretched' but that officers would do all they could to keep people safe. \n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan also urged people to 'remain calm and vigilant' and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said the attack was 'quite clearly an attack on Muslims'. \n\nVideo posted online of the aftermath of the attack show scenes of chaos as people tried to help the injured.\n\nOne man could been seen giving CPR to a victim in the street while another man's head injury was treated with a makeshift dressing. People could be heard shouting and screaming amid the chaos and bloodstains were visible on the pavement.  \n\nFurther dramatic footage from the scene shows the suspect - who was described as looking 'indifferent' and 'like he didn't care' - waving as he is bundled into the back of a police van. \n\nAt the time of the attack, which was just after midnight, several people were heroically giving first aid to an elderly member of the public who had collapsed at the bus stop with a medical issue.  \n\nOther witnesses to the attack early on Monday morning have also described how they wrestled the suspected terrorist to the ground - but stopped others from hitting him until officers took over.\n\nAdil Rana, 24, who was outside the mosque when the van drove towards the crowd, said the driver gestured towards and mocked the crowds as he was taken away by police.\n\nHe added: 'When he got arrested, he was taunting, saying: 'I'd do it again, I'd do it again.''\n\nDescribing the initial moments after the van careered into pedestrians, he went on: 'The driver jumped out and then he was pinned down to the floor and people were punching him and beating him, which was reasonable because of what he's done.\n\n'And then the imam of the mosque actually came out and said: 'Don't hit him, hand him over to the police, pin him down'.' \n\nFootage captured on mobile phones at the scene shows the van driver being held on the ground as people call for police.\n\nA man can be heard urgently shouting: 'No-one touch him - no-one! No-one!'\n\nAbdulrahman Saleh Alamoudi said he was among a group of people helping an elderly worshipper who had fallen down, perhaps because of the heat, when the van swerved towards them.\n\nHe told BuzzFeed News: 'Luckily I managed to escape. And then the guy came out of his van and I got him.\n\n'He was screaming, he was saying: 'I'm going to kill all Muslims, I'm going to kill all Muslims.' He was throwing punches.\n\n'Then we managed to get him on the floor. Then he was saying,: 'Kill me, kill me.' I said: 'We are not going to kill you. Why did you do that?' He wouldn't say anything.'\n\nMr Salah Alamoudi said he had also helped to hold the suspect on the ground for up to half an hour before police arrived.\n\n'The guy, I had to keep him at least half an hour. He was a strong guy. A big man,' he said. \n\nEyewitness Hussain Ali, 28, said that, while being restrained, the man was protected by the people he is thought to have been targeting.\n\nHe said: 'The leader of the mosque said: 'You do not touch him'. He was sitting and holding him like that, people kept holding him.' \n\nThe police then arrived and cuffed him.\n\nAs well as the one confirmed fatality, police said a further eight casualties are being treated across three London hospitals for 'serious injuries' while two victims sustained minor injuries and were treated at the scene.\n\nMr Basu also confirmed that the probe was being handled by terror the Counter Terrorism Command. Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed the incident is being treated as a potential terror attack and called an emergency meeting of the Cobra Committee.\n\nSpeaking this morning outside Scotland Yard, Mr Basu said: 'Sadly Londoners are are waking up to the news of another dreadful incident in the capital that has left a number of people seriously injured.   \n\n'This was an attack on London and all Londoners and we should all stand together against extremists whatever their cause. Now is a time to unite those who seek to divide us.'\n\nHe added: 'I would like to praise the police officers who immediately responded gave life saving treatment at the scene, but also very much those members of the public who assisted before and after this incident.\n\n'At the scene, detained by members of the community, was the man suspected of being the driver. He has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.\n\n'I would like to thank those people who helped police in detaining the man and who worked with officers to calmly and quickly get him in to our custody. Their restraint in the circumstances is commendable.'\n\nConfirming the fatality, he added that the incident unfolded while a man was already receiving first aid.\n\n'Any causative link between his death and the attack will form part of the investigation. It is too early to say whether his death is a result of the attack,' he added. \n\nToday, Toufik Kacimi, chief executive of the Muslim Welfare House, said the suspect had shouted 'I did my bit' after carrying out the attack.\n\nHe told Sky News: 'After the event, he did say 'I did my bit'. It means he is not mentally ill, he is conscious, he did what he did deliberately to hit and kill as many Muslims as possible.'\n\nHe added that the imam - who had been leading the evening prayer, known as taraweeh - had saved the suspect's life after he ploughed the van into a wall and fences and other members of the public began beating him. \n\n'He hit almost a wall and fences at the end of the road because it was a dead road. So people grabbed him outside and starting hitting him,' he added. \n\n'Our imam went there and saved the life of the attacker. There is a wild video which you can see filmed by one of our worshippers and you can see clearly our imam saving the life of this guy and the guy at this time was saying 'I did my bit'.' \n\nAnother witness, who wanted to be identified as Abdulrahman, which is not his real name, said he was one of the people who helped to remove the driver from the van.\n\n'He wanted to run away and was saying, 'I want to kill Muslims',' he said.\n\n'So he came back to the main road and I managed to get him to the ground and me and some other guys managed to hold him until the police arrived, for about 20 minutes I think, until the police arrived.'\n\nAbdulrahman claimed the driver said 'kill me' as he was held on the ground.   \n\nAbdikadar Warfa said he also helped to detain the suspect while his friends helped victims.\n\n'I saw a man underneath the van. He was bleeding. My friend said he had to lift the van, I was busy with a man who tried to escape. My friend said he said some words, but I didn't hear it,' he said.\n\n'They (people who were hit) were mostly young. They are very bad. I tried to stop him (the suspect), some people were hitting him but I said stop him and keep him until the police came.\n\n'He was trying to run away but people overpowered him. He was fighting to run away.'\n\nLocal resident Abdul Abdullah, 18, who was also at the scene, described the suspect as looking 'indifferent' and 'like he didn't even care'. \n\nShocking eyewitness accounts had earlier revealed how the van raced down the bus lane before swerving down a dead end road and mowing down members of the public.  \n\nAdil Rana, 24, said he saw blood and 'people dead on the floor' in the aftermath.\n\n'The van was driving towards us to try and basically hit us at speed and everyone was shocked and people were screaming. There were people on the floor,' he said. \n\nMr Rana, from Walthamstow, said he also saw the driver being held on the ground by some of the crowd after getting out the vehicle.\n\nHe said: 'The driver jumped out and then he was pinned down to the floor and people were punching him and beating him, which was reasonable because of what he's done.\n\n'And then the imam of the mosque actually came out and said 'Don't hit him, hand him over to the police, pin him down'.'\n\nMr Rana said the driver gestured and mocked the crowds as he was taken away by police. 'When he got arrested, he was taunting, saying 'I'd do it again, I'd do it again',' he added.  \n\nEmergency service crews were also seen giving cardiac massages to the injured in a desperate bid to save them, but unconfirmed reports that two other suspects fled the van were denied by police.\n\nThe police operation is being handled by counter-terrorism units, while the suspect has been taken to hospital and will be detained once he has been discharged, and will then face a mental health assessment. \n\nToday, police and forensic officers were seen scouring the area for clues as the terror investigation got underway.   \n\nFlowers were handed to police, who put the tributes inside the cordoned off area. One tribute reads: 'This hideous crime is not who we are. Finsbury Park represents the best of London. Love and tolerance.'\n\nStaff from a local cafe were also seen giving coffees and bottles of water to officers guarding the scene. \n\nPolice said the suspect had been taken to hospital as a precaution and would be taken into custody once discharged and subjected to a mental health assessment in due course.\n\nSome witnesses at the scene said more than one attacker may have been involved.\n\nBut the Met said: 'At this early stage of this investigation, no other suspects at the scene have been identified or reported to police, however the investigation continues.' \n\nMeanwhile, a member of staff at Pontyclun Van Hire said the company would not be issuing a statement. She said: 'We are not saying anything, we don't know anything at the moment.'\n\nThe website shows that anyone wanting to hire a vehicle must show their driving licence and a utility bill or bank statement featuring a current address. \n\nToday, police interviewed staff at the company, which is based 12 miles north of Cardiff.    \n\nThe Finsbury Park Mosque gained notoriety more than a decade ago for sermons by hate preacher Abu Hamza, who was imam from 1997 until 2003 and was sentenced to life in a U.S. prison in January 2015 for his conviction on terrorism-related charges. \n\nA new board of trustees and management took over in February 2005, a year after Abu Hamza was arrested by British police.\n\nSince the, the mosque has undergone wholesale changes and become far more liberal under new leader Mohammed Kozbar.\n\nAttendance has greatly increased among worshippers from various communities, according to the mosque's website.   \n\nMr Kozbar, described the incident as 'a cowardly attack which is no different than the attacks in Manchester and London'.\n\n'Our community is in shock, our thought and prayer with those who have been affected by this,' he said.  \n\nIn a statement posted on its website, the Finsbury Park Mosque said it 'condemns in the strongest terms a heinous terrorist attack'.\n\n'The van driver deliberately mowed down Muslim men and women leaving late evening prayers from Finsbury Park Mosque and Muslim Welfare House just after midnight,' the statement said.\n\n'This is a callous terrorist attack, which coincides with the murdered MP, Jo Cox, anniversary.' \n\nThe statement added: 'Finally, our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.\n\n'We urge all attending mosques and going about their business to remain vigilant in this difficult time.'\n\n'It's not safe anymore after what's been happening. It's not been safe to walk. \n\n'Two people ran away and one got taken away to the police. \n\nThe attack comes just two weeks after eight were killed in a terror attack in London Bridge, when three extremists mowed down pedestrians on the bridge before launching a stabbing frenzy in pubs and clubs in nearby Borough Market.  \n\nThree months ago, Khalid Masood also mowed down four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing PC Keith Palmer to death on the cobbled forecourt of the Houses of Parliament.  \n\nIt was also less than a month ago that terrorist Salman Abedi detonated a suicide bomb killing 22 people, including children, after an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena. \n\nFabian Santana, 22, who saw last night's carnage unfold, said he felt as though the capital was no longer 'safe'.  \n\n'I just feel like London for the last couple of weeks has not been safe. I'd rather go out of London,' he added. \n\nJamal, 21, echoed his fears, telling MailOnline: 'I think it's terrible what happened in so many locations I don't know if I'm going to be alive tomorrow, I'm worried what's going to happen tomorrow, it's scary\n\n'It's not safe in London, total, 100 per cent it is not safe, I'm worried to come out of my house right now, it's not safe.' \n\nJeremy Corbyn expressed his shock at the incident, which took place in the heart of his Islington North constituency, and appeared to be in tears.\n\nHe said: 'I'm totally shocked at the incident at Finsbury Park tonight. I've been in touch with the mosques, police and Islington council regarding the incident.\n\n'My thoughts are with those and the community affected by this awful event.'\n\nHather Ali, 31, was inside the mosque where Jeremy Corbyn addressed 150 people later.\n\nHe told MailOnline: 'He was giving a message of unity and said that everyone needs to work together.\n\n'He said that everyone needs to be calm and stick together to overcome such extremism.\n\n'The response from the community and local politicians has been excellent. The emergency services have also been great since the attack happened.\n\n'After something like this there will be a sense of fear. But as long as we are united as a community we can eradicate this.' \n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan urged people to remain vigilant, saying: 'We don't yet know the full details, but this was clearly a deliberate attack on innocent Londoners, many of whom were finishing prayers during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\n'While this appears to be an attack on a particular community, like the terrible attacks in Manchester, Westminster and London Bridge it is also an assault on all our shared values of tolerance, freedom and respect'.\n\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said: 'My thoughts are with all those affected by the appalling incident at Finsbury Park.\n\n'I am in contact with the Metropolitan Police who have confirmed it is being investigated by their Counter Terrorism Command.\n\n'We must all continue to stand together, resolute, against all those who try to divide us and spread hate and fear.'\n\nLabour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, whose Hackney North and Stoke Newington constituency lies close to the scene, called for police to review security at mosques.\n\nShe tweeted: 'Terror attack outside #FinsburyPark mosque. Police must urgently review security for all mosques #StandTogether.'\n\nAnother witness, a courier who gave his name as Andrew, said he saw three people on the floor and at least one of them appeared to be in Muslim dress.\n\nThe 45-year-old, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, said he was driving back from a night shift when he saw the aftermath of the collision.\n\nHe said: 'When I drove past slowly I could count three people on the floor and police were performing CPR on one of them. The guy having CPR performed on him was in a gown, ethnic clothing.'\n\nOne resident told how he jumped out of the way as the van struck pedestrians.\n\nThe man, who did not want to be named, said: 'The gentleman went straight down this road, people were just conversing, talking, just doing what we're doing. And he just came into all of us.\n\n'There was a lot of people. We got told to move straight away. I was shocked, shocked, shocked. There were bodies around me. \n\n'Thank God I just moved to the side, I just jumped. Everyone is hurt. Everyone is actually hurt.' \n\nJennifer Heape said: 'Apparently a van has ploughed into people coming from Finsbury Park mosque. People are reporting of several injured, some fatalities. \n\n'Police are escorting people home very calmly. They are making sure people stay indoors.\n\n'No panic, but it's very serious. A LOT of helicopters.' \n\nAn eyewitness who lives on Seven Sisters Road told the BBC there were people 'shouting and screaming'.\n\nShe added: 'Everyone was shouting 'a van's hit people'.\n\n'There was this white van stopped outside Finsbury Park Mosque that seems to have hit people who were coming out of the mosque after prayers finished.' \n\nA Metropolitan Police helicopter was seen circling overhead as photographs posted on social media showed a huge response from the emergency services.\n\nDozens of police cars and vans cordoned off a large area of the normally bustling thoroughfare as stunned locals gathered at the scene.  \n\nMehdi, a 38-year-old worshipper, told the Evening Standard: 'There were loads of people coming out and the van took a left and went straight into them.\n\n'The crowd caught a guy. He tried to do a London Bridge thing.'\n\nA woman named Hajal said her sister witnessed the immediate aftermath of the incident.\n\nShe told LBC Radio: 'Everyone was just running everywhere she didn't realise what was going on at first until she people on the floor.\n\n'She ran to see first victim and realised it was a family friend.'\n\n'An old man didn't have a pulse. Police came and took over. She said it could have been an accident.\n\n'At first she thought there was some sort of fight. There were 15 to 20 people hitting somebody - she didn't realise it was the man who ran over the people.\n\n'She said someone was still under the van but he was breathing. The second [more seriously injured] person was family friend who at first said he couldn't feel his legs.' \n\nAnother person who lives nearby, Ishmael, told the station: 'I pray there regularly. I'm there right now. There's a very close friend of mine and in a very bad critical condition.\n\n'I hear from the other guys that they just stand there and have a coffee.\n\n'The van drove to there. I had just left the area because I wasn't feeling very well.\n\n'One of my friends witnessed it. He told me the van went through the people standing there. 6 or 7 people, and one Asian guy is definitely dead.\n\n'My friend is in bad critical condition. He was under the van. His head was bleeding.\n\n'Someone took a video of him. Very shocking video. He's got family and a wife.\n\n'The police answered the phone and told me he's alright. But the other friend they don't really know his condition. They're both in ambulances and heading to a London Hospital.\n\n'Something's going to happen here one day here. Since that incident I had a feeling something was going to happen to the Mosque. We don't have no security.\n\n'This is Ramadan and there was no security at all. Anyone who wants to do anything can come there. If someone wants to kill hundreds they can come there easily.' \n\nAbdikadar Warfa said: 'I saw a man underneath the van. He was bleeding. My friend said he had to lift the van, I was busy with a man who tried to escape.\n\n'My friend said he said some words, but I didn't hear it.\n\n'They (people who were hit) were mostly young. They are very bad.\n\n'I tried to stop him (the suspect), some people were hitting him but I said stop him and keep him until the police came.\n\n'He was trying to run away but people overpowered him.

We must do the same to those who peddle Islamophobia'.\n\nMother-of-two Mrs Cox, who represented the Batley and Spen conctituency in West Yorkshire, was shot and stabbed as she arrived for a constituency surgery in Birstall on June 16 last year. \n\nLondon Ambulance Service Deputy Director of Operations, Kevin Bate said: 'We were called at 12.15am to reports of a road traffic collision at Seven Sisters Road.\n\n'We have sent a number of ambulance crews, advance paramedics and specialist responses teams to the scene. An advance trauma team from London's Air Ambulance has also been dispatched by car.\n\n'We are working closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene.\n\n'Our priority is to assess the level and nature of injuries and ensure those in the most need are treated first and taken to hospital.\n\n'More information will follow when we have it.'\n\nMuhbeen Hussain, founder of British Muslim Youth, said: 'We strongly condemn this horrendous suspected terrorist attack and pray for the innocent victims and their families that have been affected by this incident.\n\n'I have personally visited the scene of the attack and spoke to many eyewitnesses, many of whom were quite emotional after witnessing a murder and seeing many people being injured. \n\n'In less than a month, we have witnessed horrific attacks in Manchester, London Bridge, Borough Markets, a tragedy at Grenfell Tower and now this horrific attack.\n\n'We as communities stood united in all of these difficult times and we must come together once more.\n\n'I also urge anyone that has further information to speak to the police, so they have as much information as possible to deal with the on-going investigation.'  \n\nMember of the London Muslim Community Forum, Shiraz Kothia, also called for calm in the face of the tragedy.\n\nHe told MailOnline: 'First of all we need to look after the community and make sure everyone is safe.\n\n'No matter what faith or ideology it is, we need to tackle extremism. I have worked with the Metropolitan Police after the Manchester and London Bridge attacks and we will continue to work with everyone in the community.\n\n'Everyone must remain calm. There is no faith to terrorism. Tomorrow is could be a synagogue or a church. We must come together to stop it.\n\n'We will be hosting some gatherings after this now and we will need the rabbis, priests, ministers and imams to come together.' \n\n'Do not touch him': Hero imam saves Finsbury Park terror suspect by calling for calm so police can arrest him \n\nA hero Imam helped pin down the Finsbury Park terror suspect and told angry crowds: 'Don't hit him - you do not touch him - hand him into the police'. \n\nMuslim leader Mohammed Mahmoud urged irate witnesses not to attack the alleged killer after he ploughed into a crowd at high speed while driving a white van.\n\nThe extraordinary appeal for calm came while the suspect, 47, was shouting 'I want to kill all Muslims - I did my bit' before telling crowds that surrounded him: 'Kill me, kill me'.\n\nBut Mr Mahmoud repeatedly yelled: 'Don't hit him, hand him over to the police, pin him down' and more men joined him in protecting the unnamed white van driver.\n\nScotland Yard has praised the 'restraint' of the crowds who protected the alleged killer before the police arrived to arrest him. \n\nAdil Rana, 24, who was outside the mosque when the van drove towards the crowd, saw blood and 'people dead on the floor' in the aftermath.\n\nHe told the Press Association: 'The van was driving towards us to try and basically hit us at speed and everyone was shocked and people were screaming. There were people on the floor.'\n\nMr Rana, from Walthamstow, said the driver was held on the ground by some of the crowd after getting out the vehicle.\n\nHe said: 'The driver jumped out and then he was pinned down to the floor and people were punching him and beating him, which was reasonable because of what he's done.\n\n'And then the imam of the mosque actually came out and said 'Don't hit him, hand him over to the police, pin him down'.'\n\nMr Rana said the driver gestured and mocked the crowds as he was taken away by police.\n\nHe added: 'When he got arrested, he was taunting, saying 'I'd do it again, I'd do it again'.'\n\nEyewitness Abdul Rahman told the BBC said the white van driver clearly said he wanted to 'kill all Muslims'.\n\nMr Rahman, hit him and then helped pin him down.\n\nHe said: 'When the guy came out from his van he wanted to escape, run away and he was saying: 'I want to kill Muslims. I want to kill Muslims'.\n\n'I hit him on his stomach and then me and the other guys, we held him to the ground until he couldn't move. We stopped him until the police came.'\n\nEyewitness Hussain Ali, 28, said that, while being restrained, the man was protected by the people he is thought to have been targeting.\n\nHe said: 'The leader of the mosque said 'You do not touch him'. He was sitting and holding him like that, people kept holding him.\n\n'All the police and helicopters came after around eight minutes.'\n\nMr Ali described the horrifying scene unfolding outside the Islamic centre in north London early on Monday morning.\n\n'All I heard was a banging, then I turned and saw all the shouting and running.\n\n'I saw people taking a man from underneath the van, he was black, bleeding, he was not dead, he was alive.\n\n'There was a man in a wheelchair, a man underneath the van, it was hell.\n\n'People who were inside saw the attacker was smiling, he was waving, he was happy.\n\n'It was panic, people were shouting, screaming, some saying it was an accident.\n\n'It was panic, it was horror.'  \n\nScotland Yard has today thanked them for detaining him.\n\nToufik Kacimi, chief executive of the Muslim Welfare House, said the local community was 'horrified' by the incident and appealed for calm.\n\nHe also thanked Imam Mohammed Mahmoud 'whose bravery and courage helped calm the immediate situation after the incident and prevented further injuries and potential loss of life'.\n\n'We have worked very hard over decades to build a peaceful and tolerant community here in Finsbury Park and we totally condemn any act of hate that tries to drive our wonderful community apart,' Mr Kacimi said.\n\n'We would appeal for calm at this time. It is unhelpful for there to be speculation about the incident. All of our efforts should be towards getting justice for the victims and ensuring our community stays the diverse, tolerant and welcome place we know it to be.'\n\nHe added: 'An old man has passed away, what for? What did he do? He was just coming out of prayers, a nice gentleman going home after prayers and he is hit and killed by a car - what did he do? Why? Why?\n\n'The guy, he came out and said 'You deserve, I did my bit, you deserve it' and he was shouting and screaming abusive language - what for? What did he do, this man? He is an innocent man'.  \n\nMr Kacimi said the Muslim Welfare House had met with police, the council and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is MP for Islington North, in the wake of the incident.\n\nHe added: 'I would like to particularly thank our Imam Mohammed Mahmoud, whose bravery and courage helped calm the immediate situation after the incident and prevented further injuries and potential loss of life.'  \n\nPolice have paid tribute to the men who held him down after the attack on a group of worshippers near a mosque by a man in a white van.\n\nOne man died after the terror suspect, described as a large white man, targeted people near the Finsbury Park Mosque in north London early on Monday. \n\nMetropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said: 'This is being treated as a terrorist attack.'\n\nHe added: 'I would like to thank those people who helped police in detaining the man and worked with officers to calmly and quickly get him into our custody.\n\n'Their restraint in the circumstances was commendable'. "],[10,"‘I Trusted Him’: London Attacker Was Friendly With Neighbors","Even so, Prime Minister Theresa May found herself on the defensive on Monday, as rivals challenged her record on security after the third terrorist episode in three months.\n\nMrs. May, who is leading her Conservative Party into a national election on Thursday, held the portfolio in charge of security for six years before replacing David Cameron as prime minister in July, and she oversaw a reduction in police forces, including armed officers, during that time.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police released photographs on Monday of Mr. Butt, 27, and Mr. Redouane, 30.\n\nMr. Redouane had claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, the police said, and also sometimes used a pseudonym, Rachid Elkhdar. The authorities are still trying to confirm the identity of the third attacker.\n\nMr. Butt appeared briefly in a Channel 4 television documentary last year about extremists living in Britain. The film, which is available on Netflix, featured a number of British Muslim men openly expressing their support for violence. In one scene, Mr. Butt stands in line with five other men in Regent’s Park in London as another man kneels in front of them unfurling an Islamic State flag.\n\nIn Barking, residents of the Elizabeth Fry Apartments on Kings Road said Mr. Butt had lived in the building with his wife and young children, including a newborn.\n\n“His wife just gave birth, the baby was 2 weeks old,” said Nasser Ali, who lives in the building facing Mr. Butt’s apartment.\n\nAnother neighbor said he would see Mr. Butt coming and going from the apartment complex. “I just saw him going in and out,” said the neighbor, Shehzad Khurram. “I saw him walking his kids.”\n\nIt was the van that struck a chord with Ken Chigbo, one of Mr. Butt’s neighbors in Barking.\n\n“He approached me about a week ago, making conversation, and found out I’m moving home,” Mr. Chigbo recalled in a phone interview on Sunday, before the police had officially identified Mr. Butt as one of the attackers. “He was just being polite. Then he said, ‘Look, Ken, where did you get your van from? How much did you pay? Do they do it in automatic?’ ”\n\nMr. Chigbo knew Mr. Butt only as Abs, the nickname everyone seemed to call him. He had recalled how “he would always be in a religious gown to his shins, with tracksuit bottoms and trainers underneath.” But on Monday Mr. Chigbo identified Mr. Butt in a photograph released by police as the same man.\n\nThe two men met barely a week after Mr. Chigbo moved into the complex three years ago. “He invited me and everyone to a barbecue in the block’s shared garden green area a week ago,” Mr. Chigbo said. “He’s a neighbor. I trusted him, we got on.”\n\nSarah Sekyejwe, who lives with her husband and children in the newly built row of houses next to the Elizabeth Fry Apartments, said Mr. Butt had moved to the street in 2014 and befriended the local children. “My daughter says he’s the one who on Halloween would open the door and give them lots of sweets,” she recalled. “And in the summer he put out a table-tennis table and taught the kids how to play.”\n\nMr. Chigbo said small groups of three or four “Muslim guys” used to regularly visit Mr. Butt’s apartment. “I found them quite intimidating, actually,” he said. “They were always in religious robes and wearing red and white checkered scarves wrapped around their heads.”\n\nTwelve people were arrested in the investigation into the terror attack, and homes in East London were raided. But on Monday night, the police said that all those in custody had been “released without charge.”\n\nThe main political parties suspended campaigning on Sunday as a sign of respect for the seven people killed and the scores wounded in the attack, but as electioneering resumed on Monday, so did the pressure on Mrs. May.\n\nAlthough there has been widespread praise for the professionalism and courage of the armed officers who shot and killed the assailants within eight minutes of being called Saturday night, the country’s broader antiterrorism strategy was questioned.\n\n“I am so sick of Theresa May blaming others for terror when the system she presided over has obviously failed so lamentably,” Steve Hilton, once a close adviser to Mr. Cameron, wrote on Twitter. Mrs. May, he added in a separate tweet, “should be resigning, not seeking re-election.”\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, when asked by a reporter if he would support calls for Mrs. May’s resignation over the falling number of police officers, replied, “Indeed, I would.”\n\nStung by the criticism just days before a national election that will decide her political future, Mrs. May responded at a news conference. “We have protected counterterrorism policing budgets,” she said. “We have also provided funding for an increase in the number of armed police officers.”\n\nA focus on security would normally be expected to help the prospects of Mrs. May’s Tories in the approaching election. But as the investigation builds, so does speculation of potential security lapses that could have been prevented, possibly along with Saturday night’s attack.\n\nLate on Sunday, Mr. Corbyn criticized the decrease in the number of police officers since 2010. “You cannot protect the public on the cheap,” he said.\n\nThe total number of officers in England and Wales fell more than 19,500 from September 2010 to September 2016, according to the Home Office. Authorized firearms officers declined to 5,639 in March 2016 from 6,976 in March 2010.\n\nThe government says, however, that the number of armed officers is to increase by more than 1,000 in the next two years, that additional specialist teams are being set up outside London and that there will be 41 additional armed response vehicles.\n\nMr. Corbyn also accused the government of failing to publish a report, undertaken in early 2016, on foreign financing of extremist groups, for fear of upsetting foreign governments, although he himself is vulnerable on security issues.\n\nHe has demonstrated past support for Irish republicans and expressed doubts two years ago about a so-called shoot-to-kill policy for police officers during serious terrorist attacks.\n\nAlso on Monday, Mrs. May came to the defense of Mayor Sadiq Khan of London, who has been accused of being soft on terrorism by President Trump. Mrs. May said that she was working closely with the mayor and that he was doing “a good job,” adding, in answer to persistent questioning by reporters, that it was “wrong to say anything else.”\n\nMr. Khan, the first Muslim mayor of the British capital, had said after Saturday’s attack that Londoners should not be “alarmed” if they saw more police officers on the street. On Twitter on Sunday, Mr. Trump mischaracterized the quote to make it seem as if the mayor was telling his people not to be alarmed by terrorism; Mr. Khan’s office said that the “ill-informed tweet” deliberately took his remarks out of context.\n\nThe president fired back on Monday. “Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ‘no reason to be alarmed’ statement,” he wrote.\n\nOn Monday night, Mr. Khan led a brief vigil for the victims at Potters Fields Park, near the River Thames.\n\n“I want to send a clear message to the sick and evil extremists who commit these hideous crimes. We will defeat you,” he said, adding, “as a proud and patriotic Muslim I say this: You do not commit these acts in my name.”"],[10,"Arrests made as far-right and anti-fascist protesters clash in London (VIDEO) — RT UK News","Several people have been arrested when a march staged by the far-right English Defense League (EDL) was opposed by several counter-protests by anti-fascist groups resulting in clashes between rival protesters in central London.\n\nThe trouble began even before the EDL march, according to British media.\n\nSome scuffles were also later reported to have played out on the sidelines of the march despite the heavy police presence on the scene.\n\nRuptly footage shows one anti-fascist protester being floored by police after he attempted to attack a group of EDL supporters. The video also shows several anti-fascist activists being escorted to police vans.\n\nAn RT correspondent said both the EDL protest and the counterdemonstrations were “small in number” as between 40 and 50 people were shouting at each other, but that the demonstrators were “very emotional and every aggressive,” prompting police to take heavy security measures.\n\nThe EDL, a far-right street protest movement known for its anti-Islamic stance, staged its march in central London Saturday to call on authorities to do more against what they described as the “Islamic terror threat” in the UK.\n\nThe far-right group marched from Charing Cross to the Victoria embankment, where they staged a rally, between 13:00 and 14:30 GMT, British media report. Just dozens of people joined the far-right rally, some witnesses said on social media while the Express reported that the EDL turnout was “low.”\n\nDemonstrators were carrying EDL flags and placards that read: “No to Jihad!” “No more mosques!” and “No sharia!” Some of their banners urged the government to introduce stricter border controls and “defend the British borders.”\n\nTo counter the far-right activity, a demonstration organized by the Unite Against Fascism (UAF) movement was organized at Victoria Embankment between 12:30 and 15:00 GMT. A separate but similar themed anti-fascist rally was staged outside St Paul's Cathedral.\n\n“Never again!” “No to fascism!” and “Smash the English Defense League!” read some of the counter-protesters’ placards and banners. They were also chanting “Nazi scum!”\n\nHundreds of police officers were deployed on London’s streets to separate the far-right and anti-fascist camps and to prevent possible violence.\n\n“We have made the decision to impose conditions based on current tensions and concerns, information about the intentions of the organizers of these events and intelligence from previous marches held by similar groups,” police superintendent Emma Richards told reporters.\n\n“We have a duty to ensure that the community in central London can go about their daily business not unduly impacted by demonstrations taking place,” she added.\n\nSaturday’s protest action follows three high profile terrorist attacks that recently hit London and Manchester. Islamic State (IS, former ISIS/ISIL) have claimed responsibility for all three attacks. In the most recent terrorist related occurrence, a man drove through a group of Muslim worshippers near Finsbury Park Mosque in northern London. Police are treating the case as a far-right terrorist act."],[10,"'Sorry bruv, I don't know, I'm not a violent psychopath'","Muslim comedian Guz Khan has spoken out following the Manchester terror attack to offer an answer to the question – \"why do Muslims commit terror?\".\n\nIn a five-minute clip which was uploaded to YouTube, he speaks about the reaction Muslims faced following the Manchester Arena attack. The suicide attack killed 22 people, including children, after an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena on May 22.\n\nAsked by Double Down News, Guz, also known as Guzzy Bear, replied: \"If somebody was to ask me right now, excuse me, why do Muslims do such things like what took place in Manchester? My honest answer to you would be 'Sorry bruv, I don't know.\n\n\"Because I'm not a violent psychopath with murderous tendencies. You'd have to ask one of those people to find out why'.\"\n\nHe went on to explain that people still generally pushed the question as if he and other Muslims were the spokespeople for 1.6 billion people because of their faith.\n\nThe dad-of-three condemned what happened in Manchester saying: \"As a father, as an uncle, as a former teacher, when I heard what had happened in Manchester, I felt how any sane human being would. And that is I was disgusted. I was shook to my core really. Because it affected beautiful young children.\"\n\nWhile Khan believed that the whole country was united in that stance, he voiced his dismay that there were some on social media that had different views for children elsewhere.\n\nHighlighting that the majority of children affected by extremist groups such as Isis live in Iraq and Syria, he said people seemed to struggle to make the connection with them being so far away, illustrating this with a picture of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in September 2015 in the Mediterranean as his family were trying to reach Europe.\n\nHe also slammed the media for perpetuating messages of hate through its hunger for sensationalism and for giving platforms to the likes of Katie Hopkins and Anjem Choudary who he branded an \"opportunist\" and \"weirdo\" respectively.\n\nClaiming that he had previously been asked to use his own platform as a way to \"find jihadis\" within \"his\" community, he compared the ludicrous task to searching for the red and white stripe-wearing character in the Where's Wally books.\n\nHe said: \"Find Jihadis? I couldn't find where Wally was in that book let along find Jihadis in the community. What does this guy think, that there's a Muslim only version of Where's Wally called Where Walid? Yeah, really sweaty dude hiding behind a bin with a backpack. Page 89, there you go mate, terrorism solved\".\n\nThe Coventry-born star continued: \"I've been a Muslim a while and I can not get them to commit to what time we're going to go to Nandos let alone commit acts of terrorism.\"\n\nKhan concluded by urging people to embrace love not hate and called for the government to take responsibility for their part and tackle the issue head on with a new approach.\n\nHe explained: \"When you have huge government bodies greeting terror with purported terror, that only begets more terrorism. Jeremy Corbyn warned of this. Being one of only 13 MPs to vote against the military intervention in Libya.\"\n\nThe former humanities teacher quit his day job in 2015 to focus on comedy full-time after a clip he posted online joking that the film Jurassic World should be banned because of its racist references went viral.\n\nKhan is particularly known for his character Mobeen, a Muslim living in Small Heath, Birmingham, of which several videos can be viewed on the BBC iPlayer under the title British Muslim Comedy."],[10,"Arrest over London terror attack","Police investigating the terror attack at London Bridge, in which eight people died, have made another arrest.\n\nThe 29-year-old man was detained in Newham, east London - the 18th person to be arrest in the inquiry.\n\nIt brings the total number of people in custody to five.

Harun Rashid, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, agreed with Ms May and said: “We must listen to one another and work together to be part of a truly United Kingdom.”\n\nNational campaigning in the general election is expected to resume on Monday after being suspended by all the main parties, and voting will take place as planned on Thursday.\n\nCommuters in the capital were warned the exclusion zone around London Bridge station and the scene of the attack will remain in place on Monday."],[10,"One Love Manchester Concert","On Sunday 4th June, some of the biggest international names in music put on a show of solidarity for the victims and families affected by the terrible attack that happened at Manchester Arena on May 22nd.\n\nJustin Bieber, Coldplay, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Pharrell Williams, Usher, Take That and Niall Horan were among the stars joining Ariana Grande in a special benefit concert.

A child’s mind is very fragile and I don’t want her growing up to hate white people. She is half-white British herself and both she and I were born here.”\n\nIn another instance, a group of young people flagged down a man wearing a Muslim prayer cap as he drove along a street, telling him that he had a flat tyre.\n\nWhen the Muslim man got out his car to check, three people attacked him with a glass bottle, slicing his hand when he raised it to protect his face, and shouting that he was a terrorist.\n\nTell Mama said it was not unusual to see a surge in Islamophobic hate cases following a terrorist attack.\n\nWhen the soldier Lee Rigby was murdered in south-east London in 2013, the organisation saw an almost 400 per cent rise in hate case reports.\n\nIt saw an even greater rise following the terrorist attack in Paris in 2015, in which 130 people were killed in a series of coordinated attacks across the city.\n\nCommenting on the surge in hate cases, Tell Mama’s director, Iman Atta, told The Sunday Times: “Obviously, people are angry and they should rightly be.\n\n“That anger, though, should be targeted at countering and challenging extremism where people see it, instead of against innocent citizens who happen to be Muslim.”"],[10,"Bear locks himself in car, honks horn awakening owners","The black bear started honking the horn before 5 a.m. (Source: Pixabay)\n\n(RNN) - A 200-pound black bear opened the door to a vehicle, locked himself in and then honked the horn trying to get out, rousting the car’s owners from their beds early Thursday. \n\nRoanoke County, VA, police responded to a 5 a.m. call from homeowners awakened by the bear laying on the horn of their vehicle.    \n\n“The baby bear found some treats inside and caused minor damage to the vehicle.

Amazing\". It is actually a widely debunked hoax made in 2014 by Norwegian director with actors in Malta. The video has 172,000 views on Britain First's Facebook page and has not been taken down. On 22 April, Britain First posted a link to a video showing Muslims attacking and abducting a young woman. The Press Association found that it actually shows footage of a suspected drug dealer being arrested by police in France back in 2015. Deputy leader Jayda Fransen also posted a link to the video on Twitter. Another popular video on Facebook was claimed to show a \"huge crowd of migrant Muslims\" attacking German police, but actually shows an anti-fascist demonstration from 2011. The video was reshared by Britain First's followers more than 2,500 times and remains on the platform with 142,000 views. In another video viewed 104,000 times on Facebook, captioned \"Poor woman assaulted by migrants in Austria!\", the CCTV footage can be traced back to an attack in the Czech Republic last year. Media reports from the country make no mention of the attackers being migrants. Another post is entitled \"Muslim migrants in Australia thought they are above the law!\" - with a link to a YouTube video shared hundreds of times by followers of the group's Facebook page. Though the man featured in the video appears to lash out at police, when contacted he told the Press Association he was actually born in Australia. A video posted on Twitter by Britain First leader Paul Golding was alleged to show migrants in Europe attacking a woman – the footage was actually of a mugging carried out by children on a woman in Brazil.\n\nA significant number of comments \"glorifying\" the Finsbury Park attack have also been made by Britain First followers on the party's Facebook page.\n\nAfter the group posted news of Monday's attack, one user wrote: \"Well done that man.\"\n\nAnother added, \"If only we had a million heroes like this!\" while a third wrote, \"Good on him wish more would follow suit.\"\n\nA stream of similar comments in praise of the attack followed.\n\nGolding, a former BNP activist, has long been accused of causing unrest in British Muslim communities.\n\nWhile his party insists it holds peaceful protests, its marches often result in clashes with local residents or anti-fascist campaigners.\n\nGolding, 35, was recently released from prison following an incident outside a mosque in Cardiff, and in November last year, deputy leader Fransen was convicted of religious harassment after she hurled abuse at a Muslim woman for wearing a hijab during a march through Luton.\n\nThe two party leaders were arrested again last month following another anti-Islam campaign which related to an ongoing rape trial in Kent.\n\nBritain First and social media\n\nBritain First's Facebook page has more than 1.7 million followers, which is more than the Conservative, Labour and the Lib Dem parties have combined.\n\nTheir Twitter following, however, is smaller: their unverified @BritainFirstHQ account has about 14,000 followers; leader Golding has just under 31,000; and deputy leader Fransen has around 35,000.\n\nFransen and Golding almost exclusively tweet anti-Islam and anti-immigration material.\n\nThe party told IBTimes UK it condemned Monday's attack.

That man was later pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nOsborne was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and terrorism offences. Police currently believe he acted alone.\n\nFurther details of Osborne's movements in the days leading up to the attack have since emerged in media reports, including claims that he had been thrown out of his local pub in Cardiff the night before having been \"cursing Muslims and saying he would do some damage.\"\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May visited Finsbury Park at lunchtime on Monday and described the incident as \"every bit as insidious and destructive to our values and our way of life\" as the recent string of terror attacks in London and Manchester.\n\nShe repeated comments she made after the London Bridge attacks earlier this month, vowing to \"stamp out extremist and hateful ideology – both across society and on the internet – so it is denied a safe space to grow.\"\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was also at the scene on Monday, said: \"A lot of the time people are saying Islamophobia isn't real.

If we don’t get smart it will only get worse,” Trump said.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for the London mayor said Khan “is busy working with the police, emergency services and the government to coordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack.”\n\n“He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump’s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police - including armed officers - on the streets,” the spokesperson said.\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” program, said he thought Trump’s tweet misrepresented what the mayor had said.\n\n“I don’t think that a major terrorist attack like this is the time to be divisive and to criticize a mayor who’s trying to organize his city’s response to this attack,” Gore, a Democrat, said.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Democrat and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN that it “troubles” him to see the kinds of tweets Trump has put out in the aftermath of the London attacks.\n\n‘EVIL SLAUGHTER’\n\nTrump did not mention the mayor when speaking after a gala event at Washington’s Ford’s Theatre later on Sunday, where he condemned the attacks as an “evil slaughter.”\n\nHe said the United States would do everything in its power to assist the UK in bringing those responsible to justice.\n\n“This bloodshed must end. This bloodshed will end,” Trump said, adding he would “do what is necessary” to prevent the threat from reaching the United States.\n\nIslamic State on Sunday claimed responsibility for the London attack.\n\nTrump also spoke with British Prime Minister Theresa May to offer condolences and offered Washington’s “full support,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump cited the London attacks to push his March 6 executive order that would temporarily ban entry into the United States of people from six predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe ban has been blocked in the courts and Trump’s legal team has asked the Supreme Court to reinstate it.\n\nTrump has said the travel ban is needed to protect Americans from terrorist attacks.

if he would of, we could have done something to stop that happening.”\n\nAbz claimed his cousin never “admitted extremist views” but alluded to “political opinions”, adding: “It wasn't focused or aimed at a particular group.\n\n”The thought was he was just a religious man taking it way too far, becoming judgemental maybe.\n\n“There's never been a hint of extremism.”\n\nBut there are questions about Abz’ own statements on social media, where he reportedly once wrote: “If only Hitler was still alive - these Jews would be burnt in chambers.”\n\nThat post has apparently been deleted, but other Twitter rants remain, including one calling Manchester his “no.1 enemy”, adding: “I f***ing hate the s***hole.”\n\nIn a series of posts on a page naming his Fade’away barber shop, Abz claimed England was “sucking his money in every way”, adding: “Hope it gets bankrupt soon and starts licking Africa's ass.”\n\nHe and Isaac, whose younger brother Alharth, remains in custody, suggested their cousin may have been radicalised abroad, but sources with knowledge of the investigation say the opposite.\n\nThey believe that Abedi developed extremist beliefs while in Manchester, but that the violence he was exposed to during the Libyan civil war was a key part of the path to launching the attack.\n\nHis parents sought refuge in the UK because of links to anti-Gaddafi groups including the banned Libyan Islamic Fighting Group.\n\nWhen the civil war broke out in 2011, they and many other Libyans returned to fight the regime, although it is unclear whether Abedi and his brother were on the frontlines.\n\nThe 22-year-old had a “relatively minor” criminal record as a teenager but was not known to police for holding extremist views, appearing on police logs in 2012 over offences of theft, receiving stolen goods and assault.\n\nAbedi’s acquaintances said he was previously linked to gangs, smoked cannabis and drankbut came back from Libya a “completely different guy” six years ago and “suddenly turned religious”. \n\nThe same transformation has been documented in many of Europe’s deadliest terrorists, including petty criminals and drug dealers in the Isis “super cell” behind the Paris and Brussels attacks.\n\nAbedi expressed extremist sentiments, hung a black Islamist flag from his home, reportedly told friends at college “being a suicide bomber was okay” and began referring to Brits as “infidels” who were “unjust to Arabs”.\n\nHis family claimed they warned authorities he was “dangerous”, moving him and his younger brother to Libya in April to keep a closer eye, months after Abedi dropped out of his business degree at Salford University.\n\nInconsistencies have emerged in original accounts given by community leaders, who said two people had raised concerns about Abedi with separate calls to an anti-terror hotline.\n\nBut the Metropolitan Police said it had so far found no record of any calls to the dedicated line about Abedi.\n\nHe was known to MI5, which has launched an internal review amid reports it was warned about Abedi's plans, but was not known to Prevent, the Government's voluntary counter-radicalisation scheme.\n\nPolice are attempting to piece together the bomber's movements from when he flew back from Libya on 18 May and the attack four days later.\n\nNew CCTV images have been released showing Abedi moving around Manchester during the period, sometimes carrying a blue suitcase investigators also want to trace.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call the anti-terror hotline anonymously on 0800 789321 or send images and footage to police by visiting the UK Police Image Appeal website."],[10,"London attack: Seven killed in vehicle and stabbing incidents","Seven people have been killed and at least 48 injured in a terror incident in London in which three male attackers were shot dead by police.\n\nA white van hit pedestrians on London Bridge at about 22:00 BST on Saturday, then three men got out and stabbed people in nearby Borough Market.\n\nPolice said the three men were wearing fake bomb vests.\n\nOne of those hurt is a police officer who was stabbed after going to help.

A large proportion of those have involved suspects who set out to commit acts of violence similar to the attack on Westminster Bridge and London Bridge.\n\nPlans to use bombs, such as at Manchester Arena, are rarer because plotters need to have the technical skills for such an appalling attack - but attacking people with cars and knives is far easier and has long been encouraged by so-called Islamic State and other jihadists.\n\nThe aim of the three attackers last night is abundantly clear - not only did they want to kill, but they almost wanted to lose their own lives.\n\nThey would've known full well that attacking people in the street would draw armed police in their direction and the fake bomb belts they were wearing would, in their own warped minds, hasten their demise.\n\nA bomb disposal team was later called to Borough Market and local residents told to leave their homes.\n\nEyewitness Will Orton, who was also in a pub close to the scene, said: \"The bouncers did a really good job, they shut the doors and locked everyone in.\n\n\"There was panic - it seemed like it was literally outside the door.\"\n\nVilwar Hussein helped carry the injured police officer to nearby Guy's hospital and recalled seeing a wound in his chest \"and blood everywhere\".\n\nEarlier, Vilwar said he'd seen the white van perform a U-turn on London Bridge before driving back southwards along the pavement.\n\nLondon Bridge and neighbouring Southwark Bridge are both closed along with many other roads including Borough High Street and Lower Thames Street.\n\nTrains are not stopping at London Bridge station.\n\nFacebook has activated its safety check so people in London could post a message to let friends and relatives know they were safe.\n\nThe police are asking anyone with photographs or videos of the incident to upload them here."],[10,"IMWS Chair responding to the terrorist attack in Finsbury Park","by Mohammad\n\nRespondingto the Finsbury Park Masjid (mosque) terror attack the Chair of Indian Muslim Welfare Society (IMWS), Saied Laher, said: \n\n“Once again we were horrified to hear of another terror attack in the capital which has already claimed one life and left another ten in hospital receiving treatment.\n\n“Our thoughts are with the victims and their families and offer our sincere condolences to those that have been affected by this atrocious act of terrorism.\n\n“We pray that this attack on innocent people in the holy month of Ramadhaan does not cause further division and separation,  but instead unite the good and law abiding people across the nation to stand together  against the vile hate that lead to this senseless act of terror and murder.\n\n“Acts of terrorism have no colour, race or faith.

If he wants to write things down I’ll give him a pen and a pad of paper.

Three attackers who appeared to be wearing suicide belts were shot dead within eight minutes of the first call to emergency services, the police said on Sunday.\n\nAs firearms officers confronted the assailants, firing about 50 rounds at them, a member of the public was wounded, police said.\n\nLondon Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner, Mark Rowley, said the officers had been faced with a “life and death” situation in which people had been killed and had needed to fire heavily to be sure they had “neutralised those threats”.\n\nHe said police had made “significant progress” in identifying the attackers and were working on whether they were assisted by anyone else. Earlier on Sunday, 12 people were arrested in the east London area of Barking. Some 36 people remain in hospital following the attack, 21 of them in a critical condition.\n\nSpeaking outside Downing Street on Sunday morning, the Prime Minister foreshadowed tougher action. “We cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are. Things need to change,” Mrs May said. “It is time to say enough is enough.”\n\nShe called the threat from radical Islamism “one of the great challenges of our time”, and warned there was “far too much tolerance of extremism in our country”.\n\nIn light of the changing threat, Mrs May said a review was needed of Britain’s current counter-terrorism strategy to “make sure the police and security services have all the powers they need”. She also called for tighter regulation of the internet to deny extremist ideology the “safe space it needs to breed”.\n\nThe attack began on London Bridge and ended at Borough Market, a popular restaurant and bar area on the south side of the Thames river.\n\nOn Sunday morning the area was still cordoned off and motorists and pedestrians were being turned back as police continued to search buildings. Cressida Dick, Metropolitan Police commissioner, said it was a “complex and confused scene, and a confused series of events”.\n\nThe incident comes less than a fortnight after Salman Abedi, a suicide bomber, killed himself and 22 others in an explosion after a concert at the Manchester Arena on May 22.\n\nIt also comes less than a week before the UK’s general election on Thursday and less than three months after a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge and the UK parliament.\n\nApart from the recent attacks, the prime minister said the security services and police had foiled five credible terrorist threats since the Westminster incident.\n\nElection campaigning was suspended on Sunday, for a second time, and Mrs May called a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. However, the prime minister said on Sunday that the election would be held on June 8 as planned.\n\nCommander Dick said that police had been called at 10.08pm on Saturday to reports that a vehicle had struck pedestrians on London Bridge. The suspects then left the vehicle in the Borough Market area and stabbed a “number of people”, the Met chief said. The suspects were confronted and shot by police at Borough Market.\n\n“We have witness reports of three people armed with knives and three attackers. And we believe the threat that they posed was neutralised within eight minutes. We don’t believe there is [any attacker outstanding] but we must make absolutely certain.”\n\nMark Rowley, deputy commissioner of London’s Metropolitan Police, said officers had initially been called to an incident involving a van hitting pedestrians on London Bridge. Witnesses described a van veering at high speed into passers-by.\n\nMr Rowley said the van continued on to the nearby crowded Borough Market. “The suspects then left the vehicle and a number of people were stabbed, including an on-duty British transport police officer who was responding to the incident at London Bridge,” Mr Rowley said. “He received serious but not life-threatening injuries.\n\n“Armed officers responded very quickly and bravely, confronting three male suspects who were shot and killed in Borough Market,” he confirmed. “The suspects were wearing what looked like explosive vests but these were later established to be hoaxes.” \n\nA third incident, in Vauxhall, that had initially been linked with the first two was subsequently declared unrelated.\n\nThe London Ambulance Service said it had taken 48 wounded to five hospitals across London following the incidents, as well as treating a number of people at the scene for less serious injuries.\n\nLoud explosions were heard in the early hours of Sunday morning from the Financial Times’ offices, near Borough Market. Numerous witnesses said they heard gunfire as police responded to news of the attack.\n\nThe security operation was carried out amid chaotic scenes as streets throughout south London were filled with speeding police vehicles, ambulances and fire engines. The area immediately around Borough Market was full of confused people who had been evacuated from the scenes of the incidents. Lifeboats helped to transport some people away from the riverside area.\n\nSadiq Khan, London’s mayor, called the incident a “deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners and visitors” to the city enjoying their Saturday night.\n\nThe attack bears similarities to the incident on March 22, in which Khalid Masood killed five people in Westminster by driving a car down a pavement and then attacking with a knife a police officer guarding the Houses of Parliament.\n\nWill Heaven, managing editor of the Spectator magazine, who was travelling in a private-hire vehicle south over London Bridge just afterwards, said he noticed someone on the ground “in a really bad way”.\n\nThe UK was already on high terrorism alert after the Manchester Arena bombing and the attack in Westminster. This Thursday’s general election poses its own logistical challenges for the security services.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour party, called the incidents in London “brutal and shocking”.\n\n“My thoughts are with the victims and their families,” he wrote. “Thank you to the emergency services.”\n\nIn a flurry of tweets sent after the attack, US President Donald Trump used the incident to renew demands for the courts to stop blocking his travel ban on visitors from several Muslim countries coming to the US.\n\nThe President later said the US was “with the UK” and the White House subsequently issued a statement to confirm that Mr Trump had spoken to Mrs May and offered his condolences for the “brutal terror attacks”.\n\nOn Sunday morning US time, Mr Trump criticised London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, in a later tweet, saying: “At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed’!”\n\nThis appeared to be a reference to comments the Mayor made on Sunday morning seeking to reassure people about the heightened security presence on the capital’s streets.\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor said Mr Khan would not be responding to the president.\n\n“He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump’s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police — including armed officers — on the streets,” she said in an emailed statement.\n\nMr Khan said on Saturday night that the “deliberate and cowardly attack” on London Bridge was a “barbaric” act.\n\nIn a statement, the Muslim Council of Britain said: “Muslims everywhere are outraged and disgusted at these cowards who once again have destroyed the lives of our fellow Britons. That this should happen in this month of Ramadan, when many Muslims were praying and fasting only goes to show that these people respect neither life nor faith.”"],[10,"Two bombings in Manchester, 21 years apart, show the changing nature of terrorism","An explosion hit a crowded music venue in Manchester on Monday night, killing at least 22 people and wounding  many more at a concert attended by many children and their parents. The Islamic State has since claimed responsibility for what Prime Minister Theresa May described as a “callous terrorist attack” in what is often referred to as Britain's “second city.”\n\nThe attack, an apparent suicide bombing, is believed to be the worst terrorist strike on British soil since 2005, when London's public transport network was hit by a number of bombs that left 54 people dead.\n\nThough this is the first terrorist attack to hit the city in years, Manchester is already a city marked by terrorism. The historically industrial, largely working-class city was the target of a number of bombings from the 1970s onward. These attacks were orchestrated not by the Islamist extremists who claimed more modern attacks in Britain, but by the Provisional Irish Republican Army that sought to pressure the British government into accepting a united and independent Ireland.\n\nThe most famous of these attacks occurred almost 21 years ago, on the morning of June 15, 1996. The IRA detonated a 3,300-pound truck bomb on Corporation Street in the commercial center of the city, not far from Monday night's attack at the Manchester Arena. It is still the largest bomb to explode in Britain since World War II.\n\nIn some ways, the response to the 1996 bombing wasn't so different than the 2017 attack. This Tuesday, the Arndale Centre shopping mall that bore the brunt of the Corporation Street bombing was evacuated again after fears that it might be targeted in a follow-up attack. Again, there are fears that an attack outside Britain's capital appears to have stretched the country's often London-focused intelligence community.\n\nMay also appears to have inadvertently mirrored the language of then-Prime Minister John Major, who called the attack a “callous act of terrorism” in a statement released in 1996. Major had dubbed the 1996 bombing the work of “a few fanatics” and said that the attack caused “absolute revulsion” in Ireland. Colin Phillips, a senior Manchester police officer who spoke to reporters after the attack, dubbed the IRA “absolutely evil criminals” for the plot — a statement that finds its own echo in President Trump's criticism of the “evil losers” behind such attacks.\n\nIf Monday night's attack is proven to have links to Islamist extremists, there will be more parallels. Manchester is home to a large Muslim community. Mancunian Muslims may now find themselves expected to publicly express  opposition to an act of terror or risk guilt by association, much like the city's sizable Irish population did in 1996. Accounts of the aftermath of the IRA bombing tell of how Irish nurses were told to go “home” by colleagues, and Irish community centers received violent threats. A local politician soon set up an Irish festival to try to bridge the divides wrought by the attack.\n\nDespite the similarities, the differences between the two attacks shows how the threat posed by terrorism has shifted in the past two decades. The attack at the Manchester Arena appears designed to inflict the maximum amount  of deaths and injuries on  a primarily young crowd, there to enjoy the music of American singer Ariana Grande. While the 1996 attack caused far greater damage to Manchester's buildings and saw more than 200 people wounded, no one died in the immediate aftermath of the attack.\n\nThis is in large part due to phone calls to local television stations and universities placed on the morning of June 15. Just an hour before the bomb went off, an Irish-accented man warned that there was a bomb  in a van parked on the corner of Cannon  and Corporation streets. The caller used a code word that let authorities know it was a real threat. Police sprang into action, evacuating around 80,000 people from the busy commercial hub of one of Europe's larger cities. By the time the bomb went off, only a handful of people were still in the area.\n\nThe warning was a deliberate tactic. While terrorist experts note that the lack of fatalities was pure luck given the enormous size of the blast (a local security guard did eventually die of an asbestos-related illness that has been blamed on the bombings), the IRA was not primarily interested in causing deaths and injuries. Instead, their hope was to strike Britain's economic centers to wear down London's commitment to Northern Ireland. The economic damage caused to Manchester by the 1996 bombing was substantial: Much of the city center lay in ruins after the attack, with the economic cost reported to have been £700 million ($917 million at current exchange rates).\n\nIn fact, the IRA understood that any deaths caused by the blast could end up being counterproductive to its cause. When the IRA released a statement claiming responsibility for the attack  June 20, the organization said it “sincerely regretted” the injuries caused to civilians.\n\nMuch remains to be discovered about the perpetrator of this week's attack in Manchester. In particular, there will be a lot of interest in the ties between the suspect, who died in the attack, and the Islamic State. In the past, the extremist organization has claimed attacks for which it seemed to have no practical input other than inspiration. This loose relationship with potential attackers presents a confounding problem for intelligence agencies.\n\nThe men who planted the bomb in Manchester in 1996 have never been found, despite considerable leads at the time. The attack may well have led back to the IRA's leadership, but the drive to find the perpetrators ended up coinciding with a renewed push for peace in Northern Ireland. Less than two years after the attack, the Good Friday peace agreement was signed. The deal ultimately saw the IRA give up using terrorist tactics in its struggle for a united Ireland, though there still remains dissension on the group's fringes.\n\nDespite the damage wrought on the city in 1996, some now credit the attack with the rebirth of Manchester — a former manufacturing hub that had fallen into a slump after World War II and had become known as a gloomy, poor city. Development had long been planned in the city, but the huge amount of damage in Manchester's once-drab center presented a historic opportunity to wipe the slate clean and create a gleaming, steel- and glass-filled commercial hub. The city is now well-known internationally for its sports teams, multiple universities and arts and culture.\n\nBut the city never forgot the attack. A red post box, one of the few objects left standing after the bomb, still sits on Corporation Street. It bears a gold plaque commemorating the blast from almost 21 years ago.\n\nMore on WorldViews:"],[10,"Jeremy Corbyn joins calls for Theresa May to resign over police cuts in wake of serial terror attacks [VIDEO]","Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has joined calls for Theresa May to resign over the police cuts which took 20,000 police officers off the streets prior to a series of terror attacks on UK soil.\n\nSince May became Home Secretary in 2010, she has delivered major cuts to police forces across the country. And as a result, there are now 20,000 fewer police officers in the UK than there were in 2009. That is a 14% drop in less than a decade.\n\nA briefing from the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners states that planned budget cuts will hurt even more. Its analysis suggests that police staffing levels could fall by a further 17% to approximately 100,000 by 2020 – the lowest level since the mid-1970s. The government will also cull civilian posts, requiring remaining officers to fulfil back office roles too.\n\nYet, in the wake of the third terror attack on UK soil in three months, the Prime Minister is continuing to insist that these cuts never happened. This led to the unprecedented intervention of a former Senior Investigation Officer from the Metropolitan Police, Peter Kirkham. During an interview with Sky News on Sunday 4 June, Kirkham accused May of outright “lying” to the public about the London attacks. Towards the end of the exchange on Sky News, the interviewer asked:\n\nKirkham responded:\n\nKirkham’s decision to break ranks has triggered an avalanche of support from others. High profile leaders from across political and security circles are today calling for Theresa May to resign over her police cuts. David Cameron’s former Director of Strategy Steve Hilton, who worked for Cameron in the coalition government, took to Twitter on Monday 5 June to call for May to quit. He said:\n\nTheresa May responsible for security failures of London Bridge, Manchester, Westminster Bridge. Should be resigning not seeking re-election… She is more responsible for UK’s current security set-up – and its failures – than anyone else… who is in the end politically responsible/accountable? she was in charge last 7yrs [sic]…  I think her spin and carefully crafted language masks the reality that she doesn’t know what she is doing…\n\nIn an interview with ITV News, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was asked if he would back the calls for May to quit. He responded:\n\nIndeed I would, because there’s been calls made by a lot of very responsible people on this who are very worried that she was at the Home Office for all this time, presided over these cuts in police numbers and is now saying that we have a problem – yes, we do have a problem, we should never have cut the police numbers.\n\nAt a campaign event in London, the Prime Minister continued to deny the cuts had happened at all, saying:\n\nHowever, her own Culture Secretary was saying the opposite in media interviews. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley was repeatedly pressed on police numbers in an interview for Good Morning Britain. Her attempts to avoid answering immediately went viral.\n\nIn a later interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Bradley was forced to admit that: “We’ve seen reductions in police numbers across the board”. She added: “We had to take difficult decisions in 2010 when we came into office. When as you remember there was no money.”\n\nBradley argues that there “was no money” for the police and security services since 2010. Yet, the Conservative government has been providing an annual taxpayer handout to corporations of £93bn a year since coming into office. That’s more than the annual cost of the entire education system (£59.2bn), all housing-related benefits (£27bn) and unemployment benefits (£3bn) combined.\n\nTheresa May is right when she says ‘enough is enough’. This country has certainly had enough of being told that there is no magic money tree for critical public services – even police and counter-terrorism. When all the while, the Conservative government is shaking the taxpayer piggy bank to shower every last penny on already-wealthy individuals and corporations in corporate welfare. If May fails to resign over this failure, the public can always sack her themselves on Thursday 8 June.\n\nGet Involved!\n\n– If you are concerned about friends or family in London, call the Met Police Casualty Unit on 0800 096 1233 or 020 7158 0197.\n\nFeatured image via YouTube/YouTube"],[10,"Dogs Die In Hot Cars Warning: Your Rights And Actions If You See A Dog In A Car","Please also remember that the same applies in conservatories and caravans – these are not suitable for dogs to be left in when the weather is warm.

She also helped raise another £2m during the three hours of the concert alone.\n\nIt could so easily have been maudlin, but was not. The concert was heartfelt, joyful, even defiant. It was, as Grande said tearfully, “light, and filled with fun, love and bright energy”. Dressed in a sweatshirt and stilettos, the 23-year-old hosted rather than headlined, with deep feeling and sensitivity.\n\nWhile there was an affecting power in seeing Liam Gallagher bury the hatchet with Chris Martin, having fired amusing scorn at him for years, the really impressive sight was Grande being able to unite a city she has rarely visited before, let alone define it, as Gallagher has done in the past.\n\nGrande’s setlist had undergone a last-minute change the day before after she met the mother of 15-year-old Olivia Campbell, a victim of the Manchester Arena attack. “She said that I should stop crying as Olivia wouldn’t have wanted me to cry. And then she told me that Olivia would have wanted to hear the hits,” the singer said.\n\nWith that, laughing through tears, Grande launched into Side to Side, her hit single about soreness after sex.\n\nThe cheeky reggae-pop number might not have been the obvious choice, but its 11th-hour inclusion spoke to a refusal to be cowed, which characterised the mood of the concert. With thousands of voices joining in, the chorus “been there all night and boy got me walking side to side” sounded positively triumphant. “No better two fingers to Isis,” one person tweeted.\n\nIt was completely in keeping with the defiant expression of a Londoner interviewed after the London Bridge attack on Saturday: “If me having a gin and tonic with my friends, flirting with handsome men, hanging out with brilliant women, is what offends these people so much, I’m going to do it more, not less.”\n\nOther songs that over time and through oversaturation have become background music – Fix You, Roar, Don’t Look Back in Anger, Live Forever, Viva La Vida, Angels – assumed their full potency. The setlist was a reminder that these tracks are there when you need them.\n\nThis was a concert, like Live Aid and others before it, which showed how uniquely powerful pop music is, a sonic space where emotions are expressed, processed and worked through. The emotional breadth of pop is often misread as shallow or glib, but events such as this show how valuable its open-heartedness is to so many people.\n\nA case in point is The Black Eyed Peas song Where Is The Love?, which when heard on the radio can seem a bit trite in its appeal for pan-global understanding, but in this context chimed perfectly with the need for clear, emphatic statements following trauma.\n\nGrande’s colossal empathy only magnified the song’s message further. “I think the kind of love and unity we’re displaying is the medicine that the world really needs right now,” she said. The screams that greeted her performance were uplifting in themselves, unhinged teenage excitement that remained unbowed by the attack. Where previously artists such as Bono and Martin have taken on the role of pop healers, Grande showed she shared their talent for pan-generational unity.\n\nIt was impossible not to be moved by her unaffected duet with Miley Cyrus of Don’t Dream It’s Over by Crowded House, or the all-star rendition of her 2015 song One Last Time, adopted by fans as an anthem after the attack. Grande closed the show on stage alone, with a sparse, emotional cover of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\n\nInitially a cookie-cutter tween pop star, Grande has impressively wrested back her career. She has created a witty and forthright kind of R&B pop, and showed herself to be socially engaged, with numerous feminist statements including a much-shared tract on Twitter calling out double standards. Her conduct after the attack, bringing together this concert and hosting it with such elan, further underscores her maturity.\n\nHer manager, Scooter Braun, recounted on stage a conversation he had with Grande a week ago in which she said she would have been unable to live with herself had she not recognised the victims in some way. With One Love, Grande rose to the occasion with heart, strength and moments of out-of-body levity that can only come from a big pop show.\n\nScenes posted on social media showed strangers filing out of the venue together singing Wonderwall and Angels, a testament to the power of pop music as a symbol of strength, unity and normalcy.

Shocking.\n\n650 police officers cut from Merseyside.\n\n750 from Wales.\n\n1,200 from the West Midlands.\n\nNearly 2,000 officers from the Met.\n\nRight across the country 16,000 police officers lost.\n\nThat is a reckless risk to take with the fight against crime.\n\nTheresa May says they will all come from the back office.\n\nBut the truth is they are putting officers back in the back office, because the back office itself has been so heavily cut.\n\nThe staff members that Unison represent, who do the jobs that keep constables out on the streets, too often taken for granted - thousands of them have already gone.\n\nLABOUR RESOURCES\n\nConference, the police do have to make their fair share of cuts.\n\nWe said 12 per cent budget cuts - based on independent advice on what the police need to protect the front line.\n\nThat's £1bn over the Parliament. But the government's gone for £2bn in cuts. With the steepest cuts in the first two years. We've said it before; It's too far too fast and it's communities that will pay the price.\n\nAnd here's the reality of what those cuts mean. You may have seen his story in all the papers.\n\nSergeant Kevin Brooks has worked for South Wales police for many years.\n\nThis summer he won a police bravery award after tackling a criminal who deliberately rammed a patrol car with his 4x4, at risk of crushing an officer to death.\n\nThe Prime Minster invited him to Downing Street. Posed for a photo with him.\n\nOnly days later, back in South Wales, PC Brooks lost his job because of the cuts.\n\nNow we see a British Prime Minister, a Tory Prime Minister, handing P45s to crime fighting heroes.\n\nHe shouldn't be sacking the police, he should be backing the police.\n\nRIOTS AND POLICE NUMBERS\n\nAnd how can they turn a blind eye to the evidence from the riots this summer.\n\nFor four nights thousands of people took to the streets to loot and to pillage.\n\nBurning police cars, looting shops and torching homes.\n\nPutting people's lives as well as livelihoods at risk.\n\nThis country must never again tolerate such lawlessness. Never again should criminals be allowed take control of the streets, and they cannot be allowed to get away with it.\n\nBut it took 16,000 officers to quell the madness on London streets - officers from Norfolk, South Wales, Hampshire, Cumbria, all joining the Met to bring the streets back under control.\n\n16,000 officers.\n\nConference, that's the same number of officers David Cameron now wants to cut.\n\nHow out of touch can you get?\n\nPolice numbers matter. You don't cut crime by cutting the police.\n\nConference we need enough police. And we need the police to do a good job.\n\nLabour introduced important reforms- Neighbourhood policing to get police out of their cars and onto the beat.- Changing the law to make police, councils, youth services, probation all work together in partnership to prevent crime.\n\nWe need to go further. But what do we get from Theresa May and David Cameron?\n\nChaos and confusion.\n\nThey promise less bureaucracy but they increase the forms officers have to fill.\n\nThey promise to professionalise the service, but then abolish the training to deliver it.\n\nBreathless promises this summer to send in the army. Troops on the streets of Britain.\n\nPrime Minister, you don't need to bring in the Army if you have enough police.\n\nWe need further reform right across the criminal justice system.\n\nSadiq Khan's plans he set out this morning, more support for victims, a new victims law.\n\nAnd on policing what the Police Federation and the Superintendants Association have called for is right. Now is the time for a serious vision for the future of policing -- a Royal Commission or heavyweight independent review.\n\nThe government has refused to do so. So we will.\n\nWe are setting up an independent review to look at the crime challenges of the 21st century and how policing needs to adapt and respond.\n\nBuilding on the best of British and international policing. Vigorous and challenging on the changes needed.\n\nWorking with the police not trying to undermine them.\n\nIt will be led by someone who started as a beat officer in London and rose to be the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.\n\nI am grateful to the much respected Lord John Stevens for agreeing to chair this important independent review.\n\nConference.\n\nNext week at the Tory Party conference, we'll hear a lot of tough talk from David Cameron about broken Britain, cracking down on crime and gangs.\n\nTough talk from a Prime Minister who is still cutting the police, still cutting police powers, still pushing up unemployment and has barely mentioned crime since he started in the job.\n\nHe says it now. He hasn't done it before.\n\nPrime Minister. It shouldn't take a riot.\n\nConference, the police need strong powers to cut crime - alongside strong checks and balances to guard against abuse.\n\nBut behind the rhetoric the Tories are making it harder for the police to do their job:- making it harder for the councils to use CCTV.- abolishing ASBOs, replacing them with weak injunctions the police can't enforce.- voting to water down counter-terror powers so we can't ban terror suspects from London in Olympic year.\n\nAnd Conference, this is the Tory government that wants to slash the DNA database despite the fact that it helped catch rioters, and it helps solve thousands of crimes each year. In ten days time they plan to vote to take 17,000 suspected rapists off the database, despite the evidence from the police and Rape Crisis that this will make it even harder to bring rapists to justice and prevent this horrible crime.\n\nThe Tories are hoping David Cameron is moving to the right on law and order.\n\nHe isn't moving right, he's just getting it wrong.\n\nConference, what we saw in the riots, the police see in their cells every night.\n\nSome people who are out of control, a danger to others and often to themselves.\n\nThe carelessness and the anger, the hopelessness and the indifference. People who think they have nothing to lose and nothing better to aspire to.\n\nThat doesn't mean the whole of society is broken or sick.\n\nThe thousands of people who stood up in our cities with brooms not batons aren't sick. The community leaders who calmed the tensions in Birmingham aren't broken. People like Tariq Jahan who lost his son yet spoke for peace. These are the communities who stand against violence, the heroes of a strong society.\n\nBehind the thin blue line stands not just thousands of police officers but millions of British people who believe the law should be respected, and that we have obligations to each other.\n\nCrime doesn't prove society is broken, it shows society needs to be stronger.\n\nIn Labour's years crime fell and fewer young people fell into crime. The number of young offenders fell by a third compared to the legacy the Tories left us with in 1997.\n\nBut we know there are still too many people who are out of control, going off the rails and no one drags them back. Still problem families handing down violence rather than values across the generations.\n\nOur answer should be to build stronger communities. As Labour Lambeth Council is doing, giving the community control of the youth service, the work to tackle gangs and support parenting.\n\nIn the words of Carl Lokko, one of the young people involved, \"we are more determined to make change happen because we don't want to bury any more of our friends\".\n\nI want them to be able to do more.\n\nMore action against gangs like in Boston or in Hackney where the police and council target gang members and confront them with the choice - get out of gangs and we will help you build a better future or face the full force of the law.\n\nMore action like Citizens UK working with businesses and cafes on our city streets who will act as safe havens young people can retreat to, to stay safe from knife crimes or bullying by gangs.\n\nThe government says we can't afford to.\n\nCommunities across the country know we can't afford not to.\n\nThe taxpayer now has to pay out hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation to the businesses and families hit by riots.\n\nFar better to stop it happening in the first place.\n\nAnd don't forget they can find cash for their priorities.\n\nNext year, in Olympic year, the government will spend over £100m electing politicians on £120,000 a year to become crime chiefs. Yet they are cutting thousands and thousands of police.\n\nBut this is the year when the eyes of the world are upon us. Our great Olympic opportunity. But we cannot have a repeat of this summer's shameful violence and disorder.\n\nSo the Government should rethink. They should stop the plans for over 40 crime chiefs.\n\nUse that cash this year to put in place strong action on gangs as Boston, Hackney and Lambeth are doing.\n\nUse that cash to stop 2,000 Police Constables being cut in Olympic year.\n\nBut instead of taking action to build a stronger society and cut crime, this Government is washing its hands and making it worse.\n\nGang prevention work in Tottenham has been cut.\n\nParent support through Sure Start is being closed down.\n\nInstead of requiring young people to work - with jobs for them to go to through the Future Jobs Fund - the government has pushed youth unemployment up. Even though we know too many of the rioters were unemployed - that's bad for them and bad for the rest of us too.\n\nThe job of government is to act to prevent crime, not just stand back and lament crime.\n\nThirty years ago the Tories said there was no such thing as society. Now they admit it exists but they think it has failed. And they don't think government has any responsibility in supporting a stronger, fairer society to put it right.\n\nDavid Cameron before the election said on crime it was big government that was to blame. So that's why he's\n\ncut back the police\n\ncut back their powers\n\ncut back youth services\n\ncut back community support\n\ncut back jobs\n\ncut back hope.\n\nDavid Cameron's claim that the riots are the product of a broken society to me sounds like a form of surrender.\n\nAn excuse for government to turn its back and dodge the blame if crime goes up.\n\nThe Tories claim to be the party of law and order. But look at the facts.\n\nEvery Tory government since records began has seen crime go up not down.\n\nTories in government don't cut crime.\n\nBecause in the end they just don't believe in the things you need to do.\n\nThey don't believe in active government, they don't believe in strengthening society.If we'd said before the 1997 election that under Labour crime would fall by 40 per cent no one would have believed it could be done.\n\nBut we did.\n\nTough on crime.\n\nTough on the causes of crime.\n\nStrong powers.\n\nStrong safeguards.\n\nStrong prevention.\n\nBacking the police.\n\nLabour the party of Law and Order and that is how we will stay."],[10,"'Road rage' motorcyclist kicks car causing dramatic pile-up – video","Police in California are asking for witnesses to come forward after a motorcyclist kicked a car while traveling at a high speed along a freeway in Santa Clarita.

built the bomb that killed 22 people at the Manchester Arena in under four days, it has emerged amid reports he met Isis-linked militants in Libya.\n\nPolice said the attacker purchased parts for the bomb after flying back from the country on 18 May, while experts confirmed terror training would have enabled Abedi to build it in 24 hours.\n\nThe 22-year-old had made numerous trips to Libya after his parents returned to live there during the country’s bloody civil war, possibly fighting against Muammar Gaddafi’s soldiers alongside his father.\n\n​Islamist groups swiftly gained power in the conflict, where Isis has seized the opportunity to gain a foothold amid warnings the country could become a primary launch pad for terror attacks in Europe.\n\nAmong the countless militias battling in Libya is Katibat al-Battar al-Libi, an Isis special operations unit whose operatives are said to have met Abedi during his visits to Tripoli and the coastal city of Sabratha.\n\nA retired European intelligence officer told the New York Times that Abedi kept in contact with the militants after returning to Manchester.\n\n“When Abedi was in the UK, the contacts happened sometimes by phone,” he said. “If the content of the call was sensitive, he used phones that were disposable, or dispatches were sent from Libya by his contacts to his ‘friend’ - living in Germany or Belgium - who then sent it to Abedi in the UK.”\n\nBritish intelligence agencies are working with their Libyan counterparts to piece together Abedi’s activities in the country, which is split between rival governments and thousands of militias.\n\n​Katibat al-Battar al-Libi was originally formed by Libyan jihadis fighting in Syria in 2012, and attracted Belgian, French and Tunisian foreign fighters.\n\nAmong them was the Paris attacks ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who was also linked to terror attacks at the Brussels Jewish Museum, the Thalys train attack and several failed plots.\n\nResearch by Cameron Colquhoun, the managing director of corporate intelligence consultancy Neon Century, found that many of the Battar brigade’s members moved back to Libya and set up terror training camps, focusing on mass murder, weapons training and bomb-making.\n\nAmong the terrorists to have gone through training by affiliated fighters in Sabratha is theIsis gunman who killed 30 British tourists on a beach in Tunisia in 2015.\n\nIsis training camps used by “plotters actively planning operations against Europe” on the coast have been targeted by US air strikes, which have killed commanders.\n\nThe first concrete link between Libya and terror attacks in Europe came in December, when a failed Tunisian asylum seeker rammed a lorry into a Christmas market in Berlin.\n\nInvestigators found that the attacker, Anis Amri, had been communicating with Isis fighters in the group’s Libyan stronghold of Sirte using an encrypted messaging app.\n\nEuropol has warned that as the so-called Islamic State loses swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, it will adopt new tactics to attack the West as defeated jihadis return home to Europe or move into other conflict zones.\n\n“Libya could develop into a second springboard for Isis, after Syria, for attacks in the EU and the North African region,” said a report.\n\n“Since mid-2015 Libya has become a major destination for Isis fighters in its own right and is believed to having become a hub for EU foreign terrorist fighters who, on returning to Europe, plan further terrorist attacks.”\n\nEuropol warned that jihadis in the country might have been driven out of Sirte but still possess stockpiles of weapons and “unlimited places in which jihadists could be trained for future terrorist attacks”. \n\nIf Abedi underwent terror training in Libya – or in Syria as some officials have suggested – he is likely to have been instructed on bomb-making.\n\nGreater Manchester Police have said he made “core purchases” for the device detonated at Manchester Arena alone, and in the four days between when he flew back from Libya and launched the attack.\n\nLike those built by Syria-trained Isis militant Najim Laachraoui for the Paris and Brussels attacks, the Manchester bomb used the homemade explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP).\n\nIt has become a hallmark of Isis attacks and plots, being found mid-manufacture by supporters in Germany and France, and can be made cheaply from commercially-available chemicals.\n\nDr Sidney Alford, an explosives engineer, said making a lethal quantity of the explosive could take just 24 hours.\n\n“It’s simple,” he told The Independent. “It takes only about a couple of hours to make, then you need to filter it and wash it and dry it. \n\n“How long it takes to dry depends on your facilities but in a normal house with a radiator or something to stand it on, you could leave it overnight.”\n\nDr Alford, the chairman of Alford Technologies, said TATP is volatile and activated extremely easily, describing it as “sensitive”.\n\n“I’m quite sure that a person who has been on a terrorist course will be instructed by people who will know how to arrange things so that the possibility of killing yourself [during manufacture] is quite low,” he added.\n\n“I’m guessing that Abedi was given experience in doing it.”\n\nHe is believed to have packed the explosive in powder form inside a bag, surrounded by screws and nuts intended to inflict maximum death and injury. \n\nDr Alford said evidence from the scene of the blast suggested Abedi had a device to activate the bomb himself, but that there may also have been a secondary detonator capable of receiving a radio signal from a phone anywhere in the world.\n\nThe possibility would chime with Isis propaganda statements issued shortly after the attack, which claimed that a device had been remotely detonated and did not describe the atrocity as a suicide bombing.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said Abedi made many movements alone in the four days between arriving back in the UK and launching the attack, moving around Manchester with a blue suitcase they are trying to trace.\n\nA “significant” car was discovered in the Rusholme area, where he made several visits in his final days, was discovered on Friday, with a 24-year-old man being arrested.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said he is one of 11 men, aged between 18 and 44, who remain in custody on suspicion of terror offences.\n\nOfficers have been stepping up security in the city ahead of a fundraising concert by Ariana Grande, who has visited fans injured in the attack in hospital.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call the anti-terror hotline anonymously on 0800 789321 or send images and footage to police by visiting the UK Police Image Appeal website."],[10,"'Give us more armed police or terror death toll could be ten times worse' say security experts","The London Bridge killings last night sparked calls for more armed police after it emerged the toll could have been “ten times worse.”\n\nArmed police stormed the scene and killed the three knifemen eight minutes after the first emergency call.\n\nSecurity experts are dubbing the operation a “major success” but warn the body count could have been worse, with Britain so short of firearms officers.\n\nLast year an extra 600 SAS-style specialist firearms officers were unveiled by the Metropolitan Police to defend against terrorists in London.\n\nBut the Tories have since 2010 slashed armed police numbers by 1,000 making us more vulnerable to attack.\n\nOne former intelligence officer - who worked in counter-terrorism - told the Daily Mirror: “This government has attacked Labour on security but the Tories have crippled our armed response capability.\n\n“In fact Labour were pretty good on budgets for MI5 and counter -terror operations and Theresa May and her defence secretary Michael Fallon are hypocrites.\n\n“They have slashed troop numbers and armed police numbers. It is the bravery and skill of the police officers involved that meant the London Bridge toll was not ten times worse.”\n\nWhile firearms units in Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham have strong armed forces an attack in a smaller town could cause massive casualties.\n\nFormer Prime Minister David Cameron ordered a review of the use of guns by police in England and Wales following the November 2015 Paris attacks, which left 130 people dead.\n\nAnd his Home Secretary Theresa May’s department slashed armed police numbers in England and Wales by 1,000.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies says government spending on the Police fell by 14 per cent in real terms between 2010-11 and 2014-15.\n\nBut counter -terror money did not fall.\n\nIFS data suggests that in 2010-11 the level of the Counter Terrorism Police Grant was £471million. That figure rose to £564million in 2014-15, and rose again in 2016-17 to £670 million.\n\nBut more counter terror money has not led to more armed police.\n\nIn March last year there were 5,639 firearms officers in England and Wales.\n\nWhen the Tories took office in 2010, that figure stood at 6,653.\n\nLatest figures reveal if you take into account people leaving there are still 374 fewer armed officers on the streets of England and Wales today than there were in 2010, despite the new 600 armed police.\n\nFormer commander of British forces in Afghanistan Colonel Richard Kemp - who has advised the British government on terrorism - said: “I have commanded armed soldiers in a policing role in Northern Ireland over many years and was responsible for terrorism intelligence at COBRA, dealing with a number of terrorist outrages.\n\n“Arming all police at all times throughout Britain is long overdue.\n\n“At London Bridge the first police on the scene were unarmed and although they courageously attacked the terrorists with their batons were unable to stop the killing.\n\n“Had they been armed lives would have been saved.\n\n“I have total admiration for the police who arrived and killed the three terrorists within eight minutes of the attack beginning.\n\n“But had this attack taken place virtually anywhere outside central London the response time would have been much higher and the death toll could have been in the dozens.\n\n“Arming the police will not happen overnight and will be costly but the reality of the growing terrorist threat means we must start doing it now.\n\n“Many ex soldiers, already firearms trained, will be eligible to become armed officers.\n\n“Many police officers will resist this move for understandable reasons. But we do not employ and pay police to do as they wish. We employ them to do what we require to safeguard British citizens.\n\n“Some people will point to the number of US firearms incidents and use them as a reason not to arm our police.\n\n“But a more realistic yardstick is Northern Ireland. All police officers have always been armed in Northern Ireland and remain so today and few objective observers would question their competence and professionalism.”\n\nAnd police on the ground in London Bridge on Sunday evening appeared to support calls for more armed officers.\n\nOne constable manning a security cordon near Borough underground station said:\n\n“Some of us are standing here equipped with handcuffs, a Taser and a truncheon and the terrorists have guns, knives, and may be wearing explosives.\n\n“We’re trying to do a good job but we do feel vulnerable. Maybe it is time for a rethink about us all being armed. Everyone’s nervous.”\n\nLast year the new Metropolitian Police ‘super cops’ were revealed.\n\nThe heavily-armed unit are part of a new wave of 600 highly trained marksmen deployed onto the streets of London each day, many on fast motorbikes.\n\nSimilar units are being rolled out in other major UK cities.\n\nBut ex-Met police officer Alex Stewart- who served for five years said: “I am firmly in favour of police remaining unarmed and that is the view of the vast majority of my former colleagues.\n\n“The police has a highly trained and capable firearms cohort within it that can give a very good response\n\nwhen an armed one is needed.\n\n\"Police need to work with communities to get trust and respect and that’s not possible if you look like an occupying army.”"],[10,"Body found during River Dee search confirmed as missing woman Moira Morrison","Police have confirmed that a body found in an Aberdeen river is that of Moira Morrison.\n\nMrs Morrison, 62, was reported missing from her home in the Mannofield area on Tuesday night after last being seen at around 3pm in the “river walk” area of Garthdee.\n\nOfficers discovered a body near Riverside Drive, close to the Bridge of Dee at around 10.30am yesterday morning.\n\nInspector Steve McEwan, who helped lead the search confirmed today that the body had been identified as Mrs Morrison.\n\nHe said: “We are providing support to her family and our thoughts are obviously with them at this very difficult time.\n\n“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Aberdeen Coastguard, RNLI, Scottish Fire & Rescue Service and the Police Scotland specialist units who assisted with extensive searches this week.\n\n“I would also like to thank those members of the public who went out of their way to provide information in response to our appeals.”"],[10,"London Bridge attackers slammed by Muslim Council of Britain as 'cowards' for launching attack during Ramadan","ONE of Britain’s most prominent Muslim groups have condemned the terror attack that took place at London Bridge last night.\n\nThree terrorists rammed people on London Bridge using a van before getting out and stabbing people with knives.\n\nDid you see the London Bridge terror attack, or know anyone involved?

There is no ignoring the fact that we, the police, simply do not have the resources to manage an event like this on our own.”\n\nAddressing the Home Secretary Amber Rudd at the Police Federation’s annual conference last week, Mr White had said an attack was a case of \"not if, but when\" following sharp cuts.\n\nThe Government says that crime figures have continued to fall despite the budget cuts. However, police groups have issued repeated warnings that reduce manpower was making it difficult to do jobs.\n\nAfter the Spring Budget 2016-17 Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd warned that central government cuts were having a serious impact on Manchester’s police service.\n\n“As my report makes clear, this is still very much a ‘cuts budget’. The Chancellor’s plan to protect policing budgets is full of holes, has not been borne out in real terms, and offers no foresight beyond this financial year,” he said at the time.\n\n“To make his sums add up, I have had to increase the amount people pay through their council tax, but even this can’t assuage the impact that cuts have had and continue to have on Greater Manchester’s police service.”\n\nAround 4,000 troops are on standby across the UK to help the policing effort during ‘Operation Temperer’, which is reinforcing police after the terror alert level was raised to critical.\n\nSpeaking earlier in the general election campaign Conservative Home Secretary Amber Rudd refused to rule out further police cuts.\n\n“I think the important statistic is that crime has fallen by 2010 by a third. We believe that we can control the Budget and reduce crime,” she told BBC Radio 4 at the time.\n\nAfter the attack, Ms Rudd said: “We have now gone to a critical level in terms of the threat. Operation Temperer has now been invoked and that means there will be additional military personnel coming to backfill the armed police officers so that they can support other areas.\n\n“Today we have 984 members of military coming forward as requested by the police. They will be initially deployed in London but also elsewhere in the country as requested and they will form an important part of the defence going forward.”\n\nLabour has pledged to put 10,000 more police officers on the beat and said the police force is “crying out for more manpower”."],[10,"MURDER: Man’s battered body found near burned out vehicle in Goodmayes car park","Detectives are appealing today for witnesses after the 54-year-old man was found dead near the vehicle that had been destroyed by fire in a car park in Castleton Road, off Goodmayes Road, near Green Lane.\n\nThe Fire Brigade was first at the scene at 5.50am on Monday, less than a mile from Goodmayes Primary School, when they discovered the body and police were called in.\n\nA post mortem examination yesterday gave cause of death as “blunt force trauma”.\n\nAn resident told the Recorder he woke up after hearing noises, and saw the victim lying almost naked next to the car.\n\n“I saw the car was burning,” he said.\n\n“I was surprised because it had been there for a couple of months.\n\n“There was a man lying near the car, he was dressed only in boxers.

Yet this time, standing in the same spot at the lectern in Downing Street less than a fortnight later, there was a significant, dramatic step change in tone.\n\nEven though the death toll is smaller than Manchester, her message was more serious and uncompromising. \"There is, to be frank, far too much tolerance of extremism in our country,\" she said. \"It is time to say enough is enough.\"\n\nlead in the opinion polls has slipped Her tough message was delivered against the backdrop of a general election, which will go ahead this Thursday, despite the campaign now being marred by two terror attacks -- unprecedented in modern British politics. Some of her political opponents will claim that she has ramped up the authoritarian rhetoric to win back votes after her lead in the opinion polls has slipped against Labour and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nEven before Manchester, May had portrayed Corbyn as weak on security and counter-terrorism, but that pitch was amplified by the Prime Minister in the days after the concert bombing. With just four days left until polling day, it is difficult to see how she can accuse the Labour leader of being soft on terrorism without crossing the line into bad taste -- but expect one of her senior Conservative ministers to do so instead.\n\ntrue authoritarian colors Yet regardless of the election, May's statement on Sunday revealed her true authoritarian colors -- an instinct she has played down as she has tried to appeal to all wings of her Conservative Party as Prime Minister. Before becoming PM last year, May was Home Secretary for six years, during which time she developed a reputation as an authoritarian who is tough on law and order.\n\nIn 2011, she oversaw the replacement of control orders -- effectively placing terror suspects under house arrest -- with a more flexible measure involving shorter curfews, but this was after an internal battle with the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, who took a more liberal approach to law and order.\n\nOn internet regulation, May was much more uncompromising, introducing greater powers for security services to carry out surveillance of peoples' online data -- known by critics as the \"Snoopers' Charter\" who were concerned about the privacy of innocent users.\n\nThe internet has once again become the focus of May's attention as Prime Minister: first, after Manchester, she secured the backing of G7 leaders for her demands for internet giants like Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to do more to stamp out extremism.\n\nToday, she has doubled down on that demand, saying: \"We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed. Yet that is precisely what the internet -- and the big companies that provide internet-based services -- provide.\"\n\nFacebook has responded by insisting it is getting tough on those \"safe spaces\" and promising it will become a \"hostile environment for terrorists.\"\n\nThere will now be a renewed appetite in Britain for tougher internet regulation when Parliament is reopened after the election -- but ISIS propaganda will always find a way to break through and find the troubled would-be perpetrators who know where to look for it.\n\nBut there are also similar \"safe spaces\" in the real world, that May says have been allowed to flourish because too many people are too tolerant of extremism.\n\nThere are people in the Muslim community who will say they are already doing enough: Britain's intelligence agencies receive tip-offs all the time. In fact, as the Prime Minister herself said, five credible plots have been thwarted since the Westminster Bridge attack in March. MI5 was warned five times about the Manchester suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, but he was not stopped.\n\nThe Prime Minister will have found it easy to revert to her authoritarian nature by declaring \"enough is enough\", but it is going to be difficult to translate those words into practise."],[10,"Armed police fire stun gun at knife-wielding man near parliament","LONDON (Reuters) - British police said officers guarding one of the gates to the Westminster parliament in central London had fired a stun gun at a man who reached for a knife when they approached him on Friday but it was not initially being considered a terrorist incident.\n\nLondon police (MPS) said the man was acting suspiciously at around 11 a.m. near one of the gates where a militant killed a policeman less than three months ago.\n\nAfter firing a Taser stun gun, police detained the man. Armed police had guns trained on the suspect as he was restrained and bundled into a police van, witnesses at the scene told Reuters.\n\n“The man reached for a knife,” police said in a statement. “At this time it is too early to understand the motivation so we have not declared this a terrorist incident.

He was shot dead at the scene.\n\nThat attack was followed by a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester which killed 22 and a similar deadly attack on London Bridge earlier this month, thrusting security and policing to the fore of campaigning before last Thursday’s election.\n\nThe spate of recent attacks were the deadliest in Britain since four British Islamist suicide bombers killed 52 people on the London transport system in July 2005.\n\nAnother witness to Friday’s incident, who asked not to be identified, said police had been shouting at crowds to get back as the man was detained in one of the busiest locations in central London which is typically crammed with tourists.\n\n“The guy was on the ground on his front on the pavement alongside Parliament Square,” the witness said. “They had him on the ground and were warning they would taze (stun) him again.”\n\nThe gates to parliament were briefly closed following the incident but the area returned to normal shortly afterwards."],[10,"Investigation making 'immense' progress as police 'get hold of 'large part of terror network'","A relative of the 22-year-old said he had felt increasing frustration at his treatment in the UK, heightened after a friend was fatally knifed in what he perceived to be a religious hate crime.\n\nShe added that the British-born bomber began referring to others in the country as \"infidels\" who were \"unjust to Arabs\".\n\nLibyan authorities, who are questioning Abedi's parents and siblings,claimed he made a final phone call to his mother on the eve of the attack, in which he said: \"Forgive me.\"\n\nMusic fans were targeted at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena in the worst terrorist attack on British soil since the July 7 bombing in London in 2005.\n\nAs Abedi's route to mass murder continued to be probed:\n\nDowning Street announced the Government's emergency Cobra committee will meet in Whitehall on Friday morning to discuss the latest developments, chaired by the Home Secretary.

Very wicked. To target that sort of thing.'\n\nShe also thanked hospital staff and paramedics who worked tirelessly to keep the children alive in the hours after the tragedy, and told them of her shock, saying: 'The awful thing was that everyone was so young.'\n\nFourteen children remain at the hospital, including five in critical care. A total of 75 people were admitted to eight hospitals following the attack at Manchester Arena.\n\nAn eight-year-old girl was among those killed when Salman Abedi, 22, detonated an improvised explosive device minutes after pop star Ariana Grande finished performing at the venue on Monday night. \n\nOver more than 60 years, the Queen has stepped in to provide comfort for the victims of conflict, disasters and terror attacks. From servicemen injured in the Second World War to the victims of the 7/7 bombing, the Queen has often visited hospitals in the aftermath of tragedy to show solidarity with her subjects in their hour of need.\n\nToday was no exception as the monarch reassured the young victims and their families, and shared in their horror as they recounted their stories of how they escaped the blast alive.\n\nMillie Robson, from Co Durham, who was wearing an Ariana Grande concert t-shirt in her hospital bed, told the Queen how she had met the pop star backstage before the event after winning VIP passes in a competition.  \n\nShe was on her way to meet her father, David, at the arena exit when the bomb was detonated. Addressing David, the Queen said: 'It's not something you expect at all' and described the atrocity as 'very alarming'.   \n\nMillie praised the hospital staff to the monarch, saying they have been 'fantastic'.

Very wicked to target that sort of thing,' referring to the concert. \n\nThe Queen also visited Amy Barlow, 12, from Helmshore, Lancashire, on the ward.

The age of them, cruel,' she told one member of staff.\n\nShe learnt about the role each had played on the night - including how many had come in from home to offer their help - and commended them for 'coming together'. \n\nThe royal visitor, who was wearing a blue coat and orange hat, was met by the Lord-Lieutenant of Greater Manchester Warren Smith as she arrived. \n\nHer visit came shortly after staff gathered outside the hospital for a minute's silence, when they remembered those who had lost their lives, before bursting into spontaneous applause. \n\nThe silence, which fell at 11am, also marked the nation's solidarity with the 119 who were injured in the blast at the Manchester Arena following a concert, as well as others affected by the atrocity.\n\nCrowds also gathered at well-known sites in the UK, including London's Parliament and Trafalgar Square. In Manchester thousands of residents gathered at St Ann's Square to honour the victims of the terror attack.  \n\nT-SHIRT SELLER RUSHED TO HELP 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL HURT IN BLAST...  Pictured, Amy Barlow recovering in hospital  A merchandise seller ripped up concert T-shirts to help stem the bleeding of a 12-year-old girl injured in the Manchester bomb attack before she was taken to hospital, her family said. The parents of Amy Barlow, from Helmshore in Lancashire, told how the man used souvenirs from the Ariana Grande concert as bandages while taking instructions from a doctor over the phone. Amy's mother Kathy, 43, was with her daughter when the bomb went off and said it felt like 'someone had thrown a massive firework' as they were struck by shrapnel. The family shared their story from Amy's bedside at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital after she was visited by the Queen. Amy said: 'I just came out of the arena, and I was with my friend and my mum, and then I felt something hitting my legs - and then I ran. 'I saw the blood pour down my legs and had to sit down.' Mrs Barlow, a graphic designer, said: When she got outside, we realised how bad it was.' Amy suffered multiple injuries on her legs and was struck by a bolt on her side, but outside people quickly rushed to her aid. Her father Grant Barlow, 46, said: 'The guy selling T-shirts used the T-shirts as bandages.' Mrs Barlow said: 'I think he was selling them outside, but he very quickly dumped his bag on the floor, ripped them all up. 'He was on the phone to the doctor, and he said \"get her leggings off, hold her feet up\". 'And other people dashed to help me because I couldn't do it on my own - and then he tied them up.' She added that a trainee nurse, someone with first aid experience and a man trained to deal with trauma kept Amy talking and also looked after her friend until her parents came. Describing the moment of the attack, Amy said: 'I thought something had crashed into the building.' Amy suffered multiple injuries on her legs and was struck by a bolt on her side, but outside people quickly rushed to her aid. Pictured, Amy's parents Grant and Kathy  Mrs Barlow added: 'It sort of sounded like someone had thrown a massive firework at our feet and it felt like stones had been thrown. Like someone had chucked the stone really hard. 'But I think in the panic, we just ran... I just said \"Run\", and we ran as far as we could, until we realised she was injured.\" Mrs Barlow escaped with just a cut on her leg and Amy's friend had shrapnel in her hip but is recovering at home. The youngster is a big Grande fan - but her T-shirt in honour of the star was ripped off by medics as they worked to treat Amy, her parents said. Mr Barlow vowed to write to the singer and ask for a new one as Amy recovers in hospital. "],[10,"Trump addresses London terror attack, says 'bloodshed must end'","President Trump said Sunday night the \"bloodshed must end,\" addressing the terror attack in London in remarks at a gala at Ford's Theatre in Washington.\n\nIn his first public spoken remarks on the attack, he described it as a \"horrific terrorist attack\" and said he spoke with UK Prime Minister Theresa May to express the United States' support, saying the U.S. will do everything in its power to \"being those that are guilty to justice.\"\n\n\"We renew our resolve, stronger than ever before, to protect the United States and its allies from a vile enemy that has waged war on innocent life.

Police fired on the demonstrators.\n\nKABUL — A protest Friday that began at the site of a huge bombing in Kabul earlier this week and made its way to the gates of the Afghan presidential palace turned deadly, with security forces opening fire to disperse angry crowds trying to get inside.\n\nMore than 1,000 people demonstrated as Afghans mourned the victims of a massive truck bomb that killed nearly 100 people and wounded more than 450 on Wednesday.\n\nThere were conflicting reports on the number of people killed in Friday’s protest.\n\nOfficials at Emergency Hospital, one of Kabul’s main trauma centers, said at least four dead and 15 wounded people were taken there. Abdul Hafiz Mansur, a member of Parliament from Kabul, said eight protesters were shot to death by police, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Kabul police chief, General Hassan Shah Frogh, said some of the protesters were carrying rocks and weapons and had fired at the police, wounding four officers, before the police returned fire.\n\nAbout a hundred of the demonstrators rushed toward the police as the protesters attempted to move closer to the presidential palace. Police also sprayed them with water cannons and tear gas.\n\nVideo from the protest then showed officers firing in the crowd’s direction, but it was unclear whether those bullets were hitting anyone.\n\nFrogh added that Salem Izidyar, son of the deputy speaker of the Senate, was among the protesters who had been killed.\n\nThe situation seemed to be getting more violent later in the day as the Afghan forces began shooting for long stretches.\n\nHaroon Mutaref, one of the protest organizers, said the demonstrations would continue despite the clashes. “We are still here, although the police shot at people,” he said. “We are here, and we will not leave until we reach our goal of getting justice.”\n\nWith emotions running high after the clashes, there were fears that political strongmen might try to take advantage of the anger produced by the bombing deaths to move against the government.\n\n“No one can stop people from protesting, and they used force. They rammed military vehicles into crowds setting up protest tents,” said Gul Haider, a former warlord from the northern part of the country and military commander who joined the protests after he heard news of the clashes. “If we wanted to push our way in, we would have reached the palace.”\n\nHe said he had seen dozens of wounded at the hospital, and six dead bodies from the protest.\n\nSeveral hours after the protests began, President Ashraf Ghani put out a lengthy statement asking for calm.\n\n“Civil and peaceful protests are the rights of all citizens of the country,” Ghani’s statement said. “But among them, those who want to agitate and hurt public order, their issue is separate — they will not be allowed to use the people’s emotions against the people’s interest.”\n\nGhani’s coalition partner — the government’s chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah — put out a video message saying the administration was ready to sit down for talks with the protesters.\n\nAmnesty International has called for an investigation into the use of force by security agencies against protesters, saying it “illustrates the authorities’ contempt for the lives” of the Afghan public.\n\n“While there are reports that a minority of protesters used violence including throwing stones at the police, this does not justify such an excessive and deadly response,” said Biraj Patnaik, Amnesty International’s South Asia director.\n\nThe protests began peacefully Friday morning, as hundreds of people chanted for the government to resign as they gathered near the bombing site. The protest continued as demonstrators began moving toward the presidential palace."],[10,"Man cradling pint becomes unlikely symbol of defiance after London Bridge","A photo of a man holding onto his pint as he fled the terrorist attack at London Bridge on Saturday night has become an unlikely symbol of British defiance.\n\nThe unidentified man talks to someone to his left with the pint in his right hand. As others run he appears relatively calm.\n\nSome Twitter users have used the hashtag #WeAreNotAfraid and shared the picture to show defiance in the face of terror.\n\nHowever the photograph has divided opinion, with some arguing that such attacks are not an arena for humour – and that sharing the picture is a way of “normalising” terrorist attacks.\n\nSeven people were killed after people were mown down by a van and stabbed in an attack by three suspected terrorists in the London Bridge area.\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has praised the bravery of members of the public and the police as she announced the death toll had risen.

Should you be honest, or is it best to turn the TV off and shield them from the news?\n\nHere’s some advice from British Red Cross expert Dr Sarah Davidson.\n\nThe key, when explaining an event such as a terrorist attack to children, is not going into detail.\n\nYou should not lie but you also want to keep it low key. Offer a simple, direct explanation that is age appropriate.\n\nIt’s fine to say, for example, that there was an explosion in town. Avoid euphemism and graphic detail. Keep it as simple as possible.\n\nIt is really important to keep normal routines going, such as school and bed time.\n\nSome common signs that may signal a child’s distress include bed wetting and becoming clingy or afraid to go outdoors.\n\nTheir sleep might be disturbed and their diet might change. You should watch out for children acting younger than their age.\n\nHowever, these signs do not mean that a child isn’t coping – simply that they may need more support from their parents and carers.\n\nLike adults, children are fundamentally resilient. Reassure them that their home and school are safe places, and that these events, while tragic, rarely happen.\n\nSarah’s team of volunteers have been providing emotional and psychological support to families affected by the Manchester bombing.\n\nThey have a lot of experience supporting people who have witnessed or been affected by traumatic events. These include terrorist attacks and natural disasters.\n\nSix volunteers were also on-hand to provide support to people following the recent London Bridge attack.\n\nWe have launched an appeal in partnership with Manchester City Council to raise funds for people affected by the attack.\n\nThe Manchester Emergency Fund will support people who have been injured or bereaved. Donations will help alleviate immediate suffering and ensure that victims and their families do not face short-term financial difficulties.\n\nWe have also launched the UK Solidarity Fund following the London terror attack on Saturday 3 June. The Fund will support people who have been injured, bereaved or traumatised by terror attacks in the UK, helping to alleviate immediate suffering and ensure that victims and their families do not face short-term financial difficulties.\n\nThis post was updated on 18 August 2017. "],[10,"Peckham Rye stabbing: Man killed in sixth fatal stabbing in six days","A man has been fatally stabbed in Peckham, making him the sixth person to die in a knife attack in London since Saturday.\n\nPolice and paramedics were called to Rye Lane at 3.15pm on Friday to reports of a fight. They found a man in his 20s with stab wounds. \n\nHe was pronounced dead half an hour later at 3.51pm. Police said the young man’s next of kin have been informed.\n\nDetectives are also investigating the death of a man who was stabbed on a bus in central London in the early hours of Friday morning.\n\nThe 48-year-old victim was found fatally wounded on the 189 bus in Gloucester Place, near Dorset Square.\n\nDetectives believe the man boarded the vehicle at Brent Cross bus station at 11.13pm, but are investigating when and where the stabbing took place.\n\nThe man was treated by paramedics but pronounced dead at the scene.

The city’s mayor said there was no indication it was an act of terrorism.\n\n(For a graphic on the map of the driver's course, click tmsnrt.rs/2rvktPe )\n\nWitnesses said the motorist mounted the sidewalk in a burgundy Honda sedan and sped along for more than three city blocks, knocking people over before the car struck a pole and came to rest at 45th Street and Broadway in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nPolice who arrested the driver identified him as Richard Rojas, 26, from the New York City borough of the Bronx.\n\nRojas was charged with one count of murder in the second-degree, aggravated vehicular homicide and multiple counts of attempted murder, a New York police spokesman said in an email late on Thursday. It was unclear if Rojas has an attorney.\n\nHe was expected to appear in court on Friday at an arraignment hearing.\n\nRojas had previously been arrested twice for drunken driving, in 2008 and 2015, and once this month on a charge of menacing for threatening another man with a knife, police said.\n\nA source for the New York Police Department, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters Rojas was believed to have been under the influence of some intoxicating substance at the time of Thursday’s incident, but preliminary test results for alcohol came back negative.\n\nABC News cited unidentified police sources as saying Rojas had apparently been high on synthetic marijuana.\n\nRojas was taken to Bellevue Hospital rather than to the city’s central booking facility after being detained at a police precinct on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, according to the police source who spoke to Reuters.\n\nThere was no indication the incident was an act of terrorism, Mayor Bill de Blasio told a news conference at the scene.\n\nInitial reports brought to mind vehicle attacks on pedestrians in recent months in Britain, France, Germany, Israel and Sweden.\n\nSecurity camera footage showed the car slam into pedestrians who moments earlier were ambling along, some carrying shopping bags and others pushing baby strollers.\n\nThe incident took place close to noon ET (1600 GMT) on a bright, sunny day.\n\n“People were being hit and rolling off the car,” said Josh Duboff, who works at the nearby Thomson Reuters headquarters. He leaped out of the way to avoid being struck.\n\nShoes were scattered on the sidewalk. A woman’s body lay covered with a bloodstained blanket. A police officer kept vigil nearby, sadly shaking his head.\n\nThe dead woman was named by police as Alyssa Elsman, 18, who was on vacation with her family from Michigan.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people, many of them tourists from around the world, pass daily through Times Square, the heart of the Broadway theater district.\n\nThe bustling streets are heavily patrolled by police, some on horseback. Many, but not all, sidewalks are lined with barricades and planters for fear of vehicle attacks.\n\nA bouncer from a Planet Hollywood restaurant and a ticket agent were among onlookers who helped police subdue the suspect when he tried to flee the scene, media reports said.\n\nBroadway shows were scheduled to go ahead as planned on Thursday evening in the many theaters in the area, organizers said.\n\nNavy records show Rojas enlisted in September 2011 and was based in Illinois and Florida, working as an electrician’s mate fireman apprentice.\n\nHe was arrested a year later at a naval base in Jacksonville, Florida, where officials said he attacked a cab driver, shouted “my life is over,” and threatened to kill police, according to court records. Rojas was charged with misdemeanor battery and resisting an officer without violence, but it was unclear how the case was resolved.\n\nNavy records show he spent two months in a military prison in Charleston, South Carolina, in the summer of 2013, but did not say why. He left the Navy in May 2014.\n\nAuthorities cordoned off an area from 41st to 47th streets and from Sixth to Eighth avenues for several hours after the incident, effectively shutting down one of the busiest parts of one of the busiest cities in the world.\n\nThe crash occurred outside the headquarters of the Reuters news agency, 3 Times Square. Building foreman Rodney Muir said he heard what sounded like a big bang and crunching metal. He said he looked out and saw what appeared to be a body in the street.\n\nOne of the injured, Cheryl Howard, had blood dripping down her right arm and a bruise above her left eye. She and her daughter were shopping when the car sped toward them.\n\n“I‘m so freaked out!” Howard’s daughter said. “They mowed everyone down.”\n\nTimes Square was evacuated in May 2010 when a car bomb that failed to explode was found in an SUV. Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized American and Taliban-trained militant, later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nSix months ago the city completed a $55 million, nearly six-year renovation of Times Square that turned roadways into pedestrian zones.

However, the period this covers is unclear."],[10,"A court has ruled that police can execute your dog if it moves or barks","If you want to ruin the rest of your day, few things will accomplish that more quickly than stories of police officers shooting people’s pets.\n\nHere’s just one such story from 2014:\n\nA police officer in Filer, Idaho, explained the incident to a colleague minutes after it happened: “I get out to talk to the people, two dogs come around me, one of them’s growling and snarling. I kick it. It comes back around, now it’s growling and snarling. I kick it again. Then it lunges at me, I’m like, f— you. So, I just shot it.” He doesn’t sound broken up. Yes, Officer Tarek Hassani exited his car on a quiet suburban street, kicked a black labrador twice, shot the dog, and left it to die in a snowy driveway. And then? He issued its angry, upset owner a $100 ticket for having it off-leash.\n\nAnd there have been similar incidents since then — far too many, in fact. Though there’s no national database of how many dogs and other pets are killed by cops each year, the Puppycide Database, which tracks pet deaths at the hands of police using media reports and tips submitted by readers, has counted nearly 3,000 documented deaths.\n\nShockingly, a documentary from 2013 calculated that, on average, a pet dog is killed by a police officer once every 98 minutes.\n\nIt’s that context which makes so awful this week’s ruling from a circuit court in Michigan, which said that cops can kill any dog that doesn’t sit perfectly silent and still when the officer enters its home:\n\nA ruling from the 6th Circuit Court serves as a warning to dog owners: Teach your dog to sit still and be quiet or risk police justifiably shooting the dog. Mark and Cheryl Brown petitioned the court to hold the city and police officers from Battle Creek, Mich., accountable for shooting and killing their dogs while executing a search warrant of their home looking for evidence of drugs. The plaintiffs said the police officers’ actions amounted to the unlawful seizure of property in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The circuit court on Monday agreed with a lower court ruling siding with the police officers.\n\nHere’s one particularly gutting excerpt from the ruling, which describes how little a dog need do to be “justifiably” shot by police:\n\nOfficer Klein testified that after he shot and killed the first dog, he noticed the second dog standing about halfway across the basement. The second dog was not moving towards the officers when they discovered her in the basement, but rather she was “just standing there,” barking and was turned sideways to the officers. Klein then fired the first two rounds at the second dog.\n\nAfter hiding in a corner, this second dog made the mistake of moving and was shot again by another officer. She then tried to hide behind the furnace, at which point a third officer observed “blood coming out of numerous holes in the dog” and killed her with a final shot.\n\nThis behavior — barking, moving, hiding — is the “imminent threat to the officer’s safety” the judge said excused the officers’ decision to execute this dog?!\n\nThe first dog allegedly “lunged” at the cops, but by the admission of the officer who began shooting, it “had only moved a few inches” when he decided the dog should die. Is that seriously an “imminent threat”?\n\nThis ruling is deeply troubling to me as a dog owner and as a supporter of the Fourth Amendment.

'It is clear that he wanted to cause more damage than he did. \n\n'He grabbed his suitcase while shouting and causing a partial explosion. Fortunately nobody was hurt.\n\n'The suitcase immediately caught fire. The man then left his luggage burning and went down to the platform in pursuit of a station master.\n\n'Meanwhile the bag exploded a second time more violently. This bag contained nails and gas bottles.\n\n'The man then returned to the hall where he rushed to a soldier shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is Greatest). \n\n'The soldier immediately opened fire and hit the individual several times. The latter die on the spot as a result of his injuries,' he said.\n\nThe suspect was not wearing a suicide belt, as some Belgian media had reported, Van Der Sypt said. \n\nThe attacker's body was left lying in the station for several hours as medics could not approach him for fear that the explosives strapped to him could go off any second, official authorities said.\n\nInitial reports suggested the suspect - described as being 'tanned, well-built and in his 30s' - was wearing an explosive vest or rucksack, while witnesses later claimed he tried to blow up a trolley or a suitcase.  \n\nHe was shot by soldiers already patrolling the station and there were no other casualties.\n\nTerrified passengers inside the station ran towards the tracks as they tried to avoid the blast, while crying tourists outside fled in panic. Within a few minutes the busy nearby shops and restaurants were shut down.\n\nA bomb squad performed a controlled explosion of a bomb belt the suspect had on at the Central Station and evacuated the city's famed Grand Place square 650 feet away while checking to see if there were more hazards\n\nThe latest attack comes a year after three suicide bombers hit the capital of Brussels, killing 32 people and injuring hundreds more.  \n\nVan der Sypt said authorities are treating the incident 'as a terrorist attack' that was foiled when the suspect was 'neutralised'.\n\nMedics were unable to attend the attacker for several hours out of fear he could be carrying explosives and authorities only could confirm his death once a bomb squad had finished its work.\n\nNicolas Van Herrewegen, a railway employee, said the bomber was very agitated and 'screaming' about jihadists before blowing up on a 'small suitcase' next to him.\n\n'He [The suspect] screamed 'Allahu Akbar' (God is great), and detonated a small suitcase he was holding next to him. I was behind a wall when it exploded,' he said.\n\n'I went down and alerted my colleagues to evacuate everyone. He was still around but after that we didn't see him. It wasn't exactly a big explosion but the impact was pretty big. People were running away.'\n\nMr Herrewegen - who had heard shouting at the station's mezzanine level - described the suspect as being between 30 and 35, well-built and tanned with short hair, and wearing a white shirt and jeans.\n\nHe added: 'I saw that he had something on him because I could see wires emerging, so it may have been a suicide vest.'  \n\nBelgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon confirmed that the authorities know the identity of the terrorist suspect behind yesterday's attack on Brussels Central station.\n\nHe said he could not give a name or other information yet so as not to endanger current investigations, but according to Belgian local media the suspect is a 37-year-old Moroccan man from the Brussels municipality of Molenbeek, branded as the 'jihadist capital of Europe' which harboured Salah Adbeslam, in prison for the Paris attacks in 2015.\n\nBelgian media reported that the suspect in the latest Brussels attack was not yet known to Belgian intelligence services for terrorism and was not on any radicalisation watch list.\n\nBusiness daily De Tijd however said the man was well-known to juridical authorities and police for several sexual offenses.\n\nAmong those caught up in the carnage was Rozina Spinnoy from Scotland, who was at the station when she heard gunshots at around 9pm and was forced to flee.\n\nThe mother, who is married to a Belgian and is now living in the city, told the Daily Record:  'The next thing I saw two policemen coming towards me and telling me in French to 'get out, get out and go up the stairs.'\n\n'There were army trucks coming and sirens blaring and this was obviously just after the bomb had gone off and shots were fired so then it was chaos.'\n\nThe scene outside the station was one of panic, Mrs Spinnoy said, with taxi drivers piling as many crying locals into their cabs as possible. \n\nThe Scottish 45-year-old became desperate and said: 'I just kept thinking I wanted to get out of here and home to my three kids.'\n\nShe said the army patrolling the city was nothing out of the ordinary after last year's attack.   \n\nIn an confusing case of clashing details, witnesses claimed the attacker blew up a suitcase or a trolley - while prosecutors told French paper Libre Belgique that he was carrying a backpack and an explosive belt.\n\nSocial media images showed an intense ball of fire in an almost empty underground arrival hall. Soldiers, firefighters and police surrounded the station after it was evacuated.\n\nA train driver said he saw people running across the rail lines inside the station, broadcaster RTL reported.\n\nBelgian Police have said an incident with a person in Brussels Central station is under control.  'The centre of Brussels is calm,' mayor Philippe Close said in a tweet.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Charles Michel hailed the 'courage' of security forces and said he would chair National Security Council at the Law Street at 9am on Wednesday morning.\n\nHe thanked the military and staff of the NMBS who were present during the terrorist act. \n\n'They responded very professionally and courageously to this situation,' he said. \n\nA spokesman for Belgium's railway operator said: 'A crowd panicked in the station and ran for the tracks after an incident.' \n\n'There were people crying, there were people shouting,' said Elisa Roux, a spokeswoman for the Belgian rail company SNCB. \n\nThe 1930s Central station is largely underground and located in the heart of Brussels, a few blocks from the Grand Place and the Manneken Pis statue. \n\nStationmaster Jean-Michel Michel was quoted by DH newspaper saying: 'We heard the explosion. My colleague thought it was a bomb. The explosion was on the mezzanine level. \n\n'The man went down to platforms 3 and 4. He said 'Allahu Akbar'. I would put him at about 35 years old.'  \n\nThe center that monitors security threats in Belgium says the available information so far doesn't yet merit going to the highest possible terror alert level.\n\nOne witness claimed he was 'lucky to be alive' after something that sounded like a 'bomb' reportedly went off just metres away from him. \n\nLudoivic Hampton said: 'When you're walking through Central station and something that looked and sounded like a bomb goes off 30 metres away from you. I'm lucky to be alive.' \n\nTrains were diverted from the station and buses sent out to take passengers to the area, according to a railway spokeswoman.\n\nBroadcaster RTL quoted Fires Services spokesman Pierre Meys confirming that some kind of an explosion had happened in the city's Central station on Tuesday. Meys could not say what had caused the blast.\n\nHe could only confirm that firefighters were at the scene.\n\nA police spokesman said: 'There was an accident at Central Station.

Khuram Butt publicly abused moderate Muslims who spoke out against the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013. Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of anti-extremism group the Ramadhan Foundation, said Butt called him a 'Murtad' - traitor in Arabic - when he confronted Anjem Choudary about supporting terrorism days after the attack in Woolwich.\n\n2. In 2015 he talked of abandoning his pregnant wife Zahrah to wage holy war in Syria but relatives talked him out of it.\n\n3. In the same year a friend called the anti-terror hotline over his extremist behaviour and his obsession with YouTube rants by hate preachers.\n\nHe said: 'He was not arrested and was allowed to keep his passport. I did my bit, I know a lot of other people did their bit, but the authorities did not do their bit.'\n\n4. A mother was alarmed at him bribing schoolchildren with sweets and money in the local park to listen to him speak. Others said he was going door-to-door trying to approach youngsters. She also made a call to the anti-terror hotline was made.\n\n5. In 2016 he appeared on the Channel 4 film The Jihadis Next Door and was filmed unfurling an ISIS-type flag in Regent's Park before rowing with police called by frightened members of the public.\n\n6. Four months later - in May 2016 - he secured a job on the Tube and had access to tunnels under Parliament with no problems.\n\n7.He worked at Ummah Fitness in Ilford with Sajeel Shahid, 41, a member of the banned al-Muhajiroun network who was accused of helping train the 7/7 bomb ringleader Mohammed Siddique Khan. \n\n8. His mother Fahmida Saif, 60, said she had repeatedly warned her son off 'getting involved with religious fanatics' as details emerged of his key role in hate preacher Anjem Choudary's London terror group. \n\n9.Last year was reported to police last year for violent extremism and in July 2016 he physically and verbally abused crowds at an Eid festival. \n\nDr Usama Hasan, of the anti-extremist think-tank Quilliam, revealed he reported Butt to police and MI5. \n\nHe was screaming at 'everyone' including children enjoying fairground rides at a Muslim funfair in east London on July 6 last year.\n\nHe said: 'He was an al-Muhajiroun type guy, the network of Anjem Choudary and when I reported it to police I said I was pretty sure he was from that network. I said in my opinion he was a threat to national security because he was violent. He had no respect for anyone'.  \n\n10.Butt was arrested in January but was let off with a caution. \n\nThe Italian jihadi: Youssef Zaghba\n\n11.

After the incident his mother Valeria Collina said her son was 'closely followed' in Italy and she herself had asked police to take him into custody.\n\n13.

What we don't know yet is his exact journey from Manchester-born boy to suicide bomber.\n\nThe BBC has been told by a Muslim community worker that members of the public called the police anti-terrorism hotline about Abedi's extreme and violent views several years ago.\n\nWe don't know how the police responded to these reported hotline calls - but we have also learnt that earlier this year, Abedi's behaviour again raised concerns.\n\nAccording to our sources, he told local people about the value of dying for a cause.\n\nHe also made hardline statements about suicide bombings and the conflict in Libya.\n\nAbedi's parents fled Libya as opponents of Colonel Gaddafi's regime.\n\nLibya, alongside its North African neighbours, has been a centre for the rise of modern Islamist political movements.\n\nThese movements were originally dedicated to overthrowing dictatorial regimes and, to varying extents, promoting the idea of Islamic government.\n\nThe Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) wanted to overthrow Gaddafi and became the dominant revolutionary force in the country in the 1990s, until the dictator began turning the screw.\n\nMany of those with Islamist connections tried to flee - and many of them were granted refuge in the UK.\n\nSalman Abedi's father, Ramadan, was part of the broad network of opponents who supported those Islamist anti-Gaddafi aims. He arrived in the UK in the early 1990s.\n\nWe have been told by senior LIFG sources that he was not a member of the organisation. But he was known to be a dissident with some of the same political goals.\n\nThat brings us to south Manchester. It has long been a centre of Libyan politics in the UK, if not Europe.\n\nIt's where the British government gave refuge to many of those Gaddafi opponents - Birmingham and London being the other locations.\n\nSome of the Libyans in the UK, and in particular from Manchester, were later suspected by the security services of being aligned to al-Qaeda.\n\nI have spoken to some of these men down the years. They say their jihad was against Gaddafi alone. They wanted him overthrown.\n\nAnd overthrow him they eventually did - with the help of the British and Americans.\n\nAs the Arab Spring grew and Gaddafi began to wobble, these dissidents - and a fair few of their British-raised sons - returned to their revolutionary roots.\n\nMany joined the February 17th Martyr's Brigade, one of the key fighting units in that war. We have been told that Salman Abedi's father was part of the group who left the UK for one last battle against Gaddafi.\n\nThe BBC has been trying to put these questions to Ramadan Abedi. Shortly before that was to happen, Mr Abedi was arrested by security forces in Libya.\n\nThere were others from Manchester who went to fight - and most of them lived very close to each other.\n\nJust a mile away from the Abedi home lived Abdal Raouf Abdallah - now jailed for five-and-a-half years for terrorism offences.\n\nAbdallah was among the young British-Libyans who fought to overthrow the dictator - and he nearly paid for it with his life. He was shot in the back and was paralysed from the waist down.\n\nHe returned home proud. But at his later trial, prosecutors said his revolutionary fervour led him to facilitate the travel of other men from Manchester to join terror groups in Syria.\n\nHe protested at his trial that he hated the so-called Islamic State group - as did one of the men he was helping, Muslim convert Stephen Mustafa Gray.\n\nNot all of the men from this area were of Libyan heritage. One of the biggest IS recruiters locally was a man called Raphael Hostey - he lived halfway between the Abedis and Abdallah. My colleague Steve Swann has previously reported on how this young man played a key role in getting others from Manchester into Syria.\n\nIn all, south Manchester has been one of the hotspots of Syria-linked militancy in the UK: Six have gone to fight and die, at least four more are believed to be fighting and another half a dozen jailed.\n\nThose cases and others that cannot be reported for legal reasons give some indication of a triangle of Islamist-jihadist connections between Manchester, Libya and Syria and you can read more them in our unique database of recent British jihadists.\n\nIt is a complicated picture and there are still lots of unanswered questions about what precisely happened to Abedi.\n\nA family friend in Tripoli has told BBC News that Ramadan Abedi took his son out of the city fearing the \"influence of gangsters and criminals.\" Mr Abedi reportedly said he feared his son was becoming increasingly drawn into drugs and criminality after the death of one of his friends in nearby Moss Side.\n\nSalman's younger brother, Hashem, was also in Libya. He too has been detained by security forces on suspicion of links to IS.\n\nAccording to the family friend, Salman had been living with his father in Tripoli - and then five days ago unexpectedly took his passport and left without warning.\n\nOne of the recent stand-out concerns from security analysts is that Libya - with its easier transport routes across the Mediterranean into Europe - would become a far easier jumping-off point for extremists determined to bring their violence to Britain. It's looking increasingly likely that Salman Abedi's attack has made their point."],[10,"Ariana Grande defies latest terror attack, performs in Manchester","Pop star Ariana Grande took the stage in Manchester Sunday night, less than 24 hours after a deadly terror attack in London, and less than two weeks after an explosion ripped through the concert venue where she performed, killing 22 fans and injuring more than 100.\n\nDonning ripped jeans and a white \"One Love Manchester\" sweater, the singer started upbeat as much of the young crowd - estimated to be at least 60,000 strong - appeared both excited and overwhelmed, declaring her love for the still mourning city. \n\nPart way through the concert, Grande thanked the crowd for their \"love and unity,\" noting that it is \"the medicine the world needs right now.\" She also acknowledged that they had an entirely different show planned but changed much of it the previous day after her meeting with the mother of slain 15-year-old victim, Olivia Campbell. \n\n\"She told me Olivia wouldn't want me to cry,\" Grande said. \"And she would have wanted to hear the hits.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just Grande paying her respects to the city and its victims.\n\nHighlights of the \"One Love Manchester\" benefit included Grande joined by the Black Eyed Peas, performing their 2003 hit \"Where Is the Love?\" which directly addressed the buregoning threat of terrorism in its lyrics, and advocated a message of \"one love.\" Some 14 years later, frontman will.i.am urged the packed crowd to raise a hand in solidarity.\n\nLongtime friends Grande and Miley Cyrus also performed the Crowded House hit \"Don't Dream it's Over,\" and Katy Perry - following an address insisting that \"love conquers hate\" - sang \"Part of Me.\" Justin Bieber's performance too was met with enthusiasm - complete with a glimpse of policemen dancing with children outside the stadium. \n\n\"One Love Manchester\" also featured heartfelt video messages from Stevie Wonder and former soccer star David Beckham, Demi Lovato, Kings of Leon, Rita Ora and Kendall Kardashian.

One member of the public was wounded in the crossfire.\n\nThe attackers were wearing what appeared to be belts of explosives but these turned out later to have been fake, an attempt to strike fear into the crowd.\n\nOver the next six hours, hundreds of police and 80 medics arrived, setting up a cordon and securing the area, evacuating visitors and ferrying 48 people to hospital, many of them critically injured.\n\nAs the terrorists ran into the market, Alex Nypels, a supervisor at Feng Sushi, was locking the restaurant’s glass door to stop any further diners from entering for the night. Inside were five staff and two lingering customers.\n\nA 23-year-old Belgian, Mr Nypels was at the door when one of the attackers, dressed in a red hooded sweatshirt, ran up to him. “He was right in front of me with only the glass of the door between us. He came with a big knife, about 20cm, which had blood on the blade. He was saying, ‘This is for Allah’, and tapped it on the window.\n\n“But he understood the doors were closed so he went across the road to Black and Blue [a steakhouse], which was still open. He went there and I saw people come out of the restaurant crying. It was unbelievable. I’m worried about the people at Black and Blue.”\n\nMr Nypels ushered everyone downstairs to hide in the basement, taking knives from the kitchen for self-defence in case the attackers tried to break in.\n\n“After 30 minutes it was very quiet, so we checked outside,” added Mr Nypels. “But the police told us to stay inside so we went back in. It was about 11pm to 11.15pm that the police came back and told us to leave. They told us to run, run, run and we ran for 10 minutes out of Borough Market. While I was running I saw people on the floor not moving. Nothing. There was a lot of blood.”\n\nAs the men ran from venue to venue along Stoney Street, an as-yet unnamed British Transport Police officer confronted them with his baton, but was seriously wounded.

An off-duty police officer in the area was also injured.\n\nSergeant Symons, a police officer who was on the scene within the hour and was guarding the cordon around the scene on Sunday morning, said the rapid police response was “not unusual”.\n\nA British Transport Police station is across the road from the market, while Southwark police station is half a mile away. “This is a busy area,” he said. “Our usual response time is 12 minutes.”\n\nThe exact route the attackers took through the market, where the police confronted them and whether they split up or worked as a team remain unclear.\n\nBut at least one of them was shot outside the Wheatsheaf on Stoney Street, a Young’s pub, a few hundred metres from where they crashed their van. One witness said another man was shot inside the Globe Tavern deeper inside the market.\n\nSheldon Lewin, 25, a currency trader who lives nearby, said he was lying in bed when he heard bursts of gunshots “about three minutes apart from each other”. He said he had timed the volleys of shots at “around 10.15pm and 10.24pm, when I sent my family a message”.\n\n“The first set I didn’t know what it was, it could have been fireworks; the second set I knew they were gunshots because I heard sirens, which had started in between the first and second gunshots.”\n\nJames Yates, also 25, was at the Katzenjammers bar on Southwark Street when a man came in with a slashed face. “He said there had been multiple stabbings outside,” he said. “A minute or so later, a squad of about eight police sprinted through.”\n\nAs the police tried to establish whether any assailants had entered the bar, they ordered everyone to dive to the ground. “That’s when it started to hit that something was going on,” Mr Yates said.\n\nHis smartphone video of the incident, which has been shared widely on social media, shows police telling people to stay on the floor, as people huddle next to benches, drinks in glasses still sitting on top of the benches and tables.\n\n“Then a second wave of armed police came in and said the whole building was surrounded by armed police and we were safe in the basement,” he said. They were released at around 11pm and told to leave the area.\n\n“It was only when we got outside and saw the people on the pavement that I could see what happened,” he said.\n\n“There were police as far as you could see, there were people on the pavement. One girl was being treated on the floor to my right. She was in the worst condition I saw. That was when it hit.”"],[10,"Low Fell Scooter Club ride out from the Angel of the North in memory of Manchester victims","The video will start in 8Cancel\n\nA gang of Gatesheadmods got together to pay a striking tribute to the victims of the Manchester terror attack on Monday.\n\nLow Fell Scooter Club met at the Angel of the North to have a ride “ride out” on their Vespas in memory of the 22 dead.\n\nTwo of the victims, Philip Tron and Courtney Boyle, were particularly close to the hearts of those taking part.\n\nThey were among those killed when suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, set off a device in the foyer of the Manchester Arena during an Ariana Grande concert.\n\nPhilip was accompanying Courtney, the daughter of his partner, to the venue on May 22 but they never came home.\n\nThe scooter riders set off from the point where hundreds gathered on Friday to release yellow balloons in memory of them.\n\nFlowers and messages of condolences still line the foot of the iconic statue.\n\nOne of the event organisers, Tony Spencer, 52,from Low Fell, knew Philip personally and shared his grief over last week’s terrible event.\n\nHe said: “The idea came from a similar scooter ride out in Manchester who did it in memory of a little girl.\n\n“We decided to get together and do something like that.\n\n“I worked with Philip at The Gateshead Arms - I was a doorman and he worked behind the bar.\n\n“We knew each other pretty well, it affected me.\n\n“He was a really good kid and a really awful thing happened to him.\n\n“Phil liked a laugh, he was really good fun and liked a drink or two.\n\n“I never met Courtney myself but she’s in our thoughts too.

He was trailed on the two occasions he returned to Italian soil. \n\n“I don’t know what the English did, but we constantly monitored him,” Mr Amato said in an interview. “We constantly controlled him, verified him, interviewed him and evaluated him. That’s what is done normally in Italy.” \n\nItalian officials first became concerned about Zaghba after they stopped him at Bologna airport in March 2016 with a one-way ticket to Turkey. One Italian official said he gave conflicting answers about his intentions. Initially he said he wanted to be a “terrorist” — then corrected himself to say he wanted to be a “tourist”. Italian police also found jihadist images on his mobile devices. However, this was not enough to charge him. \n\n“The images demonstrated sympathy for the phenomenon [of jihadism] but this wasn’t criminally relevant,” Mr Amato said. “In Italy, like in the UK, the fact of having common-source images that evoke radicalisation is not a crime. We moved on to a path of prevention and control.”\n\nItalian officials said they warned British authorities of Zaghba’s case and inserted his details into the Schengen Information System, a European database containing the names of individuals considered to be at risk of terrorism. “The communication was exhaustive and complete,” Mr Amato said. \n\nZaghba, who lived in east London, travelled frequently to Italy to visit his 68-year-old mother Valeria Collina, a resident of a small town called Valsamoggia in the hills west of Bologna. He did so once in September 2016, and again between December and January 2017, Italian official said.\n\n“Every time my son came here there was someone from the Digos [a special police unit] following him,” Ms Collina told reporters outside her home, according to Ansa, the Italian press agency.\n\n“They knew very well how worried I was about him and how aware I was about what was going on,” she added.\n\nMs Collina said she spoke to Zaghba last Thursday, two days before the London Bridge attack in which eight people were killed. “That call struck me because there was a special sweetness in his voice, he was particularly tender,” she said. \n\nZaghba travelled from Italy to the UK in January 2017, arriving in Stansted airport, and Italian officials say there is no evidence that he returned to Italy again before the attack. Despite the intense focus on Zaghba in Italy, Scotland Yard said on Tuesday that Zaghba “was not a police or MI5 subject of interest”. Theresa May, the UK prime minister, has ordered a review of MI5’s handling of the London Bridge attack. \n\nBut on the Italian end, officials are adamant they did their part. “Our conscience is clear,” said Franco Gabrielli, Italy’s chief of police."],[10,"Torbay to remember those affected by the London attacks","Torbay will remember those who lost their lives and all others affected by the attacks in London on Saturday night with a minute silence outside the Town Hall.

The pictures are also getting in the way of the searches for real people.\n\nBut they seem also calculated to cause distress to people shown in them – in many cases, they are being used to harass specific people, with malicious social media users sharing pictures of people they don't like.

There have been 14 deaths in the last month alone. The latest occurred on Thursday afternoon, shortly after Dick met concerned parents in Putney, south London, when a 20-year-old man was stabbed in front of his girlfriend as the couple walked to their car, after watching a film in Romford, east London.\n\nCritics warned that an increased reliance on stop and search to tackle knife crime risked making it harder to acquire the policing intelligence needed to effectively protect communities most affected.\n\nSimon Woolley, a former commissioner for race on the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: “I would implore Cressida Dick to rethink this because if she stops every black person and every young person she would reduce knife crime – but at what price?”\n\nWooley, also the director and one of the founders of Operation Black Vote, said the legacy of stop and search meant tackling the current rise in knife crime was more problematic than it might have been.\n\nThe prevailing sentiment among many young black males in London was, he said, that they felt targeted by the police force and therefore did not trust the Met. Last year the official police watchdog said stops of black people remained at an “eye-watering” level compared with stops of white people.\n\nOmar Khan, director of the Runnymede Trust, a racial equality thinktank, said: “Being able to respond to knife crime will definitely be a challenge because communities won’t trust the police. We’ve met young men who’ve been stopped 15 times but never had a conviction.”\n\nFigures published in 2015 found that black people were up to 17.5 times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched by police in certain areas of the UK – statistics that experts said suggested racial profiling.\n\nKhan said research from his organisation along with Stopwatch, a coalition of academics and legal experts which monitors the use of stop and search, repeatedly found evidence of bias against young black men. Dick’s enthusiasm for stop and search was unlikely to have the backing of Theresa May, he said.\n\nAs home secretary, May threatened new laws if the police did not stop abusing their stop and search powers. “May was convinced that stop and search wasn’t a very productive tool, that it was a waste of police resources.”\n\nDuring her tenure as home secretary, Home Office research was published revealing that the use of large-scale “surge” stop and search operations had no discernible effect in reducing crime. However, even critics of the tactic believe stop and search can be used effectively and without damaging community relations. Woolley praised the intelligence-led policing that had led to the arrest of a man carrying knives near the Houses of Parliament.\n\nA Met spokesman said stop and search had been an “invaluable tool” in tackling knife crime and had resulted in more than 3,000 arrests for weapon possession each year.\n\n“Over the past few years we have changed the way we use stop and search – it is now used less and is much more effective. Stop and search must be used in a fair and effective way that supports public confidence and is independently scrutinised. 74% of people surveyed supported our use of stop and search.”"],[10,"Passenger crashes bus by grabbing driver's wheel in China","Nine passengers have been injured in China after one man took control of a coach by force before crashing it, according to local reports.\n\nSurveillance footageshows the moment when the male passenger leaps into the driver's seat and grabs the steering wheel.\n\nA 31-year-old man has been arrested in relation to the case.

The police are treating the attacks as terrorist incidents. Police were called after a white rental van was driven into pedestrians on London Bridge at about 9.58pm on Saturday night. The van continued on to nearby Borough Market where three attackers emerged and carried out multiple stabbings in pubs and restaurants. Armed police arrived and shot the attackers dead within eight minutes of being alerted. The attackers were armed with knives and wore what turned out to be fake suicide vests. On Sunday night, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. “A detachment of Islamic State fighters executed yesterday’s London attack,” said a statement posted on the group’s Amaq media agency website.\n\nThe Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said a Canadian national was among those killed in the attack. The victim was later named as Christine Archibald who had moved to Europe to be with her fiance. “She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected,” her family said in a statement. A French man is among those killed in the attack, the foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, confirmed. Seven people from France were injured, four of them critically. One person is still missing. There were multiple casualties in addition to the deaths. London Ambulance Service said 48 people were taken to five hospitals in the capital and a number of others were treated at the scene for minor injuries. The NHS said on Monday that 18 were in a critical condition. Eight armed police officers fired an estimated 50 rounds during the incident – an unprecedented number for the UK. One member of the public was caught in the gunfire when a bullet struck him in the head. A senior doctor at the Royal London hospital in east London said the man was expected to make a full recovery.\n\nA British Transport Police officer armed only with his baton was stabbed in the face as he tackled the assailants. He suffered serious injuries, but is in a stable condition in hospital. An off-duty Metropolitan police officer was among others injured in the attack. Two more on-duty officers were described as “walking wounded”. At least four Australian citizens were injured, according to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Among them, Candice Hedge from Brisbane was stabbed in the neck and is recovering after being treated in St Thomas’ hospital. A man from New Zealand also suffered serious wounds in the attack. At least four French citizens were harmed, one seriously. Geoff Ho, a journalist with the Sunday Express, was left in intensive care after being stabbed in the throat when he tried to help a wounded bouncer. Police raided two more properties in Newham and Barking in east London early on Monday morning. Counter-terrorist officers detained “a number of people”, the Metropolitan police said. The Met arrested 12 people on Sunday after an operation in Barking in east London. One person, a 55-year-old man, has since been released. On Sunday morning, police raided a block of flats in the area where at least one of the suspects is thought to have lived. Another raid, at a flat in nearby East Ham, followed in the afternoon.\n\nSpeaking outside 10 Downing Street after she had chaired a meeting of Cobra, the government’s emergency committee, Theresa May condemned Islamist extremism and called the ideology a “perversion of Islam”. She said there was “a new trend in the threat we face,” with terrorism breeding terrorism. “It is time to say enough is enough,” she added. The prime minister said there must be changes on four fronts: first, people who are drawn to Islamist extremism must be persuaded that western values are superior. Second, there must be a clampdown on the “safe spaces” on the internet where terrorism breeds. Third, she called for action at home where extremism may be tolerated. “There is – to be frank – far too much tolerance of extremism in our country,” she said. Finally, she proposed a review of counter-terrorism strategy and laws, and suggested longer sentences for some offences. She confirmed that the general election would go ahead on Thursday as planned. After a brief suspension in election campaigning in the wake of the attack a bitter row erupted over cuts to police funding, with Jeremy Corbyn backing calls for May to resign over her record on the issue while she was home secretary. The prime minister dodged accusations that police numbers had fallen by tens of thousands since 2010and that the number of armed officers had also fallen. On a visit to London Bridge on Monday, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he was “furious that these three men are seeking to justify their actions by using the faith that I belong to. The ideology they follow is perverse, it is poisonous, and it has no place in Islam.” Jeremy Corbyn delivered a speech on the attack in Carlisle on Sunday evening. He said that, if he won the election, he would commission a report on Friday on the changing nature of the terrorist threat. He also used the speech to criticise May for ignoring warnings about the impact of police cuts, as well as to criticise the US president, Donald Trump, for his comments about the London Bridge attack.\n\nThe Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre at MI5 headquarters has recommended not to raise the official threat level from severe to critical, suggesting that it believes no more terrorists are at large. The UK will observe a minute’s silence on Tuesday 6 June at 11am in remembrance of those who have lost their lives and all others affected by the attacks. Flags will remain at half-mast on Whitehall government buildings until Tuesday evening. The Home Office has set up a website with information about the support available for people affected by the attacks. A statement from the office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed that French citizens were among the injured. He condemned “an abominable and cowardly attack against our free society”.\n\nPictures have been circulating showing a suspect on the ground in the market. He appears to have canisters strapped to his body. Police say those canisters were part of a fake suicide vest. The use of fake bomb vests was designed to “spread panic and fear”, the prime minister said. The identity of the man is believed to be known by several media outlets, including the Guardian, but they have chosen not to name him in accordance with police wishes.Two people have said they alerted police about his extreme viewsand he is also believed to have featured in a documentary entitled Jihadis Next Door broadcast on Channel 4 last year, in which he was part of a group involved in a confrontation with officers.

France has been on high alert since a number of devestating terror attacks in the country recent years, including the 2015 Paris shooting and the Nice lorry killings last year. \n\nSecurity has been also beefed up at major events across Europe after last week's suicide bombing in Manchester.  Yesterday a bomb disposal robot was to unlock a BMW in Berlin, Germany, after suspicious looking wires were seen attached to the vehicle.  Nearby residences and businesses were evacuated, with police urging others to move towards the backs of buildings.  Police later determined the \"wires\" they spotted were a home-made USB charger."],[10,"HEALTHY HOMEMADE CHOCOLATE BITES","Healthy chocolate bites?\n\nYes you heard right, chocolate can actually be really healthy. Today I’m sharing with you these easy to make ‘healthy homemade chocolate bites’.\n\nI love chocolate. I am definitely a self-confessed chocoholic and in the past you’d often find me working my way through an entire galaxy or dairy milk bar in one sitting.\n\nIf you’re trying to turn over a healthier lifestyle like me, then things like chocolate can be really hard to leave behind.\n\nLately I’ve completely overhauled my cupboards of all things bad and have started only eating healthy yet delicious, nutritious snacks (you can get more inspiration from my post ‘10 Easy Healthy Snacks‘). Chocolate however, is one thing I just couldn’t part with.\n\nI started to limit myself to one cube of dark chocolate a day, then came up with the delicious idea to create my own superfood style, healthy homemade chocolate bites.\n\nMelt the bar of dark chocolate in a pan over a low heat. When the chocolate is melted, line a small tray with some parchment paper. Spoon out the chocolate carefully making little button shapes. Top with small handfuls of dried fruits and nuts. Put the tray in the freezer for a couple of hours. When frozen, remove from the parchment paper and put in a freezable bag or tupperware box.\n\nDark chocolate is really good for you in moderation. It is one of the best sources of antioxidants and can not only improve healthy but can lower the risk of heart disease. Sprinkled with seeds and dried fruits, these bites are super indulgent, without the guilt.\n\nIf you loved this recipe, be sure to check out our ‘Frozen Fruit Yoghurt Bites‘ and our ‘10 Easy Healthy Snacks‘.\n\nWhat do you think of these healthy homemade chocolate bites?

But it is the fact that it was a bombing rather than a low-tech attack which will cause most alarm among Britain’s counter-terrorism officials.\n\nApart from the bombings in Paris in 2015 and Brussels last year, most recent terror attacks in Europe have required little planning or co-ordination. Some, as in Westminster this year and in Nice and Berlin last year, have involved the use of a vehicle to mow down pedestrians. Others used guns or knives, or as in the murder of fusilier Lee Rigby four years to the day before the Manchester Arena bombing, a meat cleaver.\n\nThe attack in Manchester does not appear to have been as sophisticated as those in Brussels and Paris but even the most rudimentary bombing requires preparation. The attacker must acquire or manufacture explosives and a detonator and have enough expertise to detonate the device.\n\nBritain’s counter-terrorist intelligence is better than most of its European counterparts but it is impossible to keep all known radicals under constant surveillance. Police on Tuesday identified the Manchester suicide bomber as 22 year-old Salman Abedi, who was born in the city.\n\nAbedi’s parents moved to Britain from Libya to escape the regime of Muammar Gadafy, joining the large Libyan diaspora in Manchester. If Abedi was already known to the security agencies, they will be alarmed that he was able to assemble a bomb and successfully detonate it without attracting attention. They must establish if he is part of a broader network and, more urgently, if further, co-ordinated attacks are planned or likely.\n\nInvestigators will scour Abedi’s phone and online communications to build up a detailed pattern of his movements in recent weeks and to identify any possible accomplices. A 23-year-old man was arrested in Manchester on Tuesday morning in connection with Monday night’s attack but police gave no details of what role he might have played.\n\nMore armed police have been deployed in Manchester and other British cities, partly to reassure the public in the wake of the bombing. The Metropolitan Police said on Tuesday that they would review security ahead of a number of weekend events, including the FA Cup and Aviva Premiership finals.\n\nThere will be more police around key locations but also at smaller venues which do not usually receive such attention. But the authorities know that, in an open, democratic society, it is impossible to ensure total security. Transforming every theatre, cinema and concert venue in the country into airport-style fortified enclosures would not only be prohibitively expensive but unwelcome to most people in Britain.\n\nThe authorities can derive some satisfaction from the fact that the regional plan for an emergency response to an attack in Manchester worked exactly as it was designed to. Police, hospitals, ambulance services and other first responders all played their allotted role so that the injured were treated quickly, the area around Manchester Arena was secured and the investigation got under way without delay."],[10,"Belfast teenager accused of 'grossly offensive' Manchester bomb post appears in court","A teenager accused of posting a grossly offensive message about the Manchester bombing on social media is to confirm next month if he will contest the charge.\n\nKevin O'Neill appeared before Belfast Magistrates' Court today over comments he allegedly made online in the wake of the atrocity.\n\nThe 19-year-old, from Cliftonville Road in Belfast, faces a charge of improper use of a public electronic communications network.\n\nHe was arrested last month under the Malicious Communications Act.\n\nTwenty-two people were killed and scores more injured when a suicide bomber attacked fans leaving an Ariana Grande pop concert at the Manchester Arena on May 22.\n\nO'Neill spoke only to confirm he understood the charge against him.\n\nDefence solicitor Sarah McKeown requested a two-week adjournment to consider all the papers received in the case.\n\nShe is expected to confirm her client's attitude to the charge on his next appearance.\n\nO'Neill was released on continuing bail to return to court on July 3."],[10,"London Police Refuse to Record Complaint Against Al Quds Marchers Flying Hezbollah's Assault Rifle Flag","Al-Quds Day was instituted by the late Iranian dictator Ruhollah Khomeini to demand the destruction or disestablishment of the State of Israel and the restoration of Quds – Jerusalem – as an Islamic capital.\n\nIn London, al-Quds Day is typically attended by supporters of Hezbollah, a Shi’ite organisation backed by the Iranian regime and proscribed as a terrorist outfit by the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Israel, and the Arab League, amongst others.\n\nCuriously, the European Union as an entity has proscribed only its paramilitary wing, leaving its so-called political wing free to operate unmolested. The United Kingdom has followed the EU’s lead.\n\nThis controversial stance led to a woman attempting to make a complaint to three separate police constables about Hezbollah flags at the al-Quds demonstration on Sunday, with the police refusing to accept it.\n\nThe woman was sure that flying the “terrorist flags”, which depict an assault rifle held overhead in a clenched fist, was an offence, and was concerned that the officers’ refusal to register her complaint would mean they could “do like last time [and] say nobody complained”.\n\n“You need to go and reacquaint yourself with the rules and the law around that particular flag,” an irate inspector told her. “There are specific wordings around when you, or anybody, can claim or refer to it as becoming an offence [to fly the flag],” he said.\n\n“You can’t explain to me [why] a proscribed terrorist organisation [is allowed] to raise its flag on the street,” she countered.\n\n“You’ve got a smartphone, right? You’ve got a smartphone? Google it!” he instructed, before walking away.\n\nShe attempted to press her case, but the inspector dismissed her, saying she had simply “seen a flag of a state”.\n\n“They’re not a state,” she said. “It’s not the flag of a state, it’s the flag of a terrorist organisation.”\n\n“We’re not going to argue that, I’m not here for that,” he snapped. “End of conversation.”\n\nBreitbart London contacted the Metropolitan Police about the incident, and a spokesman confirmed there were no arrests in relation to the flag because “There were no offences under S.13 of the Terrorism Act 2000, displaying an article, such as a flag, in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion that they are a member or supporter of a ‘proscribed organisation’.”\n\nThe College of Policing’s Hate Crime Operational Guidance manual states: “For recording purposes, the perception of the victim, or any other person, is the defining factor in determining whether an incident is a hate incident.\n\n“The victim does not have to justify or provide evidence of their belief, and police officers or staff should not directly challenge this perception. Evidence of the hostility is not required for an incident or crime to be recorded as a hate crime or hate incident.”\n\nSenior police constables, such as Essex police force Assistant Chief Constable Maurice Mason, have previously confirmed that these incredibly loose definitions have led to “hate crimes” being logged after “members of the public [complained] about Nigel Farage, or whatever”.\n\nBreitbart London has contacted the Metropolitan Police to confirm how many complaints and hate incident reports the Met recorded in relation to the al-Quds demonstration."],[10,"Manchester One Love concert: Ariana Grande manager Scooter Braun says 'your love is our hope'","Ariana Grande's manager has echoed the words of a mother of one of the youngsters killed in the Manchester Arena attack.\n\nScooter Braun recounted the message of Olivia Campbell-Hardy's mother, Charlotte, that those who died will “never be victims” while appearing on stage at the One Love Manchester benefit concert.\n\nHe also passed on the words from the 15-year-old's best friend, Adam, who was injured in the attack and was visited by Grande in hospital on Friday night.\n\nMr Braun said: “This tragedy has made us all throw away our divides, our differences, our politics, our adult nature and look to our children.\n\n\"Manchester, your bravery is our hope.

Ten seconds of clapping at the end of her speech suggests relations between the home secretary and the Fed have thawed a little - but not a lot.\n\nThe debate comes as a survey for the organisation suggested 33 out of the 43 English and Welsh forces had scrapped, reduced or merged their neighbourhood policing teams since 2010.\n\nIn recent years, neighbourhood policing teams have been made up of police officers and police community support officers.\n\nThe federation says officers were once able to build links with their local areas, but are now often only able to concentrate on responding to emergencies or carrying out pre-arranged visits to investigate crimes.\n\nThe survey suggests:\n\nMinisters called the funding settlement \"challenging\", but said forces had enough resources and crime was falling.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr White said the Police Federation considered the results of its survey \"deeply worrying\".\n\nHe said: \"What is happening is chief constables are having to make very, very difficult decisions. Do you put resources into policing 999 calls? Or do you put resources into neighbourhoods?

After years of warnings about the impact of policing cuts, has Greater Manchester’s force now dwindled to the point where it can no longer keep us safe?\n\nGMP has seen its budget drop by £180m since 2010, shedding nearly a quarter of its front-line officers and 1,000 support staff as successive government austerity budgets sought to reduce the cost of Britain’s public services.\n\nAnd yet even a decade ago, the then-Chief Constable Michael Todd didn’t believe his 8,000-strong rank of officers was enough, calling on the government to provide more.\n\nIn January 2007 Mr Todd complained GMP was ‘historically under-funded’, adding: “We have to persuade them that a large force such as Greater Manchester, with its crime challenges, needs fair funding to make a difference.”\n\nTodd had wanted 10,000 officers. Since then the region’s population has grown by several hundred thousand to not far short of 3m, international terrorism has brutally landed on our doorstep and a whole range of other complex policing and safety issues - including cyber crime and child grooming - have also emerged into the public eye.\n\nBut in 2017, GMP now has just 6,200 officers.\n\nDespite the government insisting more officers would not have prevented an attack such as last Monday night’s arena bombing, police have long warned that shrinking the ability of neighbourhood officers to gather softer, low-level intelligence on the beat was eroding their ability to fight terror.\n\nIn 2015 award-winning former Manchester police inspector Damien O’Reilly warned Theresa May, then the Home Secretary, that intelligence on possible terrorist attacks had dried up following cuts to local policing. The cuts had had such a dire effect that he had quit the force.\n\nSpeaking at that year’s Police Federation conference, he told her: “I have worked in inner-city Manchester for 15 years.\n\n“I felt passionate about what I was doing, but I had to leave. I couldn’t take it any more because the changes that have been imposed have caused community policing to collapse.\n\n“Intelligence has dried up. There aren’t local officers, they don’t know what’s happening. They’re all reactive, there’s no proactive policing locally. That is the reality ma’am.”\n\nHe added: “Neighbourhood policing is critical to dealing with terrorism.\n\n“We run the risk here of letting communities down, putting officers at risk and ultimately risking national security and I would ask you to seriously consider the budget and the level of cuts over the next five years.”\n\nLast week the Police Federation echoed that view, warning of the security implications of reduced officer numbers. Forces ‘simply do not have the resources’ to manage heightened terror levels’, federation leader Steve White said.\n\nOne senior Greater Manchester police source agreed cuts had left a potential vital channel of intelligence seriously weakened.\n\n“Neighbourhood policing is no longer viable with the numbers that the force has. To think you can plug the gap with police community support officers is laughable,” they said.\n\n“Michael Todd recognised the need for Greater Manchester - a huge conurbation - to have 8,000 officers. He was prepared to take his lobbying to a higher level than local politicians to ensure he got what he wanted.”\n\nWhile in the immediate aftermath of last week’s bombing senior officials and politicians avoided the question of safe policing levels, yesterday the current Chief Constable, Ian Hopkins, chose to address it.\n\nHis verdict, although carefully worded, was also less than reassuring. While admitting any police chief would always want more officers, he added: “Six thousand two hundred does feel like the lower end of what is reasonable.\n\n“I’ve spoken to the mayor about this and Andy Burnham is really keen to try and do something about increasing the level.”\n\nFor his part, Mr Burnham has been vocal about the threat of reduced policing numbers over the last few years.\n\nWhile serving as shadow home secretary in late 2015 he told the M.E.N. further cuts would leave the region unable to deal with the threat of a wide-scale terror attack. A few weeks after that interview, the government effectively did a u-turn on that year’s wave of cutbacks, with senior police sources putting the move down to concerted lobbying of Theresa May.\n\nMr Burnham remained concerned, however. Last April, in the wake of the coordinated suicide bombings in Brussels, he warned cities outside of London were not necessarily equipped to deal with such attacks, thanks to years of cuts to blue-light services, including to neighbourhood policing.\n\n“We need to be able to reassure people that if a Paris- or a Brussels-style attack were to be committed in Britain, particularly outside London, we need to be able to show the capability to deal with it. I think there is a fear among us that it isn’t there … outside London,” he said.\n\nSince last week’s attack it is understood senior political figures in Greater Manchester have been debating precisely what kind of extra resource they should be calling for, having chosen not to wade into the debate in its immediate aftermath.\n\nBut yesterday Mr Burnham again spoke out, echoing Ian Hopkins’ view - albeit in stronger terms.\n\nThe terror threat had now reached its highest ever level at the same time as violent crime, hate crime and fraud are on the up, he pointed out.\n\n“But at the same time policing funding and numbers are going in the opposite direction,” he said.\n\n“Those lines cannot keep going in the opposite direction. There is a bottom line and I think we have gone beneath it.\n\n“Last week was not the time, but now we need to make police funding and numbers an issue. The political parties need to lay out quite clearly their plans for policing over the next three to five years.”\n\nNevertheless as debate rages over neighbourhood policing levels, both the government and the Chief Constable insist the issue is more complex.\n\nIt isn’t just about numbers, said Mr Hopkins.\n\n“The way crime is changing, and the way we have to deal with it, like online technology - whether it be grooming children or monitoring terrorist suspects - is becoming very specialist,” he said. “So the debate can’t only be about police officer numbers. It is about specialist capabilities that we need to keep people safe too.”\n\nHe also pointed out that counter-terror units, including that in the north west, had worked very effectively together nationwide and had had their resources protected.\n\nIn response to mounting criticism last week home secretary Amber Rudd hinted policing numbers may need to be revisited. But she insisted the key to keeping populations safe from terror was not fundamentally about bobbies on the beat.\n\n“There may a conversation to have about policing, we may have that at some stage,” she said. “But now is not that conversation. We must not imply that this terrorist activity may not have taken place if there had been more policing.”\n\nContradicting the view of many frontline officers, she said neighbourhood policing ‘is not where we get the intelligence from’.\n\n“We get the intelligence much more from the Prevent strategy, which engages with local community groups, not through the police. It is not about policing so much as engaging with community leaders in the area,” she said.\n\nUnfortunately in this instance, Prevent doesn’t appear to have worked either.\n\nYesterday it emerged that the government’s controversial anti-radicalisation programme had never heard of suicide bomber Salman Abedi, despite Mrs Rudd’s assertion that it is the government’s key intelligence-gathering channel.\n\nWhether or not higher policing numbers would have been directly relevant to stopping last week’s attack - the debate around which will continue to rage - officer levels and security strategy are now front and centre of the general election campaign.

However, in the end he flew back from a gig in Germany to make an appearance in his home city.\n\nNoel is yet to respond to the tweets, but you can imagine he's not going to be happy when he sees his brother blaming him so publicly for failing to show up.\n\nPreviously, Liam denied the Oasis rumours. When asked by BBC Radio One whether a reunion was a possibility at all, he said: \"No, it ain't. Everyone knows I love our kid. He doesn't speak to me, we don't speak to each other.\n\nCredit: PA Images\n\n\"I'll speak to him some day. It's all very sad, but we'll get over it... I guess it mustn't be nice for my mum... If Oasis ever got back together... if they do, they do. If they don't, they don't.\n\n\"A lot of people go, 'Oh, leave it in the past, you were great then'. Mate, if we ever got back together, it would be happening. There'd be no dodgey gigs, it'd be bang on. So there is unfinished business there, but we'll see what happens. In the meantime, we're two little solo boys doing our little things.\"\n\nHowever the tweets seem to indicate that although Liam was willing to reform for the one-off gig, Noel declined the invitation.\n\nAriana Grande was joined by Coldplay, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Take That, Little Mix, Pharrell and others for yesterday's show. Emotions were high as several artists paid tribute to the 22 people who died in the explosion.\n\nIt's been reported that the benefit gig raised over £2million, in addition to the more than £2million raised from a page on GoFundMe.\n\nTo donate in the United Kingdom, you can text 'LOVE' to 70507 to give £5 or donate online via this dedicated British Red Cross page: http://www.redcross.org.uk/LOVE\n\nFeatured Image Credit: PA Images"],[10,"Gare du Nord: Paris train station EVACUATED as armed police swarm building","Eyewitnesses claim people were ordered to run from the scene by police.\n\nFrench news has reported that officers are looking for \"three dangerous suspects\".\n\nDave James Phillips wrote: \"Police all over Gare du Nord hustling us off the Eurostar train, out of the station and clearing the area.\n\nEVACUATED: Witnesses claim police told them to run from the station\n\nSomething is happening at #GareDuNord train station in Paris.pic.twitter.com/LexA5bfsqH\n\nPolice all over #garedunord hustling us off the #eurostar train, out of the station and clearing the area pic.twitter.com/Ko0pFUawCC\n\nTerrified passengers were told by armed guards to evacuate the Gare du Nord train station in Paris, as French news reports police are on the hunt for \"three dangerous suspects\"\n\nOfficers with guns were stationed inside and outside, while Metro entrances around the station have been shut.\n\nThe incident comes a day after Emmanuel Macron was elected as the youngest ever president of France, defeating right-wing opponent Marine Le Pen.\n\nEarlier in the day, thousands of protesters clashed with police gathered at the Place de la Republique calling for 'resistance' to President Macron.\n\nPolice later confirmed the incident was resolved."],[10,"Manchester One Love: Police dance with members of crowd at tribute concert","Police officers and security guards have been celebrated for their work at the One Love Manchester concert held for the victims of the city’s terror attack – and for their dancing.\n\nFootage has emerged of authorities dancing with members of the crowd on Sunday night as Ariana Grande led a host of artists at the benefit concert for the victims of the Manchester Arena attack, in which 22 people were killed and dozens injured.\n\nOne police officer was filmed dancing and jumping hand-in-hand with children in a circle during Justin Bieber’s performance. The footage quickly went viral, with people on Twitter calling it “beautiful” and “the real spirit of Manchester”.\n\nOther officers and security guards in high vis jackets were seen swaying, jumping and dancing with members of the crowd as Coldplay joined Grande on stage to sing the Oasis hit, \"Don’t Look Back In Anger\", which has been an anthem for Manchester since the tragedy.\n\nOfficers were also seen dancing in the crowd as Coldplay played \"Viva La Vida\".\n\n“Manchester, I love you with all my heart,” 23-year-old Grande told the crowd at the sold-out Old Trafford cricket ground on Sunday night.\n\nShe was joined by a number of British and American music stars for the benefit concert, from Take That and Robbie Williams to Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry. A surprise appearance from Oasis’ Liam Gallagher saw the singer perform a rendition of ‘Live Forever’ with Coldplay before throwing his tambourine into the crowd.\n\nEarlier in the concert, and before launching into her hit \"Side To Side\", Grande told the crowd: \"I want to thank you so much for coming tonight and being so happy and strong and unified.\n\n\"I love you guys so much. This night is the kind of thing the world really needs right now.\"\n\nMoney from the show will go towards the victims of the attack that took place at the end of Grande’s show on 22 May. The suicide bombing killed and injured concertgoers and parents waiting to collect their children at the end of the event.\n\nThe concert helped to raise more than £2m for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund, which is run with Manchester Council and the Red Cross, taking the total amount raised for the victims and their families to more than £10m. "],[10,"Statement from the Mayor of Newham","Sadly ten people have been injured and one person has died during this attack, which I wholeheartedly condemn.

Protesters took to the streets of 15 major British cities. In Israel, hundreds marched in Tel Aviv protesting the war.\n\nThe coalition’s unit in Nottingham declares on its website, that the United States has always been “tempted to use its overwhelming military strength”to try to make up for its relative economic decline, exacerbated by the current crisis.\n\n“This means that the target is shifting to Iran and Syria. There are continual calls for intervention in Syria, and the war of words with Iran continually threatens to boil over into a war of aircraft carriers and bombs in the Straits of Hormuz,” the activists say.\n\nThe protesters compare what they call “current hysteria against Iran”with 2002 debates over the invasion of Iraq. At that time they feared war against Iraq was fatally approaching and held massive demonstrations against it.\n\nJust as before the Iraq war, many experts are also warning to strike Iran would carry too many risks for the US and Israel. But campaigners say observers cannot stop the war.\n\n“We heard it back in 2002. An attack on Iraq would have incalculable consequences across the region, we were told, and therefore will not be risked. Right and wrong, as we now know,”anti-war protesters believe.\n\nThey regret they could not prevent what they call “failed wars”in Iraq and Afghanistan, but reiterate that public opinion is a major threat to those pushing another war in the Middle East. Now they are calling for everyone to come to the streets and protest the gathering threat of war.\n\n“Just as we're winding down the disastrous and unnecessary war in Iraq, the very same people who misled our nation into invading Iraq are now saying that now we need to attack Iran,”they say.\n\nThe marches come as immense tension grows around Iran’s nuclear program, which has resulted in sanctions imposed by the US and EU.\n\n­Hundreds of anti-war activists have rallied in Tel Aviv to warn the authorities against a potential attack on Iran. Protesters began their march at Tel Aviv's Habima Square, before making their way to the city's Meir Park.\n\nCampaigners fear that mounting pressure could escalate into all-out war, the effects of which would reverberate globally.\n\nThe protest grew following a recent spontaneous Facebook campaign in which large numbers Israeli and Iranian citizens united in their opposition to potential war between their countries. The initiators of the phenomenon, however, explained on their Facebook page that they had nothing to do with the Tel Aviv protest march, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports.\n\nThe campaign was launched last week by graphic designer Ronny Edry and his wife, Michal Tamir, who uploaded a poster onto their Facebook page which depicted Edry and his daughter with the words, \"Iranians, we will never bomb your country, we [heart] you.\"\n\nThe image sparked a whole movement, with many other people sending their own similar messages from Israel, Iran, and elsewhere in the world.\n\nOn Saturday, participants on the march held signs with such captions as \"No to War with Iran,\" and \"Talks, not Bombs,\" as well as “No to pre-emptive suicide.”\n\nRecent polls suggest that some 58 per cent of Israeli citizens are against any military strike, RT’s Paula Slier reports from Tel Aviv.\n\nEurope, Israel and the US have accused Iran of enriching uranium in order to build a nuclear weapon.They say the Islamic Republic conceived the data on nuclear experiments.\n\nThe sanctions against Iran came after a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, released in November last year. The UN inspectors raised questions about a possible military dimension to Iran’s program.\n\nIran vehemently denies the accusations and reiterates that its program is solely for civilian energy and medical research.\n\nJeremy Corbyn the chair of the 'Stop the War Coalition' told RT that isolating Iran and allowing Israel to continue with its threats will lead to very dangerous developments. \n\n“The way forward has to be de-escalating the tension and denuclearizing the region, otherwise somebody somewhere is going to develop a nuclear weapon,” he said.\n\nHe urged people to think about the consequences of a possible attack on Iran, saying it would dramatically affect the world economy and result in an incalculable loss of people should it happen.\n\n“If we let slip the dogs of war, we will all regret it,” he concluded.",0,0,"jeremycorbyn"]],"arguments":{},"addedWidgets":{},"removedWidgets":[],"schema":[{"name":"title","type":"\"string\"","metadata":"{}"},{"name":"body","type":"\"string\"","metadata":"{}"},{"name":"Topic","type":"\"integer\"","metadata":"{}"},{"name":"predictions_tfcv_idf","type":"\"integer\"","metadata":"{}"},{"name":"OPostUserSNinRT","type":"\"string\"","metadata":"{}"}],"overflow":false,"aggData":[],"aggSchema":[],"aggOverflow":false,"aggSeriesLimitReached":false,"aggError":"","aggType":"","plotOptions":null,"isJsonSchema":true,"dbfsResultPath":null,"datasetInfos":[]},"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":1515143534061,"submitTime":1515143567319,"finishTime":1515143539188,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"545fe515-2ead-4207-9183-7246f7b5065c"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":226499,"guid":"19b55eb2-e352-4085-945d-ed35c3b204a0","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":26.0,"command":"%md \n\n### Future work:\n\n- Do a better filtering of the urls without clear body article","commandVersion":0,"state":"error","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"d52bf4e0-7202-4c3d-9a88-c4d15c092958"}],"dashboards":[],"guid":"b7f619da-a63f-43c6-aceb-3d6f4eab1a9e","globalVars":{},"iPythonMetadata":null,"inputWidgets":{}};</script>
