In order to collect the metadata necessary for this study\nand to distinguish between two script versions of the same movie, we automatically\n matched each script with an entry in movie database provided by IMDB (The Internet\n Movie Database; data interfaces available at http://www.imdb.com/interfaces). Some\n amount of manual correction was also involved. When  more than one movie with the same\n title was found in IMBD, the match was made with the most popular title\n(the one that received most IMDB votes)\n\nAfter discarding all movies that could not be matched or that had less than 5 IMDB\nvotes, we were left with 617 unique titles with metadata including genre, release\nyear, IMDB rating and no. of IMDB votes and cast distribution.  We then identified\nthe pairs of characters that interact and separated their conversations automatically\nusing simple data processing heuristics. After discarding all pairs that exchanged\nless than 5 conversational exchanges there were 10,292 left, exchanging 220,579\nconversational exchanges (304,713 utterances).  After automatically matching the names\nof the 9,035 involved characters to the list of cast distribution, we used the\ngender of each interpreting actor to infer the fictional gender of a subset of\n3,321 movie characters (we raised the number of gendered 3,774 characters through\n manual annotation). Similarly, we collected the end credit position of a subset\nof 3,321 characters as a proxy for their status.\n\n\nD) Contact:\n\nPlease email any questions to: cristian@cs.cornell.edu (Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil)\n\n***\n***","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":1452567737851,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","commandTitle":null,"showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"nuid":"b2bfd0ed-2c5e-4e9f-9f34-d69e389d2f7d"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":204512,"guid":"6a1db36f-b3b3-4a4f-972a-ccabd7b6302f","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":0.9375,"command":"%md \n## Step 2.

You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start? :-()-: That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man. :-()-: Who? :-()-: A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault. :-()-: When was all this? :-()-: Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself. :-()-: He amputated his own leg? :-()-: Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation. :-()-: Well, they didn't actually mean that. :-()-: Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here. :-()-: Well, is it? :-()-: Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg? :-()-: 108 and still active? :-()-: You're startled? :-()-: Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all. :-()-: Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, \"He worried himself to death?\" or, \"This thing or that killed him?\" :-()-: Very often. :-()-: And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide. :-()-: That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course. :-()-: Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me! :-()-: I surprise you? Now that's news. :-()-: I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it? :-()-: Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course. :-()-: Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?","lost horizon","1937"],[17648.0,"What are these people? :-()-: I don't know.

She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all. :-()-: Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community? :-()-: We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on. :-()-: But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on. :-()-: We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.

How to find what the default values are?\n\nDive into the source!!!\n\n1. Let's find the default value for `docConcentration` now.\n1. Got to Apache Spark package Root: [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/#package](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/#package)\n* search for 'ml' in the search box on the top left (ml is for ml library)\n* Then find the `LDA` by scrolling below on the left to mllib's `clustering` methods and click on `LDA`\n* Then click on the source code link which should take you here:\n  * [https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v1.6.1/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/clustering/LDA.scala](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v1.6.1/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/clustering/LDA.scala)\n  * Now, simply go to the right function and see the following comment block:\n  \n  ```\n  /**\n   * Concentration parameter (commonly named \"alpha\") for the prior placed on documents'\n   * distributions over topics (\"theta\").\n   *\n   * This is the parameter to a Dirichlet distribution, where larger values mean more smoothing\n   * (more regularization).\n   *\n   * If not set by the user, then docConcentration is set automatically. If set to\n   * singleton vector [alpha], then alpha is replicated to a vector of length k in fitting.\n   * Otherwise, the [[docConcentration]] vector must be length k.\n   * (default = automatic)\n   *\n   * Optimizer-specific parameter settings:\n   *  - EM\n   *     - Currently only supports symmetric distributions, so all values in the vector should be\n   *       the same.\n   *     - Values should be > 1.0\n   *     - default = uniformly (50 / k) + 1, where 50/k is common in LDA libraries and +1 follows\n   *       from Asuncion et al. (2009), who recommend a +1 adjustment for EM.\n   *  - Online\n   *     - Values should be >= 0\n   *     - default = uniformly (1.0 / k), following the implementation from\n   *
