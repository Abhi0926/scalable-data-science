thinks that he is going to cause\nor be involved in a fatal accident, but the likelihood is surprisingly high.\njust because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting\nblanks does not mean that you are less guilty.\n\n&gt;i don't know about jon, but i say *all* taking of human life is\n&gt;murder.  and i say murder is wrong in all but one situation:  when\n&gt;it is the only action that will prevent another murder, either of\n&gt;myself or another.\n\nyou mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation?  and, you should\nnote that that situation will never occur.  there are

you attempting to be condescending?\n\n&gt;that the system usually works pretty well is small consolation to\n&gt;the poor innocent bastard getting the lethal injection.  is your\n&gt;personal value

If set to\n   * singleton vector [alpha], then alpha is replicated to a vector of length k in fitting.\n   * Otherwise, the [[docConcentration]] vector must be length k.\n   * (default = automatic)\n   *\n   * Optimizer-specific parameter settings:\n   *  - EM\n   *     - Currently only supports symmetric distributions, so all values in the vector should be\n   *       the same.\n   *     - Values should be > 1.0\n   *     - default = uniformly (50 / k) + 1, where 50/k is common in LDA libraries and +1 follows\n   *       from Asuncion et al. (2009), who recommend a +1 adjustment for EM.\n   *  - Online\n   *     - Values should be >= 0\n   *     - default = uniformly (1.0 / k), following the implementation from\n   *
