This directory is where the notebooks projected from dbc into sbt projects (with extensions of App of with a main function done in sbt compatible IDEs like IntelliJ-IDEA and/or Eclipse-Scala-IDE) will be turned into .md files for rendering and documenting.

This can happen from the .json notebooks that pinot will generate or from the .scala files commited from dbc shard in db/2/2/**.scala
This will only be done for a few example notebooks to show the idea of how one can do the same notebook code with IDE and thus submit directly to a local onpremise cluster or another public cloud.
