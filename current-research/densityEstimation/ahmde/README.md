# Project AHMDE: Adaptive Histogram Minimum Density Estimation 

This is the public research/learning/teaching/coding repository for Project **AHMDE: Adaptive Histogram Density Estimation**.

This programme is partly supported by:

* databricks academic partners program (for distributed cloud computing) 
	* through https://academics.cloud.databricks.com
* research time for this project was party due to:
	* 2009-2015 by industrial consulting revenues of Raazesh Sainudiin
	* 2015, 2016 by the project [CORCON: Correctness by Construction](http://corcon.net/about/), Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union, Marie Curie Actions-People, International Research Staff Exchange Scheme with counter-part funding by The Royal Society of New Zealand (also see [mrs2](https://github.com/raazesh-sainudiin/mrs2)).
