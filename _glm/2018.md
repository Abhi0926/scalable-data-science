This course is coordinated by Dr. Raazesh Sainudiin, a [Researcher in Applied Mathematics and Statistics](http://math.uu.se/research/raazesh-sainudiin/) at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University and a Data Science Consultant at [Combient AB](https://combient.com/) in Stockholm. 

# COURSE

See [1MS369: Generalised Linear Models](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1MS369) for more details.
 
# OFFICIAL CONTENT

Models with different link functions. Binary (logistic) regression, Estimation and model fitting. Residual analysis. Mixed effext models. Hierarchical models. Practical examples. R commands.

# Course Materials

## PDF of lecture slides

1. [Lecture 01](https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/blob/master/_glm/2018/slides/f1v.pdf)

**NOTE:** You need to attend the lectures for content scribed on the board or codes done in class. If you miss a lecture or two you can catchup using slides and going through examples in the text book for the course *Madsen, Henrik; Thyregod, Poul, Introduction to general and generalized linear models, Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC, cop. 2011*. See READING LIST in [1MS369: Generalised Linear Models](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1MS369) to *Find in the Library* at Uppsala University.

# Software - TBD

## Plain R
We can run R from command-line.

## SageMath
We might also use [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) locally during face-to-face interactions. You may also collaborate in [COCALC](https://cocalc.com/) remotely. All needed programming basics will be introduced as needed.

**Prepare your laptop on your own!** but using free [COCALC](https://cocalc.com/) is quite easy for the price.

Follow the download and installation instructions for your Operating System from the following URL:

- [http://www.sagemath.org/download.html](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html)

To test that you have installed correctly do the following:

- On a Mac OS X or Unix/Linux syatem, say you installed sage in a directory inside your home directory called `~/all/software/sage/`, then you can see if the following command launches a Jupyter notebook server successfully:

> $ ~/all/software/sage/SageMath/sage -n jupyter


- Those with Windows should follow the instructions in the following URL and test that the jupyter notebook server launches successfully:
  - [https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows](https://wiki.sagemath.org/SageWindows)

### POSSIBLY

**Download** the SageMath ipynb notebooks for running R codes if they become available from:

 - [https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/glm/2018/jp/](https://github.com/lamastex/scalable-data-science/tree/master/glm/2018/jp/)

After downloading it into the directory you launched the sage jupyter notebook server from. You should be able to see all the jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks by navigating from your jupyter notebook server.

**Individual SageMath Jupyter `.ipynb` Notebooks for R and beyond!**
