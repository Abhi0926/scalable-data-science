SDS-2.2, *Scalable data science from Atlantis*, is a technical course in the area of Big Data, aimed at the needs of Stockholm's data industry.It is an updated of SDS-1.6, *Scalable Data Science from Middle Earth*, aimed at the needs of Christchurch's industry.

SDS-2.2 uses [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) 2.2, a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing via [databricks](https://databricks.com) to compute with datasets that won't fit in a single computer. SDS-1.6 used Spark version 1.6.

The course will introduce Spark's core concepts via hands-on coding, including resilient distributed datasets and map-reduce algorithms, DataFrame
and Spark SQL on Catalyst, scalable machine-learning pipelines in MlLib and vertex programs using
the distributed graph processing framework of GraphX. We will solve instances of real-world big data
decision problems from various scientific domains.

This is being prepared by Raazesh Sainudiin 
with assistance from Tilo Wiklund and Dan Strangberg.
