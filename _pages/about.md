Scalable data science is a technical course in the area of Big Data, aimed at the needs of Stockholm's data industry.  
This course uses Apache Spark 2.2, a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing via databricks to compute with datasets that won't fit in a single computer. 
The course will introduce Spark's core concepts via hands-on coding, including resilient distributed datasets and map-reduce algorithms, DataFrame
and Spark SQL on Catalyst, scalable machine-learning pipelines in MlLib and vertex programs using
the distributed graph processing framework of GraphX. We will solve instances of real-world big data
decision problems from various scientific domains.

This is being prepared by Raazesh Sainudiin 
with assistance from Tilo Wiklund and Dan Strangberg.
